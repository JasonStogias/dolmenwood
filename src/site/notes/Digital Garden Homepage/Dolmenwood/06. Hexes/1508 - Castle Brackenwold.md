# Castle Brackenwold 

The fortified castle and keep of the Dukes of Brackenwold  watch over the southern eaves of Dolmenwood from atop a steep, rocky hill, a great town sprawled below.  

### **Town walls:** 
An outer wall girds the town’s lower class quarters, while a second wall wards the Inner City, home to great markets, traders’ districts, courts of law, and public institutions of learning.  

### **Seat of the Duchy:** 
The town is the capital of the Duchy of  Brackenwold, and the Duke of Brackenwold, his family, and court dwell within the castle.  

### **Seat of the bishop:**
The Bishop of Brackenwold also dwells within the castle, beside the Seminary of 100 Martyrs, where priests of the Pluritine Church are trained.  
 
### **Monarch’s Hill and Erligstone**  
A mile south of the town, a wide hill rises up from the  surrounding fields, its sides clad with oak woods and  heather. As ducal property (at least notionally), the hill  is untilled, though flocks of sheep roam and graze here.
