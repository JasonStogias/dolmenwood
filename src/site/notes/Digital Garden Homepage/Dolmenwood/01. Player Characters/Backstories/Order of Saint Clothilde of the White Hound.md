**üïØÔ∏è Saint Clotilde of the White Hound**

_Patron Saint of Seekers, Herbalists, and the Lost_  
_Revered by the Order of the White Hound at Wormhollow Abbey_

**The Mortal Life of Clotilde**

In the mossy centuries before the current calendar, **Clotilde of Wyrmdelve** was born to a minor noble family near the wild forest edge in what is now the Duchy of Brackenwold. Rather than embrace the fineries of her house, Clotilde lived in a hut of turf and ivy. She forsook her birthright and walked barefoot into the Dolmenwood, claiming that ‚Äú_no honest thing grows from polished floors._‚Äù

She became known as a **wanderer**, a **healer**, and **a finder of lost things**. Peasants claimed she could locate missing children, buried bones, poisoned roots, and even tears that had been shed in secret. She never charged coin, but she _did_ ask folk to taste strange brews or bury sacred herbs beneath their thresholds. She was called mad by many‚Äîuntil the miracles began.

**The Hound Appears**

At the age of 33, Clotilde vanished for three days and was found again at the base of an ancient standing stone, half-buried in moss and carved with antlers and spiral tongues. At her side stood a **great hound, white as curdled moonlight**, with eyes the colour of rain on stone.

The hound never left her side again.

Witnesses claimed it could speak‚Äînot in words exactly, but in a **language of howls, scent, and vision**. Wherever the hound sniffed, truths were revealed. When it growled, secrets unburied themselves. And when it howled, people wept‚Äîconvinced they were remembering something long forgotten.

From then on, **Clotilde called herself only ‚Äúthe Hand of the Hound.‚Äù** She wandered further into the woods, giving sermons no one could follow, blessing mushrooms and bitter leaves, and guiding the broken-hearted to their rest.

**The Ascension and the Truffle**

It is said that one morning, she was seen sitting cross-legged, eyes closed, feeding the White Hound with a morsel from a black truffle. Those who beheld it claim the air shimmered like oil on water, and **both woman and hound vanished**, leaving only a perfect circle of sprouting toadstools.

Later legends say that the **truffle she fed the hound was the "Fruit of First Soil"**, a sacred object of immense spiritual power‚Äîcapable of revealing the purest truth of any being who consumed it.

According to secret monastic writings, before her Ascension, the Hound buried **one last truffle**, grown from Clotilde‚Äôs own hands and breath, **somewhere in Dolmenwood**.

**Symbolism and Veneration**

Clotilde is depicted with **bare feet**, a **cowl of moss**, and her ever-faithful **White Hound** by her side. She is sometimes shown offering a mushroom, or whispering into the hound‚Äôs ear while it gazes into the dark.

Her followers believe that **taste is divine**, and that the mouth is a gateway to hidden truth. Her monks and friars often train in **foraging, healing, fasting, and scent rituals**‚Äîseeking to ‚Äúunmask the soul through flavour.‚Äù

She is prayed to by:

- **Herbalists**, who need clarity in gathering.
- **Lost travelers**, who ask the Hound to guide them.
- **Penitents**, who hope that truth may be found and forgiven.

**Relics and Lore**

- **The White Leash of Revelation** ‚Äì Said to have been woven from the saint‚Äôs hair, it causes beasts‚Äîand sometimes men‚Äîto confess their secrets when bound.
- **The Mushroom-Eye of Clotilde** ‚Äì A sacred truffle that never decays. Whoever bites it is said to see visions of their truest self.
- **The Last Truffle** ‚Äì The most coveted relic of all; believed to be hidden somewhere in Dolmenwood. Those who seek it are warned: truth has a flavour, and it may be bitter.
