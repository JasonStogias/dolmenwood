**Race**: [Grimalkin](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=grimalkin) 
**Class**: [Enchanter](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=enchanter)  
**Gender**: Unisex

**Backstory**: 
Mx Whiskers grew up in a wealthy, luxurious home somewhere in [[Digital Garden Homepage/Dolmenwood/05. Places/Fairy\|Fairy]], surrounded by love from its parents and siblings. Their life was comfortable, filled with laughter and the warmth of family. However, that happiness was shattered when Mx Whiskers' entire family tragically died after eating something toxic. The shock of this event changed Mx Whiskers' life forever. While others moved on, Mx Whiskers could never shake the feeling that something wasn’t right about the way their family died. Driven by grief and a fierce need to protect those it cares for, Mx Whiskers turned to the study of **enchantment magic**—a path that would allow it to manipulate the world, ward off danger, and ensure that such a tragedy never happened again.

Now, Mx Whiskers seeks not only to protect its future loved ones but also to uncover the truth behind what really happened to its family. 

As a child, Mx Whiskers found joy in the humorous tales of a legendary breggle knight named [[Digital Garden Homepage/Dolmenwood/01. Player Characters/Backstories/Ατ\|Ατ]], whose adventures were filled with heroic blunders and laughable mistakes. Despite the knight's good intentions, every story would end with At fumbling in some ridiculous way. Those stories of At's imperfections have stuck with Mx Whiskers, reminding it that even in failure, there is strength and wisdom to be found.

Mx Whiskers' posh family home was located in **Lankshorn**, a market town near the southern border of Dolmenwood. Lankshorn is ruled by the breggle aristocracy and is known for blending the more civilized traditions of the south with the strange, superstitious ways of Dolmenwood. The town's blend of refinement and local peculiarities suited Mx Whiskers' family, who lived comfortably, surrounded by both wealth and a sense of mystery.

Lankshorn’s proximity to the deeper, wilder parts of Dolmenwood meant that Mx Whiskers grew up in a place where fairy tales and magical happenings were always close at hand, making it the perfect backdrop for the more whimsical stories of Knight At.

As all cats in Dolmenwood, its goddess is [[Digital Garden Homepage/Dolmenwood/04. NPCs/Queen Abyssinia\|Queen Abyssinia]] of the [[Digital Garden Homepage/Dolmenwood/04. NPCs/Queen Abyssinia#The Realm of Catland\|Realm of Catland]] in Fairy.

**Personality**:  
Mx Whiskers is cautious and observant, always on the lookout for potential dangers, especially when it comes to food and substances. Though it has a sharp mind, its love of humor, shaped by the tales of At, keeps it grounded and playful. Mx Whiskers cares deeply for its companions, and while it uses its magic to protect them, it also approaches problems with a mix of practicality and wit.
