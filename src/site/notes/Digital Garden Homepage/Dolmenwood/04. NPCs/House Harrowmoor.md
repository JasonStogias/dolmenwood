## Domain 
A broad region of forest at the heart of Dolmenwood, stretching from the  
town of Prigwort in the east to the shores of Lake Longmere in the west.  

## Seat
Harrowmoor Keep, located on the southerly cliffs of the Groaning Loch.  

## Head
Lady Theatrice Harrowmoor. A famed intellect and expert on matters historical, Lady Harrowmoor is cool-headed but not cold-hearted. Of late, she has taken  more direct involvement in the affairs of Prigwort, bolstering the town guard  against the growing presence of crookhorn ruffians in the area.
