#### **Ser Rellin of Fethford** - Woldish Beggar-Knight


{ #8baa9a}


#SerRellinBeggarKnight
A beggar-knight, whose mind is clouded and travels the lands of Dolmenwood.

Sir Oswin promised him a spiritual mushroom, and he delivered, although he did not know what that mushroom actually did.
He vows to follow Oswin if he "left him a crumb of truth".

Oswin will have to ask him what the mushroom did next time he sees him, and find a way to get him to follow him.
