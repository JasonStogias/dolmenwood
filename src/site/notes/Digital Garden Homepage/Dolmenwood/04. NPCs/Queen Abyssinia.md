## Queen Abyssinia

Ruler of Catland, also known as the Queen of All Cats. 
The fearsome Queen Abyssinia is a fairy of odd heritage, half elfish, half grimalkin. She appears as a tall, slender woman dressed all in silver, with straight, silver hair, green, feline eyes, and needle-like claws as long as her fingers. She is volatile, reckless, spiteful, and whimsical.

## The Realm of Catland
A hidden realm of gloomy woods, mazy rocks, and bewildering caverns. This is the native realm of grimalkins.

Murquine Palace: The palace of Queen Abyssinia: a palazzo of some fantastic proportion, its domes, spires, halls, and parlours said to extend infinitely. 

## Former Ally of the Cold Prince
Queen Abyssinia was once an ally of the [[Digital Garden Homepage/Dolmenwood/04. NPCs/Factions#4. The Cold Prince\|Cold Prince]], but spurned him long ago.
