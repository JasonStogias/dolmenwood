Welcome to
Dolmenwood

D

“

olmenwood? Well, let me tell ye, everything you ever
heard about the Wood is true and everything you
ever heard is false. Dreams and fairies walk between
standing stones and dancing trees, slipping in and out of the
mortal world as easily as you or I slip through an open door.
It’s right pretty though. Dare I say, beautiful even. All manner
of enchantment lingers beneath its boughs. It’ll capture your
heart if ye let it. And that sounds as lovely as a song until you
realise the Wood’ll never, ever give it back without paying the
proper cost.”
—Ogham Tweede, bartender

Part One | Welcome to Dolmenwood

The Journey Begins
A wanderer’s first steps into the tricksome and beguiling Dolmenwood.

T

his book is a gateway to adventure in the beguiling realm of Dolmenwood—a swathe of tangled
woods, fungus-encrusted glades, and foetid
marsh on the wild borders of civilisation. Rife with
intrigue, secrets, and magic, Dolmenwood draws travellers of adventurous spirit, daring them to venture within.
Explore the wild places of the Wood, travelling through
bramble-choked dells, fungal forests, and accursed
bogland, bedding down among root and bracken amid
the nocturnal babbling of strange beasts.
Unearth treasure hoards in forgotten fairy ruins, haunted
manors, dripping caverns, crystal grottoes, unhallowed
barrow mounds, and abandoned delvings.
Confront fell beasts, roving fungal monstrosities, terrible
wyrms, tricksome fairies, and restless spirits of the long
deceased.
Recover saintly relics and shrines lost in the befuddling
tangle of the Wood, gaining the favour of the Church by
returning them to civilisation.
Forage for weird fungi and herbs in the untrod depths of
the woods, many with useful magical powers—and many
that can be sold for profit.
Strike against Chaos, defending civilisation from the
encroaching forces of the wicked, half-unicorn Nag-Lord
who lurks in the corrupted northern woods.
Unravel secrets of deep magic, charting the obelisks,
dolmens, and ley lines littered throughout Dolmenwood—
but beware the sinister Drune cult that wards them.
Seek the counsel of witches or the sinister Hag, wielders
of magic that can heal, hex, or divine the future.
Meddle in the affairs of nobility, allying with a noble
house in its intrigues and power plays in the courts of
High-Hankle and Castle Brackenwold.
Journey along fairy roads, ancient magical paths bordering on the ageless world of Fairy that allow travel throughout Dolmenwood—and perchance to realms beyond.
Return to the homely hearth to share tales of peril with
quaint locals over a mug of ale and a well-stoked pipe.

Part One | Welcome to Dolmenwood

Folk and Factions
Introducing the folk of Dolmenwood and the factions that vie for control.

Sentient Folk

While humans dominate the settled reaches of Dolmenwood, they are not the only folk to call the place home.

Breggles
The High Wold region of south-western Dolmenwood has
been ruled since ancient times by the goat-headed breggles. Breggles divide themselves into two castes, distinguished by the length of their horns—the aristocratic
longhorns and the commoner shorthorns.

Mosslings
The dank, fungal-infested lowlands of Mulchgrove, in the
eastern woods, are home to a shy and stunted folk called
mosslings, part mortal flesh and part plant or fungus.

Fairies and Demi-Fey
Among the myriad peoples of Fairy, a number venture
into Dolmenwood and mingle with mortal folk: elves,
otherworldly and beautiful, the little cat-folk known
as grimalkins, and bat-faced woodgrues are the most
commonly encountered.

Other Sentient Beings
If one ventures off the beaten track in Dolmenwood,
innumerable creatures await discovery. Goblin tricksters
peddle fairy fruits and other questionable wares; scrabies
emerge from their network of tunnels, eager to explore;
even a bird or animal may surprise travellers by greeting
them from the wayside, spinning a riddle, or cursing their
trespass.

Factions and Powers
The Duchy of Brackenwold
Ruling from the supposedly impregnable Castle Brackenwold on the south-eastern verge of the forest, the Dukes
of Brackenwold trace their line back to the earliest settlers
in the region. All mortal folk within the Wood—from the
humblest beggar to the highest lord—pay fealty to the
duke. The whole forest is his property.

The Pluritine Church
The monotheistic Pluritine Church dominates throughout
Dolmenwood and beyond. While it holds much political
clout, the Church is of late diminished in Dolmenwood.
Many shrines and chapels that once saw regular worship
have fallen into ruin and been reclaimed by the forest.
Some within the Church seek to rediscover and re-sanctify
these lost shrines.

8

The Cold Prince
Where mortals now reign, great fairy nobles once held
court. The entirety of Dolmenwood was once the domain
of a cruel elf lord known as the Cold Prince, lord of winter
eternal, who ruled from the palace of Hoarblight Keep
overlooking the great Lake Longmere. When humans
began to settle the wild glades a great war between fairy
and mortal ensued. Mortals eventually prevailed and the
Cold Prince was banished to his domain in Fairy. Fearful
tales of his return to Dolmenwood and his icy wrath weave
a common thread through the folklore of those who dwell
within his erstwhile domain.

The Nag-Lord
A wicked, trickster figure of local folklore, said to keep
unholy court in the twisted northern woods, where his
armies of corrupted breggles and other creatures of Chaos
lair. The Nag-Lord is known in folktales as the “King of the
Wood,” and is portrayed as being part man, part unicorn,
with nine legs (nine being regarded as an especially
accursed number).

The Drune
A cabal of sorcerers who roam the Wood, cloaked in black.
They claim the magical energies of Dolmenwood and what
gods they worship is a matter of conjecture, for they guard
their secrets with their lives. In the eyes of the Church they
are heathens to be eradicated, for it is said they deal in
devil worship and human sacrifice. Kidnap by the Drune
is among the greatest fears of the simple folk of Dolmenwood, who refer to the cult as “the Hooded Men,” fearing
to speak the word “Drune.”

The Witches
Mortal women who worship ancient deities in the forbidden depths of Dolmenwood. Their aims are obscure, but
it is known that they gather beneath the moon to work
magic. In folklore, witches are variously portrayed as
depraved practitioners of human sacrifice, treacherous
wielders of hex and illusion, and ministers of potent cures
and charms.

Ygraine the Sorceress
A reclusive figure said to be the most powerful magician in Dolmenwood, Ygraine dwells in the many-tiered
Chateau Mauvesse, overlooking the black waters of the
Dark Mirror. It is rumoured that her explorations of otherworldly realms have brought her into contact with the
Cold Prince and that she now works her magic to release
him from exile.

Part One | Welcome to Dolmenwood

Dolmenwood Gazetteer
The most commonly traversed or spoken of regions of the Wood.
Castle Brackenwold
The seat of the Duchy of Brackenwold and ancestral home
to the nobility of the line, Castle Brackenwold perches
upon a high hill with a city stretched at its feet. Alongside
the mighty ducal garrison is a great cathedral—the seat of
the Church’s power in Dolmenwood.

Dreg and Shantywood Isle
A port and fishing village beside the River Hameth. Dreg
has a seedy reputation as a haunt for thieves, gamblers,
and rascals of all stripes, only worsened by its proximity
to Shantywood Isle, a notorious port of ill-repute. Dreg is
also famed for its fine bog-swine sausages.

Fort Vulgar
A crude keep overlooking a port at the northern end of
Lake Longmere. Fort Vulgar is ruled by Sir Osric the Gaunt,
a vassal of the Duke of Brackenwold who is responsible for
the taxation of all traffic via the port.

Hag’s Addle
A shunned region of mazy swampland around the banks
of the River Hameth, haunted by the sinister Hag. It is said
that she glimpses into the past and future and resurrects
the dead, but the price she demands in return is perilous.

High-Hankle

Dolmenwood Map
A map of Dolmenwood is found inside the book’s front
cover. This map depicts the Wood as described by local
folk, including the purported locations of certain sites
mentioned in legend and folklore.

The World of Fairy
The timeless world of Fairy—the native world of elves
and grimalkins, where magic permeates all things—lies
parallel to the mortal world. In Dolmenwood, the veil
between the two worlds is thin, and magical doorways
and roads allow fairies to slip into the mortal world.

Mulchgrove
The central region of the Wood is a dank lowland riddled
with fungal forests, treacherous bogs, and twisted willowwoods. The region is little traversed save by sentient fungal
monstrosities and the native mosslings, at home amongst
the dew-kissed fungi and moulds.

The Nagwood
The northern woods, corrupted by the presence of the
court of the wicked Nag-Lord and his foul armies. None
of sound mind venture within this twisted region of evil.

Prigwort

The second largest town in Dolmenwood (after Castle
Brackenwold), High-Hankle is the ancient capital of the
High Wold region, now reputed for revelry, carousing, and
debauchery of every flavour. At its centre stands the imposing Castle Perigonne, home of the Baron Hogwarsh.

The market town of Prigwort is the largest settlement
beneath the forest’s eaves. Famed for its breweries and
distilleries, Prigwort is ruled by a council known as the
Brewmasters. Connoisseurs across the land covet the fine
spirits of Prigwort.

The High Wold

The Ruined Abbey of St Clewyd

A barony encompassing the south-western corner of
Dolmenwood, ruled in tandem by breggle and human
noble houses. The barony has become wild of late under the
lax rule of Baron Hogwarsh: highwaymen hunt the roads
and charlatans peddle questionable wares.

East of Lake Longmere, in the depths of Dolmenwood, a
great monastery was founded of old. The abbey has lain
in ruins for a century following a nocturnal assault of
unknown provenance.

Lake Longmere

In the western reaches of Dolmenwood is found a vast ring
of frost-rimed stones, erected by the ancients for purpose
long forgotten. The folk of Dolmenwood name them the
“Summerstones” and the great ring which they inscribe
the “Witching Ring.”

The great Lake Longmere, at the centre of Dolmenwood,
is twelve miles broad at its widest point. No ships ply its
waters, and locals speak fearfully of lake monsters.

Lankshorn
The market town of Lankshorn, ruled by the breggle aristocracy, lies within a bowshot of the forest’s border. In
Lankshorn, the traditions of the civilised south meld with
the quaint, superstitious ways of Dolmenwood.

The Witching Ring

The Woodcutters’ Encampment
Once a mere woodcutters’ camp, the village is now a thriving trade community. The locals practice unusual arts of
woodcraft and are said to show no fear of the Drune.

dventure! Yes, a fine thing for folks such as yourself,
with a spring in your step and a yearning to see the
world. But make sure you’re properly prepared and
have your saints in a row, as they say, before you step off the
path and into the wild. There’s all manner of weird beasties out
there you need to watch out for. Bogeys, redcaps, pooks, marsh
lanterns, slime-hulks, boggins, mogglewomps, cockatrices. The

On Role-Playing Games
Introducing the noble art of adventure gaming.

A
world.

Role-Playing Game (RPG) is, at its core, a shared
on-going narrative exploring the adventures of
a group of imagined characters in an imagined

When kids play cops and robbers, they’re role-playing. The
difference is that in an RPG such as Dolmenwood, the game
rules provide a framework that prevents the inevitable
“Bang, bang, I got you!” followed by “No you didn’t!” The
rules in this book provide structure, but pure role-playing
is simply imagining yourself as a character in a certain
situation and deciding what they would do.
Each player takes on the role of a single character in the
game, with one person acting as the Referee, describing the
world perceived by the others. The Referee also role-plays
other people and creatures the players encounter, from
humble shopkeepers to rampaging ogres.

New to Role-Playing Games?
This book explains the game rules in an easy-to-learn
way, including examples of how the rules work in
practice. For players with no prior experience of RPGs,
however, more direct experience can be useful to grasp
how the written rules and free-form narrative procedure work together.
If you’ve never played an RPG before, by far the easiest
way to learn how they work is to simply dive in and play.
If you have friends who already play, just ask to join
them for a game or two. Failing that, it can be instructive to watch other people playing. There are many
live streams and YouTube channels online, including
recordings of groups exploring Dolmenwood.

Basic Play Example

Emily (playing Grendl Lockehorn, a breggle knight), James
(playing Samwise Lank, a human friar), and Jeff (playing
Boots Pouncemouse, a grimalkin enchanter) are exploring
the verdant oddities of Dolmenwood when they encounter
a lone goblin with a strange prize. Let’s listen in as Gavin,
the Referee, narrates the scene.
Gavin (Referee): You’ve been away from the village for
three days and are now deep in the wilderness. The trees
bend and twist, creating a net through which only the
occasional glimpse of starlight manages to reach down
and touch your eyes. The woods are gloomy by day, but
by night the darkness feels suffocating. The sounds of the
wilderness echo between the ancient trees and clawing
brush that surround the small clearing where you’ve made
camp. You’ve lit a small campfire for warmth. Do you want
to use the same order of watches through the night as you
used yesterday?
Emily (playing Grendl): Yep. Grendl is on first watch, Jeff
is on second watch. Samwise is on third watch.
Gavin: Great. You all settle down to sleep. It’s now the
middle of the night, so that’d be second watch. Jeff, what’s
Boots doing while he’s on watch.
Jeff (playing Boots): He’s reading through the little holy
book Samwise is always studying, giggling at how silly
human religion is—but he looks up every now and again in
a half-hearted effort that barely passes for being on guard.
James (playing Samwise): Hey! Put that back!
Jeff: You’re asleep. You weren’t using it. I’ll put it back before
you wake up.

Required Materials

Gavin: You’re laughing at a passage you find to be particularly silly about St Thorm when you notice a second voice
joining your laughter. A piping, tittering laugh echoes
through the woods. It’s not loud enough to wake your
friends, but it’s clearly heard.

All players need the following basic items to play
Dolmenwood. Players may share, but it is more convenient for each player to have their own.

Jeff: I leap to my feet and throw the holy book at Samwise.
Wake him up and give him his book back all at once.
Gavin: Give me a ranged Attack Roll.

This book: The Dolmenwood Player’s Book.

Jeff: <Rolls a 20-sided die> Umm, sorry James. <Looks to
Gavin> I rolled a 1.

Dice: A set of standard RPG dice, including 4-sided,
6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, and 20-sided dice.
Character sheet: A sheet to record character details.
This can be an official character sheet (downloaded
from dolmenwood.com) or a piece of blank paper.
Notebook: Pencils, blank paper, and gridded paper (or
equivalent software) for making notes and mapping.
Referee’s requirements: The person taking on the role
of the Referee also needs the Dolmenwood Campaign
Book and the Dolmenwood Monster Book.

12

James: You what?!
Gavin: The book slips from your grip and flies off into the
brush, but you hear a thud as it hits something other than
vegetation. You hear a new sound that wakes everyone up.
It’s the sound of a baby crying, wailing in fear. As Grendl
and Samwise come to, the three of you see a goblin with a
massive head and great googly, yellow eyes peering at you.
It clutches a swaddled newborn human child, no older than
a few days old, in its spindly arms.
Emily: I draw my sword and move forward.

P a r t Tw o | S t a r t i n g P l a y

James: Wait! We can’t risk endangering the baby. Maybe
we can talk the goblin into giving it up.
Jeff: You want to negotiate with a goblin?
James: Yes. The kid is probably from the village. Remember that rumour about missing and cursed children we
heard? <To Gavin> Samwise takes a step towards the
goblin, slowly, and raises a hand before speaking: “Greetings friend! Welcome to our humble camp site.”
Emily: Grendl doesn’t trust goblins after the incident at the
ruined farmstead a few sessions ago with the bag of hen’s
teeth and the spinning wheel. She is waiting for the first
sign of a threat to attack.
Jeff: Boots slowly rises to his feet, but I don’t draw a weapon
or anything. I give the goblin a casual wave and a quick
smile like he’s an old friend.
Gavin: Alright, the goblin clutches the child and seems
almost to lick his lips for a second as his eyes dart between
the three of you. “Can’t have my precious gift, not by steel
nor riddling shrift. Can’t have my sack, no won’t give it
back!”
Emily: Oh, he’s gonna get it…
Jeff: Boots casually remarks “Well, ya know stealing human
children is a tricky business. Gotta find the right market for
a seller. I hear harpies will trade ‘em for a song…”
James: Jeff!
Gavin (speaking as the goblin): “Child, child not for me.
Master, master’s property. I do as bid, no surprise, and
return to Master his secret prize. Though sprig of rosemary
is in my bag, neither it nor child is yours to be had.”
Jeff (as Boots): “Well, glad you’ve got that covered.” <Out
of character> Sorry guys. I got nothing.
Emily: If you guys don’t do something, I’m gonna risk
attacking him.
James: Rosemary, eh? I have an idea. “Rosemary you say?
I’m in need of some rosemary for my garden! Perhaps we
could trade.”
Gavin (as the goblin): “No trade with friar. Never trust a
holy liar.”
James (as Samwise): “Don’t you at least want to see what I
have? It could be shiny.”
Gavin: The goblin eyes you suspiciously.
Emily: He’s not buying it.
James: I pull out that gilded letter we got from the elf courtier a few months back and wave it in front of the goblin,
trying to catch its edges in the firelight so it twinkles.
Emily: You kept that?

Gavin: The goblin’s eyes catch on the letter and he nods
eagerly. “Yes, yes! Gold is best, best. You give Grimble-Grot
the letter and everything get better. If I like the trade, a deal
can be made.”
James: I slowly approach the goblin and hand him the
letter.
Gavin: He snatches it with one hand, clutching the wailing
child tighter in his free arm. He begins to read it. What’s
it say?
James: <Flips through his character sheet notes> “The one
who receives this letter is invited to palaver under a banner
of peace with its bearer until dawn under the promise of
an exchange to be made before sunrise as a sign of good
faith between Mortal and Fairy.”
Jeff: I get it! The goblin took the letter, now he’s under Oath
of Invitation and can’t cross us!
James: Bingo. Also because he took the letter, it means he
agreed to the trade.
Gavin: Clever!
Emily (as Grendl): “You have accepted the golden gilded
letter as a gift! We ask the child in exchange!”
Gavin (as the goblin): “Gifts must be named for gifts to be
claimed.”
James: You said it’s a newborn human child?
Gavin: Yeah.
James (as Samwise): “The child has no name. As an
ordained clergyman, I name her Rosemary! You offered
rosemary! By your name, Grimble-Grot, I hold you to your
word.”
Gavin: <Considers the impromptu trick and decides it
seems feasible enough to work—a fun and creative idea
from James> The goblin lets out a vexed hiss and shoves
the child roughly into Grendl’s free arm. “Cursed human,
so smart on two legs. Foul your beer, rot your eggs!” The
goblin scampers off into the woods. His voice echoes back,
“Master’s prize will bring you only sorrow. It shall come to
you tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow.”
Jeff: Wow. I can’t believe that worked. Boots pipes up after
watching the whole exchange: “We’ve got some new problems, guys. In addition to bad beer and rotten eggs in the
near future, we’ve got a newborn baby and we’re three days
deep into the forest without a wet-nurse or fresh swaddling clothes, cursed by a goblin, and someone known as
‘Master’ is mad at us. Oh, and goblins never travel alone.”
Gavin: Boots is right. That’s when you hear the cackling of
goblins echo in the dark from all directions around your
camp…

James: I keep everything.

Dice Rolling Notation
Similar to many other role-playing games, Dolmenwood uses polyhedral dice, each referred to by the
number of sides it has:
▶ d4: A four-sided die.
▶ d6: A normal six-sided die.
▶ d8: An eight-sided die.
▶ d10: A ten-sided die.
▶ d12: A twelve-sided die.
▶ d20: A twenty-sided die.

Multi-Dice Rolls
In situations where multiple dice should be rolled and
the results summed, the number of dice is noted before
the “d.” For example, 3d6 indicates that three six-sided
dice should be rolled and the results added together.

Modifiers
Modifiers to the roll are applied after the results of all
dice have been summed. For example, 3d6+2 indicates
that three six-sided dice should be rolled, the results
added together, then 2 added on top.

“Natural” Results
The rules occasionally refer to the “natural” result of
rolling dice (e.g. “a natural 20”). This means the number
rolled on the die, before any modifiers are applied.

d2 and d3
Two-sided or three-sided dice can be mimicked using a
d6. For a d2, a roll of 1–3 indicates ‘one’ and 4–6 indicates
‘two’. For a d3, a roll of 1–2 indicates ‘one’, 3–4 indicates
‘two’, and 5–6 indicates ‘three’.

d100 / d%
A hundred-sided die (sometimes called a percentile
die) requires rolling two d10s: the first treated as “tens”
and the second treated as “ones.” For example, a roll of
2 and 3 would make 23. If two 0s are rolled, the result
counts as 100.

Chance Rolls
Some rules specify a chance of success, either as a
percentage (e.g. 35%) or using an X-in-Y notation (e.g.
2-in-6). This indicates that the appropriate die type
should be rolled (i.e. a d100 for a percentage chance, a
d6 for an X-in-6 chance, etc.) and the result compared
against the specified chance. If the roll is within the
specified range of success, the check succeeds.

Probability Curves
It is important to note that multi-dice rolls produce a
bell curve, where middle value results are more likely.
For example, when rolling 3d6, there is a 12.5% chance
of rolling a 10, and only a 0.46% chance of rolling a 3.
The rules sometimes make use of this behaviour in
situations where certain results are far more likely, for
example when rolling Ability Scores (p22).

Character Statistics
The basic game statistics that describe an adventurer.

P

layer Characters are described by a set of statistics
defining their capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world.

Ability Scores
The ratings of an adventurer’s defining physical and
mental attributes. There are 6 Abilities: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.
See Ability Scores, p22. Ability Scores are recorded as
numbers between 3–18, with 3 being the worst score possible and 18 the best.

Kindred
A character may be human or one of a number of types of
fantastic intelligent creatures that live in Dolmenwood.
Each Kindred has a number of special traits, from fairy
magic to bonuses in combat. The Kindreds players may
choose from are: breggle, elf, grimalkin, human, mossling,
woodgrue. See Part Three: Kindreds, p28.
Size: A character’s Kindred determines their size: either
human-sized (Medium) or smaller than human-sized
(Small).
Creature type: A character’s Kindred determines their
creature type as demi-fey, fairy, or mortal.
Native languages: A character’s Kindred determines their
native languages.

Class
A character’s role or profession as an adventurer. Each
Class has a number of special traits, from combat talents
to spell-casting. The Classes players may choose from are:
bard, cleric, enchanter, fighter, friar, hunter, knight, magician, thief. See Part Four: Classes, p57.

Experience Points (XP)
A character’s advancement in the game is tracked by the
accumulation of experience points. Experience Points
are awarded by the Referee after a successful adventure.
When a character has accumulated a certain number of
Experience Points, their Level increases. Each Class specifies the number of Experience Points required to achieve
each Level.

Prime Abilities
The Ability (or Abilities) most important to a character’s
Class. A character with high scores in their Prime Abilities
may gain a bonus to Experience Points awarded by the
Referee. Conversely, a character with a low score in a Prime
Ability may suffer a penalty to awarded Experience Points.
See Prime Abilities, p22.

Hit Points (HP)
A character’s ability to avoid dying. A character has a maximum Hit Point total and a current Hit Point total, which
are tracked separately.
Rolling Hit Points: A character’s Hit Points are rolled with
a die type determined by their Class (for example, fighters
roll 1d8 and magicians roll 1d4). When play begins, current
Hit Points and maximum Hit Points have the same value.
Damage: When a character is harmed, their current Hit
Point total is reduced. If this number reaches 0, the character dies. See p145.
Healing: Rest or healing can restore lost Hit Points up to
the character’s maximum Hit Points. See p160.

Weapons and armour: A character’s Class determines
which kinds of weapons and armour they can use.

Gaining Levels: When a character gains a Level, a die is
rolled and the result added to their maximum Hit Points.
The type of die rolled is determined by the character’s
Class. As Hit Points increase, characters are able to combat
more dangerous foes and face greater adversity.

Level

Armour Class (AC)

A character’s expertise as an adventurer is denoted by their
Level. Characters typically start play at Level 1 (the lowest
Level of adventurer) and can increase in Level through
successful adventuring. As a character goes up in Level,
they gain more powerful capabilities, as defined by their
Class. This book contains rules for characters up to Level 15.

A character’s ability to avoid damage in combat. Armour
Class is determined by the character’s armour and their
Dexterity score.
Default Armour Class: An unarmoured character with
average Dexterity has AC 10.

Combat Aptitude
A character’s aptitude in combat is classified as martial,
semi-martial, or non-martial, determined by their Class.
For example, fighter is a martial Class and magician a
non-martial Class. Combat Aptitude determines how
quickly a character’s Attack and Save Targets advance.

16

P a r t Tw o | S t a r t i n g P l a y

Attack
A character’s ability to hit foes in combat, determined by
their Class and Level. A character’s Attack is a bonus added
to Attack Rolls. See Attack Rolls, p145.
Gaining Levels: As characters advance in Level, their
Attack gets higher, increasing their chance of hitting opponents in combat.

Save Targets
A character’s ability to avoid certain dangerous or detrimental effects, determined by their Class and Level. Save
Targets are the numbers to match or exceed for a successful Saving Throw. There are five Saving Throw categories,
each representing a common type of effect: Doom, Ray,
Hold, Blast, Spell. See Saving Throws, p145.
Gaining Levels: As characters advance in Level, their Save
Targets get lower, improving their chance of avoiding
detrimental effects.

Magic Resistance

Monster Statistics
While this book does not contain a full bestiary, game
statistics for a small number of monsters and animals
are present (e.g. for mounts which can be purchased or
creatures that can be summoned by magic). Monsters,
animals, and NPCs are described with a simplified set
of statistics listing the main stats required for combat.
Monster statistics are mostly the same as those used for
characters, but the following points are worth noting.
Size: Human-sized (Medium), smaller than humansized (Small), or larger than human-sized (Large).
Type: Animal, bug, construct, demi-fey, dragon, fairy,
fungus, monstrosity, mortal, ooze, plant, or undead.
Intelligence: Mindless, Animal Intelligence, Semi-Intelligent, Sentient, or Genius.
HP: The dice rolled to determine a monster’s Hit Points,
with the average value noted in parentheses.
Saves: The monster’s Save Targets, listed using the
following initials: D(oom), R(ay), H(old), B(last), S(pell).

A modifier applied to Saving Throws against effects of
magical origin, determined by a character’s Wisdom and
Kindred. This may include saves against magical effects
in any Saving Throw category, though does not normally
apply to saves against breath attacks, such as wyrm breath.

Att: The attacks the monster can make each Round,
with the Attack bonus and damage in parentheses.

Speed

Example: Prigwort Prancer

The speed at which a character can move when exploring,
travelling, or during combat. See Time and Movement,
p146.

Large Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral

Morale: The monster’s courage, ferocity, and persistence in battle. See Morale, p167.
XP: The XP award for defeating the monster.

Level 2 AC 12 HP 2d8 (9) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att 2 hooves (+1, 1d4) Speed 80 Morale 7 XP 20

Default Speed: The default Speed for characters is 40. This
may be adjusted by the amount of gear and treasure a character is carrying. See Encumbrance, p148.

Skills
Skills represent specific competencies useful in adventuring. As professional adventurers, all characters have basic
competence with certain common activities—listening,
searching, and wilderness survival. Some Classes grant the
use of additional, specialised skills. See Skill Checks, p144.

Alignment
Characters (and all other creatures) are classified as Lawful,
Neutral, or Chaotic. Alignment determines how certain
magic influences a character and should be used by the
player as a guideline for role-playing. See Alignment, p24.

Background
A secondary profession or skill set gained due to a character’s upbringing or life prior to becoming a professional
adventurer. Backgrounds play no mechanical role in the
game rules, but the Referee may use them as an aid to judging which actions a character can perform. See Is a Roll
Warranted?, p139 and Narrative Interaction, p150.

Creating a Character
How to create a novice adventurer, ready to brave the befuddling Dolmenwood.

W

hen creating a character, you need a character
sheet—pictured to the right. The Dolmenwood
character sheet is available online at dolmenwood.com as a PDF to download and print.
A note on randomness: Many character statistics are
determined by rolling dice. You are encouraged to savour
the fun, unexpected character concepts that emerge from
interpreting these random results. The character creation
example (p20) demonstrates this.

1. Roll Ability Scores

Roll 3d6 for each of your character’s Ability Scores in turn:
Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution,
and Charisma. See Ability Scores, p22.

Sub-Par Characters (Optional Rule)
If you roll a character with an 8 or less in every Ability Score
or a 6 or lower in more than one Ability Score, you may
choose to discard the character and start again.

2. Choose a Kindred

Select one of the Kindreds in Part Three: Kindreds, p28.
New players: The human Kindred is recommended, as it
has the least special traits.
Class restrictions: Elves, grimalkins, and woodgrues
cannot be clerics or friars as they have no spiritual connection with the deities of mortals.

3. Choose a Class

Select one of the Classes in Part Four: Classes, p57,
bearing in mind the Prime Abilities of each Class (see the
Summary of Classes table).
New players: The fighter Class is recommended, as it has
the least special traits.

4. Adjust Ability Scores

If you wish, you may raise your character’s Prime Abilities
by lowering other (non-Prime) Ability Scores. For every 2
points by which an Ability Score is lowered, 1 point may be
added to a Prime Ability. No Ability Score may be lowered
below 9, and no Prime Ability may be raised above 13 by
adjustment.

5. Note Ability Modifiers

Now that your character’s Ability Scores have been determined, make a note of any associated bonuses or penalties.
See Ability Scores, p22.

18

6. Note Kindred and
Class Traits

Record any special traits possessed by your character as a
result of their Kindred and Class, including the following.
Attack: The advancement table for your character’s Class
lists your Attack. This value indicates your character’s
chance of hitting opponents in combat.
Save Targets: The advancement table for your character’s
Class lists your Save Targets. These are the target numbers
used when making Saving Throws to avoid different kinds
of dangerous or detrimental effects.
Skill Targets: Note your character’s target numbers for
Listen, Search, and Survival Skill Checks. All skills default
to a target number of 6, unless your character’s Kindred or
Class specifies a lower target number.
Languages: Your character’s native languages are listed in
the Kindred description. This always includes the Woldish tongue spoken by all folk in Dolmenwood. Characters
with high Intelligence (see Ability Scores, p22) may also
choose additional languages from the list on p26.

2 preserved rations, a waterskin, and a tinder box. A belt
pouch containing 3d6 gold pieces.
Class items: Weapons, armour, and special items as noted
in your character’s Class.

9. Note Armour Class

Your character’s Armour Class is determined by their
armour (see Armour and Weapons, p118) plus their
Dexterity Modifier (see Ability Scores, p22). Some
Kindreds and Classes also grant a bonus to AC.
Unarmoured AC: If your character has no armour, their
AC is 10 plus their Dexterity Modifier.

10. Note Speed

Determine your character’s Speed based on the amount of
equipment carried (see Encumbrance, p148).

Chaotic (see Alignment, p24) and note this on your
character sheet.

Adventuring items: Choose or roll up to 4 items from the
Adventuring Items table.

Class restrictions: Clerics and friars may not be Chaotic.

Trinket: An odd, possibly slightly magical item, rolled on
the trinkets table for your character’s Kindred.

12. Note Level and XP

Buying Equipment (Optional Rule)

Example of
Creating a Character
An adventurer emerges from a player’s choices and interpretation of die rolls.

1. Roll Ability Scores

The player rolls 3d6 for each Ability Score in turn:
Strength: 9. An average score.
Intelligence: 8. Slightly below average.
Wisdom: 15. A very good score.
Dexterity: 6. A rather poor score.
Constitution: 16. A lucky roll—an excellent score.
Charisma: 11. An average score.
A picture of the character is already forming. Their high
Constitution and Wisdom suggest a hardy character with a
strong connection with the spiritual. Their poor Dexterity
and below average Intelligence suggest a rustic character
with little interest in intellectual or artistic pursuits.

2. Choose a Kindred

Kindred is selected based on player preference, although
the Referee may sometimes wish to limit available options.
For example, some Referees prefer to restrict Player Characters to mortal Kindreds, or even to humans only.
The picture formed by the rolled Ability Scores brings
an elderly breggle to the player’s mind—still hale (high
Constitution) but somewhat doddery with age (low Dexterity). The Referee approves this choice.

3. Choose a Class

Class is selected based on player preference and Prime
Abilities. While Classes do not have any Ability Score
requirements, an especially good roll in an Ability indicates suitability for any Class with that Prime Ability.
Looking at the rolled Ability Scores once more, the player
focuses on the high Wisdom—an indicator of spiritual
insight. The player envisages a mild-mannered individual,
with a strong personal connection to the divine.
Cleric and friar both use Wisdom as a Prime Ability. The
player selects friar—a better fit with their conception of
the character.

20

4. Adjust Ability Scores

The player has the option of lowering non-Prime Ability
Scores in order to raise Prime Abilities, on a two-for-one
exchange. As Wisdom and Intelligence are the character’s
Prime Abilities (as a friar), they may only lower Strength,
Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma.
Raising the character’s Prime Abilities can be beneficial
either to gain a bonus to earned Experience Points (if all
Prime Abilities are 13 or higher) or for the other bonuses
associated with the Ability Scores (e.g. higher Wisdom
grants a bonus to resist magical effects).
Noting that one of the character’s Prime Abilities is below
9 (which would incur an Experience Point penalty), the
player considers making an adjustment. Wishing to keep
the high Constitution score, the only option is to lower
Charisma. Subtracting 2 points from Charisma, the player
raises the character’s Intelligence by 1, resulting in the
following Ability Scores: Strength 9, Intelligence 9, Wisdom
15, Dexterity 6, Constitution 16, Charisma 9.

5. Note Ability Modifiers

Now that the character’s Ability Scores are established,
the player consults the Ability Modifiers table (p22)
and records all relevant modifiers on the character sheet,
as follows:
Strength: 9. Average; no Modifier.
Intelligence: 9. Average; no Modifier.
Wisdom: 15. +1 Modifier.
Dexterity: 6. –1 Modifier.
Constitution: 16. +2 Modifier.
Charisma: 9. Average; no Modifier.

P a r t Tw o | S t a r t i n g P l a y

6. Note Kindred and
Class Traits

Reading over the breggle and friar descriptions once more,
the player makes notes on their special traits. Breggles
have a natural horn attack and fur that grants an AC bonus.
Friars have an increased chance of success with Survival
when foraging, gain an AC bonus, may attack with culinary
implements, gain a bonus when using medicinal herbs,
cast holy spells (a single Rank 1 spell for a Level 1 friar), and
can attempt to turn the undead.
Attack: The player consults the friar advancement table
and notes the character’s Attack: +0 for a Level 1 friar. This
bonus is applied when making Attack Rolls, in addition to
any modifiers due to Strength or Dexterity.
Save Targets: Consulting the friar advancement table
again, the player notes the character’s Save Targets: Doom
11, Ray 12, Hold 13, Blast 16, Spell 14. They also note that the
character’s Wisdom Modifier (+1) grants them +1 Magic
Resistance.
Skill Targets: Friars do not have any specialised skills,
but they do have a lower Skill Target with Survival when
foraging.
Languages: The character knows all languages listed in the
breggle Kindred description: Woldish, Gaffe, and Caprice.
Friars also gain a bonus language: Liturgic (the Church
scriptural tongue). As the character has average Intelligence (9), they do not gain additional languages.

7. Roll Hit Points

Level 1 friars have 1d4 Hit Points. The player rolls a 3. Adding
the Constitution Modifier, the character starts with 5 Hit
Points.

8. Roll Equipment

The player rolls a few dice to determine the character’s
starting equipment. General items: Common clothing, a
backpack, 2 preserved rations, a waterskin, a tinder box, a
belt pouch, and 10 gold pieces. Friar class items: A dagger,
a friar’s habit, and a wooden holy symbol. Adventuring
items: A shovel and a lantern (randomly rolled), plus 2 oil
flasks (selected from the list). Breggle trinket: A gnarled
root shaped like a mossling.
Mulling over the randomly determined items, the player
imagines the friar as a keen forager (hence the shovel) who
has recently unearthed a curious specimen that they now
seek sagacious advice on (the mossling-shaped root).

10. Note Speed

The Referee informs the player that the slot encumbrance
rules are in use (see Encumbrance, p148). Carrying 3
equipped items—a dagger, a lantern, and a belt pouch with
10gp and the gnarled root—the character has a base Speed
of 40. The character’s backpack with 8 stowed items does
not further reduce their Speed.
The player notes Speed 40 on the character sheet.

11. Choose Alignment

The player considers which of the three alignments
(Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic) best suit the character.
They decide on Lawful, due to the character’s benevolent,
well-meaning demeanour.

12. Note Level and XP

The character is Level 1 and has 0 XP as they begin their
adventuring career.

13. Name and Details

Name: Looking at the breggle names table, the player
decides that the character is female and rolls the name
Crewwin Wolder.
Background: A roll on the breggle background table comes
up with magician’s assistant. An unusual result, considering the character’s low Intelligence and devout calling. The
player considers discarding the result and re-rolling but
then hits upon the idea of Crewwin having been a reluctant
magician’s apprentice in her youth. She was eventually
cast out for sanctimoniously refusing to cooperate with
her erstwhile master’s nefarious schemes.
Other details: Rolling on the other breggle detail tables,
the following results emerge: Crewwin’s ears are pierced
with nails (perhaps a form of religious penance), she has
missing teeth (due to age), her fur is grey and greasy (due to
a life on the road), her voice is throaty, she is a wild hedonist
(the player decides to re-roll this ill-fitting result and gets
“ale-addled”—a more likely proposition for a friar), she
wears a grimy apron (to protect her habit from mud when
digging for roots), she desires to escape justice for a past
crime (perhaps her former master still seeks to apprehend
her), and believes that the end of the world is nigh (perhaps
due to prophetic dreams).
Crewwin Wolder is now ready for adventure!

9. Note Armour Class

Since friars cannot wear armour of any kind, the character’s base AC is 10. This is reduced to 9 by the character’s low Dexterity (–1 Modifier), increased to 10 by the
character’s thick breggle fur, and finally increased to 12
by the friar’s Armour of Faith trait. Overall, the character
is poorly defended and would be wise to avoid combat
where possible.

Alignment
The three fundamental modes of behaviour that drive all creatures.

A

lignments are cosmic principles that represent
broad world views and modes of behaviour. All
beings are categorised under one of three alignments: Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic.

Lawful

Lawful beings are trustworthy, believe in protecting
others, and act for the good of the group. They obey the
rules of society and strive for fairness and justice.
On a philosophical level, Law represents the belief in goodness, order, truth, and justice as the natural order of the
universe.

Neutral

Neutral beings cooperate with others as long as it is not to
their own detriment. They treat others as they are themselves treated and believe in self-reliance. Beings of less
than human intelligence that act purely on instinct (e.g.
normal animals) are classified as Neutral.
On a philosophical level, Neutrality represents the belief
in a balance between the forces of Law and Chaos, with
neither side dominant.

Chaotic

Chaotic beings lie and use others to expedite their own
ends, with no concern for the good of the group. They casually break laws and violate norms, driven by the belief that
the rules are as arbitrary as their own whims.
On a philosophical level, Chaos represents a belief in
the meaninglessness and randomness of the universe,
wherein the individual’s selfish desires are utmost. This
principle can usually be equated with evil.

Revealing Alignment

Players must inform the Referee of their characters’ Alignment, but they do not have to tell other players.

Role-Playing Alignment

Players should consider their character’s Alignment when
determining their actions. The Referee may call the player’s
attention to deeds that contradict the chosen Alignment.
If a character repeatedly behaves in a manner contrary to
their Alignment, the Referee may suggest that they change
to an Alignment better fitting to their behaviour.

Alignment and Magic

In addition to its role as a broad guide to character behaviour, Alignment influences the way some magic affects
characters. Some spells only affect creatures of certain
Alignment (for example, the holy spell Mantle of Protection). Likewise, some magic items have special properties
related to Alignment.

P a r t Tw o | S t a r t i n g P l a y

Advancement
How adventurers gain experience and grow in power.

A

dventurers begin play at Level 1 with no Experience Points. Those who have success in
adventuring gain Experience Points, gradually
accumulating enough to increase in Level.

Party XP Awards

A party that survives an adventure and returns to safety
gains Experience Points (XP). XP is awarded by the Referee,
based on how successful the adventure was. The main
factors are as follows. The Dolmenwood Campaign Book
has full details on awarding XP, including optional rules
for additional kinds of XP awards.
Treasure: The party gains 1 XP per 1 gold piece value of
treasure recovered. Recovered treasure is the primary
source of XP, usually accounting for three-quarters or
more of total XP earned.
Foes defeated: The party gains XP for every foe defeated
(i.e. slain, outsmarted, captured, scared away, etc.). The
XP award for a creature is determined by its Level and the
number of potent special traits it has.

Dividing Party XP

All XP awarded to the party is totalled and divided evenly
between all party members who survived the adventure.
Awarded XP is always divided evenly, irrespective of how
the party decides to divide treasure.

Prime Ability XP Modifiers
Characters with especially low or high scores in their
Class’s Prime Abilities receive a bonus or penalty applied
to XP awarded to them (see Prime Abilities, p22).

Retainers
Retainers (see p134) are treated somewhat differently
than Player Characters.
Townsfolk retainers: Do not gain XP, so are not counted as
party members for the purposes of XP division.
Adventurer retainers: Adventurer retainers are counted
as party members for the purposes of XP division. As
retainers follow instructions from PCs, rather than independently making decisions, all XP they earn is halved.
Example: A party of four PCs, three adventurer retainers, and
two townsfolk retainers is awarded a total of 7,000 XP. This
total is divided by 7 (4 PCs + 3 retainers—not counting the
townsfolk), resulting in an award of 1,000 XP per character.
The PCs gain 1,000 XP each and the retainers gain 500 XP each.

Maximum XP Per Session

A character cannot advance more than one Level in a single
session. Any additional XP that would take a character two
or more Levels above their current Level are lost, leaving
the character at 1 XP below the total for the next Level.

Levelling Up

When a character gains enough XP to reach the next Level
(found on the advancement table for each Class), update
the character sheet with improvements.
1. Hit Points: Increase the character’s current and maximum Hit Points by the amount listed.
2. Attack and Save Targets: Note any improvements to
Attack and Save Targets listed.
3. Spells and skills: Note any change in Skill Targets and
the number of spells the character can use each day, as
applicable to the Class.
4. Other Kindred or Class traits: Note any additional traits
that the character is able to use due to their increased
Level. (Some Kindred and Class traits can only be used
by characters of a certain Level.)
5. XP for next Level: Note the XP total required for the
next Level.
Example: Sedgewick the magician is Level 3 with 9,400 XP,
just short of the 10,000 needed to reach Level 4. Following
a particularly successful adventure, he gains an additional
5,000 XP. This brings his XP total to 14,400—enough to reach
Level 4. The player consults the magician Class description
to see what benefits Sedgewick gains. Firstly, he gains 1d4 Hit
Points (the player rolls a 2 and adds this to Sedgewick’s HP
total). Secondly, the player notes improved Attack and Save
Targets. Thirdly, the player notes the ability to memorise one
additional Rank 2 spell per day. Sedgewick requires a total of
20,000 XP to reach Level 5.

Training (Optional Rule)

The Referee may require characters to engage in a period of
training in order to level up. Until the training is complete,
the character cannot advance to the next Level and can
gain no further XP.
Training with a mentor: A character may train under
a mentor of the same Class and higher Level. Training
requires 1–4 weeks. The Referee may determine the training time randomly (1d4) or may base it on the player’s
performance (e.g. clever play, successful use of Class capabilities, etc.). Training under a mentor costs 250gp per week
per Level of the trainee.
Training alone: If the character trains alone, the cost is
halved but the time required is doubled.

Languages
The tongues and cants of the sentient folk of Dolmenwood.

A

multitude of languages, dialects, and cants are
spoken within Dolmenwood, from the common
tongues of mortal folk to the otherworldly intonations of Fairy. Many of these languages can be learned
by Player Characters (see Player Character Languages),
while others are the sole province of ancient fairies and
learned sages.

The Common Tongue
Woldish
The language spoken by virtually all sentient creatures in
Dolmenwood. Woldish is a dialect of the common tongue
that is spoken in the wider world beyond the Wood.

Old Woldish
The language of the folk who entered Dolmenwood and
founded the Kingdom (now Duchy) of Brackenwold.
Learning: Although Old Woldish is no longer spoken, its
study is common among the well-educated.

26

Player Character Languages
A Player Character’s native languages are determined
by their Kindred. All characters speak Woldish, and
some Kindreds speak other mortal or fairy languages.
High Intelligence: Characters with a high Intelligence
(see Ability Scores, p22) may roll or select additional
languages from the list below.

Dwelve, High Elfish (fairies only), Merfolk, Mulch, Wyrm.

P a r t Tw o | S t a r t i n g P l a y

Breggle Tongues
Caprice
A language evolved among the breggle aristocracy of the
High Wold, encompassing greatly simplified elements of
the High Elfish tongue melded with the more eloquent
components of Gaffe. A large canon of literature exists in
this language, written at times in an abridged form of the
High Elfish script and at times in the Woldish script.
Learning: Caprice is in common use and easily learned.

Gaffe
The native tongue of lower ranking breggles: a melodic
language of bleats and gurgles. Gaffe includes many words
derived from Woldish and, though it is of utterly different
origin, shares a small number of words with the Sylvan
language.
Learning: Gaffe is in common use and easily learned.

The Scriptural Tongue
Liturgic
The holy language of the Pluritine Church, used extensively in scripture and sermon. The origins of Liturgic lie in
a land far removed from Dolmenwood, but its usage is now
common throughout many lands due to the expansions of
the Church. It is a purely scriptural language and is seldom
spoken outside of sermons.
Learning: Liturgic is in common use and easily learned.
Fairies and demi-fey, as they have no spiritual connection
with the deities of mortals, cannot learn Liturgic and find
its tones somewhat unpleasant.

Fairy Tongues
The Immortal Tongue of Fairy
The language of the most elevated denizens of the Fairy
world—those ancient beings said to be older than the
mortal world itself. The immortal tongue is of such primal
potency that all sentient beings understand its honeyed
tones. However, only under the most incredibly portentous circumstances may a mortal expect to hear this
speech. The most ancient of fairy folk are little more than
legend, and their language is practically mythical.
Learning: No mortal or lesser fairy may speak the undying
tongue, and those who attempt to study its treasury of
words are beset by hex and misfortune.

High Elfish
The language of the fairy nobility (for example, the Cold
Prince and his retinue) is a derivative of the Immortal
Tongue of Fairy. The predilection of fairy nobles for the
outlandishly baroque is reflected in the convoluted grammar and voluminous lexicon.

Mewl
The secret language of the grimalkins and other cat-like
fairies. Mundane cats can also converse in this tongue
(often to their surprise!), if addressed, and prove eloquent
conversationalists.
Learning: Cat fairies take grave offence at others (especially mortals!) studying their language and go to great
lengths to prevent knowledge of its sprawling vocabulary
and subtle variations of yowl from propagating.

Sylvan
The common speech of the fairies and demi-fey of Dolmenwood, believed to be distantly derived from the Immortal
Tongue of Fairy.
Learning: Sylvan is in common use and easily learned.

Dwelve
The common speech of fairies and demi-fey that dwell in
the underworld beneath Dolmenwood, as well as those
with whom they trade. Distantly related to High Elfish.
Learning: Dwelve is not commonly spoken by surface
dwellers, but is easily learned by those with the desire.

The Mossling Tongue
Mulch
An obscure tongue spoken by mosslings and some sentient
species of plants and fungi.
Learning: The squelching, grinding sounds of which
Mulch consists are notoriously difficult for other Kindreds
to reproduce, though a handful of sages have made rudimentary studies of the language.

Drunic Tongues
Drunic
The language used for everyday communication among
the Drune, as well as in ritual, scripture, and historical
records. Numerous are the standing stones in Dolmenwood which are inscribed with runes of the Drunic tongue.
Learning: Drunic and its intricate script are a closely
guarded secret of the Drune.

Old Drunic
The sacred tongue of the ancestors of the Drune—an
esoteric language of great antiquity, only found in the
most ancient records in the hidden vaults of the Drune.
Learning: Old Drunic is virtually lost. Only the most
erudite Drune sages have any knowledge of it.

Learning: Mortal scholars view High Elfish as the most
fiendishly complex language ever devised. Due to its intricacy, this tongue is virtually impossible for non-fairies to
learn. Even fairies of the lower castes find it impenetrable.

“

kindred you’ve ever met and a few you’ve probably
never heard of. And don’t let the distinction fool you:
mortals, fairies, demi-fey. Who has a soul and who doesn’t?
All of that is theological balderdash. All folk bold or foolhardy
enough to step beneath the great green canopy of Dolmenwood share one absolutely delightful feature worth its weight
in song: they’re always, always full of surprises. Now, can I

Mortals, Fairies,
and Demi-Fey
On the three principal types of sentient folk in Dolmenwood.

K

indreds of sentient folk are classified as one of
three types: mortal, fairy, or demi-fey. From
among the myriad Kindreds of each type that
inhabit Dolmenwood, this book presents six as playable
character options. This section describes the generalities
of fairies, mortals, and demi-fey. The Kindreds that players
can select are then elucidated in the following pages.

No Innate Magic

Mortals

Worship of deities and other powers (e.g. exalted heroes,
ancestors, spirits of the natural world) is common among
mortal folk—see Religion in Dolmenwood, p178. Religion
and worship often play a dominant role in their societies
and daily lives. Mortals who dedicate themselves to the
service of a religion may receive blessings in the form of
holy magic.

Kindreds whose origins are within the confines of the
mortal world.
Playable Kindreds: Breggles, humans, and mosslings.

Mortality
Mortals are swept along on the currents of time: ageing,
deteriorating, and dying like all things in the natural
world. Their lifespans are counted in decades, and they
suffer from all manner of diseases and ailments.

Mossling

30

Breggle

Woodgrue

Aside from a few individuals gifted with a sensitivity to
arcane energies, mortal Kindreds have no innate magic.
The majority of mortal folk are mistrustful of magic,
regarding it as perilous and unnatural.

Religion and Worldview

Mindset
Governed by the laws of time and nature, mortals tend to
be social creatures, banding together for safety and cooperation. The towns and villages of mortal folk in Dolmenwood act as a respite from the dangers of the wild.

Human

Grimalkin

Elf

P a r t T h r e e | K i n d r e ds

Fairies

Fairies, Cold Iron, and Silver

Kindreds that originate in the undying world of Fairy.
Most fairies never venture into the mortal world, but some
romantic, obsessive, or adventurous individuals gain a
taste for the place and tarry for extended periods.

Susceptibility to cold iron: As the basest of all metals,
iron is anathema to the rarefied bodies of fairies. Fairies
suffer additional damage if hit with cold iron weapons
(see p119).

Playable Kindreds: Elves and grimalkins.

Repulsion to silver: While not as intrinsically harmful
to fairies as cold iron, mortal silver is more vehemently
scorned. The touch of the metal is repulsive to fairies,
instantly bringing on a queasiness of the stomach.

Immortality
While fairies may be killed, they remain untouched by the
ravages of time and do not die naturally. Likewise, fairies
are immune to diseases of non-magical origin.

Demi-fey: Demi-fey retain their ancestors’ vulnerability to cold iron, but have dwelt in the mortal world long
enough to become accustomed to mortal silver.

Innate Magic
As natives of the other world, where the logic of the mortal
world does not hold, fairies possess innate magic—known
as glamours—that amazes and confounds mortals. Glamours take many forms, but powers of illusion, inveiglement, enchantment, and vanishing are common.

Otherworldliness
Unless disguised by magic, fairies always carry an air of
unearthliness about them in the mortal world. This may
be perceived by mortals as awe-inspiring, intoxicating,
fearsome, or dreadful. Animals invariably find fairies
unnerving.

Religion and Worldview
There are no gods in Fairy, and most fairy societies lack
formalised religions, instead giving rise to myriad baroque
cosmologies and philosophies of living. One common
conception is of a cosmic library wherein the deeds of
all creatures are recorded in tiny golden books (with
mortal lives as mere footnotes). The deities and powers
worshipped by mortals only concern themselves with
the mortal world and its natives. They have no spiritual
connection with fairies.

Mindset
Fairies are wracked with passions that run deeper than
mortals can fathom. They can be at once wise beyond
measure and petty as children, with an unwavering devotion to their own personal whims. In Fairy, great kingdoms and hierarchies of nobility constrain the most fiery
impulses, but those fairies who come to Dolmenwood tend
to be individualists of bold and adventurous spirit.

Fairy Adventurers in the Mortal World
Fairy PCs have chosen to come to the mortal world without a direct means of return to Fairy. Players should
consider their reason for departure when creating fairy
characters. For example, the character may be in exile,
fleeing some peril, or simply wishing for a new start.

Demi-Fey

Kindreds of Fairy origin that have forsaken their native
world and taken up (more or less) permanent residence
in the mortal world. Over many generations, exposure to
time in the mortal world has changed demi-fey Kindreds
such that they are no longer true fairies.
Playable Kindreds: Woodgrues.

Gradual Mortality
Demi-fey no longer possess the immortality of their forebears, ageing and dying akin to mortals. Their life spans,
however, are long, commonly stretching into a fourth
century. Likewise, demi-fey are susceptible to the diseases
of the mortal world.

Remnants of Innate Magic
Most demi-fey retain some aspects of the innate magic of
their fairy ancestors, but usually diminished by long exposure to the mortal world or transformed into semi-innate
magical traditions passed down over generations.

Religion and Worldview
Like fairies, demi-fey have no spiritual connection with
the deities and powers of mortal religions. They tend to be
superstitious, rather than religious, each folk having accumulated a body of odd beliefs and lore since their arrival
in the mortal world.

Mindset
Similarly to mortals, demi-fey tend to be social creatures,
though they rarely gather in large settlements. Demi-fey
cultures often evolve from the idiosyncratic beliefs and
habits of a handful of esteemed fairy ancestors.

T

he proud and stubborn breggles—sometimes
called goatfolk (or hregl, in their own tongues)—
have inhabited the High Wold since antiquity.
Once the sole masters of that fertile region of hills, meadows, and tangled woods, the ancient breggle noble houses
now rule alongside humans, swearing fealty to the Dukes
of Brackenwold. Breggles live much as humans do, dwelling in hamlets, farmsteads, and castles. In the larger towns
of the High Wold, breggles live side by side with humans.

Shorthorns and Longhorns
Breggles divide themselves into two castes, differentiated
by horn length: shorthorns (the working class) and longhorns (the noble class). Despite this division, shorthorns
and longhorns are in fact the same species. The horns of a
shorthorn who earns wealth and renown will grow, eventually reaching longhorn proportions (4″ or more). True
acceptance in the ruling class is, however, another matter.

Intermarriage With Humans
Humans and breggles occasionally marry and have children. Socially, characters of half-breggle, half-human
parentage are seen as belonging to both Kindreds. They
tend to take strongly after one of their parents and, for
mechanical purposes, should be treated as either human
or breggle.

Crookhorns
Among the armies of the wicked Nag-Lord are a multitude of corrupted breggles known as crookhorns, twisted
in mind and body by the evil magic of their master. The
breggles of the High Wold regard crookhorns as wretched
abominations, to be eradicated at any opportunity.

Religion and Ancestor Worship
As subjects of the duke, breggles are nominally adherents of the Pluritine Church. True devotion to the Church
is, however, rare among breggles, who prefer to offer up
prayers to esteemed ancestors from their long history—see
Aud frengd Hlerr, p179.

32

Kindred Relations

Breggles are on friendly terms with mortal and demi-fey
Kindreds. Most non-adventuring breggles have never met
a fairy and regard them with awe, wonder, and caution.
Breggle folklore is filled with tales of the ancient nobility
of fairies, as well as their tricksome magic.
In human settlements within the High Wold, breggles are
a commonplace sight, many living alongside humans.
Further afield, humans tend to treat them with respect
and caution, as the power of the longhorn noble houses is
known and feared.

Names

A small number of breggle surnames are shared by humans
native to the High Wold, the two Kindreds having lived side
by side for many centuries.

surname from the table below, roll for each, or invent
something in a similar vein.

Extra Details

The tables on the following pages may be used to add extra
details to breggle Player Characters. Roll on as many tables
as desired, or use them as inspiration for crafting additional character details.

P a r t T h r e e | K i n d r e ds

Choosing a Class

Breggle adventurers are most commonly fighters, knights,
or magicians. They seldom seek membership of the Pluritine Church as clerics or friars, and only rare individuals have enough of a connection with Fairy to become
enchanters.

Fur

A breggle character’s thick, woolly fur grants them +1 AC
when unarmoured or wearing Light armour.

Gaze

Upon attaining longhorn status (from Level 4), a breggle
character can use their gaze to charm humans and shorthorns into obeisance.

Horns

Breggles may make a melee attack with their horns instead
of a weapon. The damage inflicted increases with Level, as
indicated in the Breggle Advancement table.

Horn Length and Social Standing
A breggle character begins play as a commoner of the
shorthorn caste, aspiring to improve their lot in life. As
they advance in Level, gaining experience, wealth, and
renown, their horns grow (see the Breggle Advancement
table).

Longhorn Status
Upon reaching Level 4, a breggle character’s horns have
grown to the point that the character is recognised as a
longhorn.

Activating: The longhorn must gaze intently at an individual human or shorthorn.
Effect: If the target fails a Save Versus Spell, they are
charmed to view the longhorn character with awe and
respect. While charmed, the target is unable to harm the
longhorn, either directly or indirectly.
Duration: Until next sunrise.
Resisting: The holy spell Mantle of Protection counters a
longhorn’s gaze.
Usage frequency: A longhorn may use their gaze a limited
number of times per day, depending on their Level—see
the Breggle Advancement table. The gaze may be used on
a specific subject at most once a day.

A

s humans dominate the mortal world with their
cities and kingdoms, elves do so Fairy. Among all
the myriad peoples of the undying world, elves
are driven to forge vast kingdoms, to subjugate others
under their rule, and to delve deeply into the secrets of
magic. Among their number are mighty lords and fearsome enchantresses, ageless sages and dashing knights,
lowly rogues and hapless wanderers.

Appear Human-Like But Otherworldly
Elves are physically similar to humans but vary widely
in appearance, with features such as pointed ears, small
horns, or star-shaped pupils marking them as non-human.
It is always possible to identify an elf for they carry an air
of unearthliness about them (unless disguised by magic).

Elves of Many Kinds
In the boundless reaches of Fairy and its countless kingdoms, many kinds of elves are found: the pale elves of the
lightless realms, the dark-skinned, crystal-rimed elves of
the cloud palaces, the cold-hearted frost elves who serve
the wicked Cold Prince, and countless others.

Affairs With Humans
While elves rarely settle permanently in the mortal world,
they occasionally have affairs and trysts with humans. The
children of such pairings are seen as belonging to both
human and elf Kindreds. They tend to take strongly after
one of their parents and, for mechanical purposes, should
be treated as either human or elf.

Kindred Relations

The adventuresome elves who wander in the mortal world
tend to be fascinated with mortal Kindreds, their short,
spirited lifespans, and their inevitable ageing and death.
Some elves view mortal company as peculiar and entertaining, while others earnestly seek to comprehend the
mortal mindset. Elves tend to be on good terms with demifey and other fairies.
In Dolmenwood’s human settlements, elves may be met
with awe and caution. Most everyday humans have never
met a fairy of any kind, and their folklore is stuffed with
tales of the wickedness and treachery of elves in ancient
times, when the Cold Prince ruled all of Dolmenwood.

36

Names

Elves enjoy being addressed by curious epithets hinting
at their names in the tongues of Fairy (which they never
reveal to mortals). Epithets are broadly divided into rustic
and courtly, depending on the elf’s origin or the persona
they choose to present.
Nicknames: Elves who frequent Dolmenwood sometimes
take on a nickname (for example, a shortened version of
their epithet) or a mortal name, for convenience.
Naming a character: Either choose a name from the table
below, roll for a name, or invent something in a similar
vein.

Extra Details

The tables on the following pages may be used to add extra
details to elf Player Characters. Roll on as many of these
tables as desired, or use them as inspiration for crafting
additional character details.

P a r t T h r e e | K i n d r e ds

Choosing a Class

Elf adventurers are commonly enchanters, fighters, hunters, or magicians. It is rare for an elf to be accepted into the
ranks of Dolmenwood nobility as a knight. Elves cannot be
clerics or friars as they have no spiritual connection with
the deities of mortals.

Magic Resistance

As beings of Fairy, where magic is in the very fabric of
things, elves are highly resistant to magic. They gain +2
Magic Resistance (see Magic Resistance, p17).

Unearthly Beauty

Elves have a Skill Target of 5 for Listen and Search.

Elves—both benevolent and wicked—are beautiful by
mortal standards. When interacting with mortals, an elf
gains a +2 bonus to Charisma (to a maximum of 18).

Glamours

Vulnerable to Cold iron

Elf Skills

Elves possess minor magical talents known as glamours
(see p94). Each elf knows a single, randomly determined
glamour.

As fairies, cold iron weapons inflict +1 damage on elves.
(e.g. a cold iron shortsword would inflict 1d6+1 damage on
an elf, rather than the standard 1d6).

Immortality

Elves can be killed but do not die naturally. They are
immune to diseases of non-magical origin. Elves also
cannot die of thirst or starvation, though a lack of sustenance drives them desperate and sadistic (see p153).

rimalkins are shape-shifting cat-fairies renowned
for their magic of illusion and their love of eating
rats. They can take on three different forms,
described below. Grimalkins originate in the fairy realm of
Catland, ruled over by the fearsome Queen Abyssinia—the
Queen of All Cats. Those grimalkins who enter Dolmenwood live as wanderers and adventurers.

Cunning Humanoid Form—Estray
A grimalkin’s normal form is that of a humanoid cat, wearing clothing, speaking, and walking upright. A grimalkin
in estray is, by all appearances, a humanoid cat, beautiful
or ugly, with fur covering their little body.

Fat Moggy Form—Chester
In chester, a grimalkin resembles a normal cat in all
respects—though perhaps fatter than the average mouser.
A grimalkin in chester can understand language, but can
only respond in wordless yowls and meows.

Fey Predator Form—Wilder
The primal, fey form of a grimalkin. A grimalkin in wilder
is difficult to perceive clearly in the mortal world as more
than a gleaming pair of deranged, predatory eyes beyond
the throw of the lantern’s light.

Kindred Relations

The adventuresome grimalkins who wander in the mortal
world tend to become jealous and furtive among their own
kind, so they prefer the company of other Kindreds. They
enjoy the companionship of other fairies and demi-fey,
holding a special fondness for the frivolity of woodgrues.
They regard the earnest undertakings of humans and other
mortal Kindreds as comical and somewhat absurd.
Grimalkins are greeted with curiosity and wonder in
human settlements in Dolmenwood, perhaps due to
humans’ affection for domestic cats.

Names

Grimalkin names tend to be non-gendered. Exceptions
(and titles) are listed in the table with male/female variants. It is uncertain whether grimalkins choose such
cutesy, whimsical names in earnest or whether they are
mocking mortals by forcing them to utter such drivel. It is
also not known whether the noble titles claimed by some
grimalkins have any truth behind them (though, of course,
the bearers of such titles swear to their authenticity).
Naming a character: Either choose a first name and
surname from the table below, roll for each, or invent
something in a similar vein.

Extra Details

The tables on the following pages may be used to add extra
details to grimalkin Player Characters. Roll on as many
of these tables as desired, or use them as inspiration for
crafting additional character details.

P a r t T h r e e | K i n d r e ds

Choosing a Class

Grimalkin adventurers are commonly bards, enchanters, hunters, or thieves. It is rare for a grimalkin to be
accepted into the ranks of Dolmenwood nobility as a
knight. Grimalkins cannot be clerics or friars as they have
no spiritual connection with the deities of mortals.

Armour and Weapons

Armour must be tailored to grimalkins’ small size. Likewise, grimalkins cannot wield Large weapons (see p118).

Defensive Bonus

In melee with Large creatures, grimalkins gain a +2 Armour
Class bonus, due to their small size.

Eating Giant Rodents

After spending 1 Turn devouring a freshly killed giant
rodent, a grimalkin heals 1 Hit Point.

Glamours

Grimalkins possess minor magical talents known as glamours (see p94). Each grimalkin knows a single, randomly
determined glamour.

Grimalkin Skills

Grimalkins have a Skill Target of 5 for Listen.

Immortality

Grimalkins can be killed but do not die naturally. They are
immune to diseases of non-magical origin. Grimalkins
also cannot die of thirst or starvation, though a lack of
sustenance drives them desperate and sadistic (see p153).

Magic Resistance

As beings of Fairy, where magic is in the very fabric of
things, grimalkins are highly resistant to magic. They gain
+2 Magic Resistance (see Magic Resistance, p17).

Shape-Shifting

A grimalkin can spend 1 Round to transform into either
a fat domestic cat (chester) or a primal fey form (wilder).
Capabilities: When transformed, a grimalkin cannot use
weapons, magic (e.g. glamours or spells), or any special
Class capabilities (e.g. thief skills).
Equipment: All gear carried is optionally transformed with
the character, reappearing when they return to humanoid
form.

Chester (Unlimited Usage)
Combat: The character has Armour Class 12, Speed 30, and
may make a bite and two claw attacks each Round. Each
attack inflicts 1 point of damage.
Speech: The character can understand language, but can
only respond in wordless yowls and meows.
Changing back: Takes 1 Round. Only possible when the
grimalkin is unobserved by any other sentient being.

Wilder (Once a Day)
Entering wilder: A grimalkin may only transform into
wilder when in melee and at less than half of their maximum Hit Points. On entering wilder, the character heals
2d6 Hit Points.
Near-invisible: Only the grimalkin’s deranged eyes are
visible. Opponents who cannot see the invisible suffer a –2
penalty to Attack Rolls against the grimalkin. Those who
can see the invisible discern a bulky feline form, 3′ high,
with a leering grin and fur standing electrified on end.
Combat: The character has Armour Class 13, Speed 30, and
may make a bite and two claw attacks each Round, with a
+2 bonus to Attack Rolls. Each attack inflicts 1d4 damage.
Fey chaos: The grimalkin cannot distinguish friend from
foe, indiscriminately attacking the nearest creature.
After 2d4 Rounds: The grimalkin instantly returns to their
humanoid (estray) form.

Vulnerable to Cold iron

As fairies, cold iron weapons inflict +1 damage on
grimalkins. (e.g. a cold iron shortsword would inflict 1d6+1
damage on a grimalkin, rather than the standard 1d6).

A

s is the way in the wider world beyond the forest,
humans prevail within the settled reaches of
Dolmenwood. Possessed of a restless and curious
spirit, humans venture into unexplored regions, found
great dominions, and delve into perilous secrets of magic.

Hamlets, Towns, and Cities
Human settlements are found throughout Dolmenwood,
from the isolated hamlets of hunters and woodcutters,
to welcoming wayside inns, to trade villages and market
towns, to the great city of Castle Brackenwold.

Folklore and Faith
While most everyday humans in Dolmenwood are adherents of the Pluritine Church (p178), whispers of the worship
of the old gods live on in folklore. The local belief in mead
and ale as a means of communion with greater powers
hearkens back to worship of the Green Man—god of feast,
ale, revelry, and hunting. Indeed, the Green Man’s leafringed visage can still be spied on old buildings and gravestones throughout Dolmenwood. See Gwyrae, p179.

Humans of Many Kinds
In the wide expanse of the mortal world, humans are the
most populous Kindred, spread throughout many cultures
and lands. Merchants and wanderers travel far and wide,
bringing trade and rumour to Dolmenwood from distant
cultures.

Intermarriage With Breggles
Humans and breggles occasionally marry and have children. See Intermarriage With Humans, p32.

Affairs With Elves
Wandering elves occasionally tryst with humans, sometimes conceiving children. See Affairs With Humans,
p36.

44

Kindred Relations

Humans are on friendly terms with mortal and demi-fey
Kindreds and live alongside breggles in the High Wold
region. Most non-adventuring humans have never met
a fairy and regard them with awe and caution. Human
folklore is rife with tales of the treachery and mischief of
fairies, not least the wicked Cold Prince and his servants,
who ruled Dolmenwood in ancient times.

Names

The names listed are typical of the everyday folk in
Dolmenwood and its surrounds. Such common names
are not used by nobility or perilous folk such as the Drune.

surname from the table below, roll for each, or invent

Choosing a Class

Humans are commonly found in all Classes except
enchanter. Rare is the human with enough connection to
Fairy to become an enchanter.

Decisiveness

When an Initiative Roll is tied, humans act first, as if they
had won initiative. Treat humans as a separate side, acting
before others. See Initiative, p165.

Leadership

The Loyalty rating of retainers in the employ of a human
character is increased by 1. See Retainers, p134.

Spirited

Humans are quick to learn and adapt and gain a +10%
bonus to all Experience Points earned. This is in addition to
any XP bonus due to the character’s Prime Ability (p22).
For example, a human with a Prime Ability of 15 gains a
total 15% XP bonus—5% for the Prime Ability and 10% for
their Kindred.

M

osslings are an obscure, stunted folk native
to Dolmenwood, with an affinity for the dank
plants and moulds of the deep woods. They are
of stocky, pudgy build, with green, yellow, or brown skin,
textured like wrinkled bark and patched with mould,
lichen, fungus, and creeping plants. Their hair and beards
are green or black and plant-like, akin to moss, ferns, or
tangled roots. If injured, mosslings ooze white, sap-like
blood.

Ageing, Death, and Composting
Mosslings become wiser and more plant-like as they
age. After death, even their bones rot away to mould: a
mossling’s body decays to a rich compost within a year.

Dank Forest Burrows
The natural habitat of mosslings is dark, dank forests,
where they gather in small, isolated communities. They
are, above all, burrowers, delving their homes into the
damp earth of the Wood or inhabiting natural caves where
they are found.

Worship Gods of Moss and Fungus
As subjects of the Duke of Brackenwold, mosslings are
nominally adherents of the Pluritine Church. However, in
practice they worship their own gods of the deep forest and
the fecund underworld—see Mogba, p179.

Kindred Relations

Mosslings are on friendly terms with mortal and demi-fey
Kindreds. While most non-adventuring mosslings have
never met a fairy, they tend to treat fairies with curiosity
as wanderers from afar with tales to share.
Mosslings are welcomed in human settlements in Dolmenwood, where they sometimes travel to sell mushrooms, ale,
or cheese at a market.

Names

Among their own folk, mosslings tend not to use surnames.
If pressed by folk of other Kindreds, they usually adopt a
mélange of Woldish words associated with their culture.
Naming a character: Either choose a first name and
surname from the table below, roll for each, or invent
something in a similar vein.

Extra Details

The tables on the following pages may be used to add extra
details to mossling Player Characters. Roll on as many of
these tables as desired, or use them as inspiration for crafting additional character details.

P a r t T h r e e | K i n d r e ds

Choosing a Class

Mossling adventurers are commonly fighters and hunters. They are only occasionally accepted into the ranks of
Dolmenwood nobility as knights, seldom seek membership of the Pluritine Church as clerics or friars, and rarely
possess enough connection with Fairy to become enchanters.

Armour and Weapons

Armour must be tailored to mosslings’ small size. Likewise, mosslings cannot wield Large weapons (see p118).
Mosslings prefer non-metal armour, and manufacture
special suits of armour from hardened bark and pinecones.
Rolled armour: If a player rolls chainmail when creating a
mossling character, it should be replaced with bark armour.
Plate mail should be replaced with pinecone armour.

Knacks

Mosslings practice carefully guarded, quasi-magical crafts
known as knacks. Each mossling knows one knack, rolled or
chosen at character creation. See Mossling Knacks, p112.

Mossling Skills

Mosslings have a Skill Target of 5 for Survival when foraging.

Resilience

Mosslings are hardy and resilient like the gnarled bole of
an old tree. They gain a +4 bonus to Saving Throws against
fungal spores or poisons and a +2 to bonus to all other
Saving Throws.

Symbiotic Flesh

As a mossling ages, their dank, fertile flesh picks up seeds
and spores which germinate into symbiotic plants and
fungi. At each Level (including Level 1), the character
acquires a random trait from the Symbiotic Flesh table.
Duplicates may be re-rolled or taken to indicate an amplification of the trait.

W

oodgrues are capricious, bat-faced goblins who,
many generations ago, forsook their ancestral
home in Fairy and migrated to the musty dells
of the mortal world. They have massive, flapping ears and
soft, downy fur upon their heads and chests, while the rest
of their body appears like that of a human child.

Woodland Wanderers
Woodgrues live a nomadic lifestyle, wandering Dolmenwood alone or in small groups, following where their
whims and noses lead. They are happy to camp in the wild,
erecting miniature shelters high in trees, but also enjoy the
comforts of human settlements.

Enchanted Songs
Woodgrues love wild dancing and cacophonous music—
primarily crazed nighttime warbling played on pipes.
The magic of Fairy lingers in the music of woodgrues, for
their songs can lure folk into the deep woods and enchant
them to frolic. Woodgrues delight in using this magic for
mischief and high jinks. While mischievous and rascally,
woodgrues only cause serious harm if slighted.

Seasonal Moots
Several times a year (the exact timing varies), a woodgrue
elder calls a moot. The invitation arrives through the night
air via a cacophony of hoots and pipes, announcing the
festivities at an appointed place and time. Moots typically
last for five days and are attended by up to two hundred
woodgrues, dancing, celebrating, and sharing news.

Kindred Relations

Woodgrues enjoy the company of all Kindreds, mortal,
fairy, or demi-fey, though they favour those who share
their raucous sense of humour.
In human settlements in Dolmenwood, woodgrues may be
met with caution, as folk are aware of their rambunctious
nature. However, it is known that barring woodgrues entry
would likely only lead to greater misfortune.

details to woodgrue Player Characters. Roll on as many
of these tables as desired, or use them as inspiration for
crafting additional character details.

P a r t T h r e e | K i n d r e ds

Choosing a Class

Woodgrue adventurers are commonly bards, magicians,
or thieves. It is rare for a woodgrue to be accepted into the
ranks of Dolmenwood nobility as a knight. Woodgrues
cannot be clerics or friars as they have no spiritual connection with the deities of mortals.

Armour and Weapons

Armour must be tailored to woodgrues’ small size. Likewise, woodgrues cannot wield Large weapons (see p118).

Compulsive Jubilation

A woodgrue who witnesses a party, feast, celebration, or
festival must partake; they are utterly compelled with
every fibre of their being. If, for some reason, a woodgrue
wishes to resist this compulsion, they may Save Versus
Spell (but feel drained and downtrodden for the length of
the engagement).

Revel: Subjects cannot speak; instead they bark out terrible
scats of sound, in an attempt to keep up with the woodgrue’s maddening melodies. Speed is halved if subjects are
not headed in the direction of the woodgrue.

Moon Sight

A woodgrue can see in darkness up to 60′, viewing the
world as though it glows in faint moonlight. This does
not incur low light penalties (p150), but fine detail (e.g.
writing) cannot be perceived.

Musical Instruments

A woodgrue can employ a musical instrument as a melee
weapon, doing 1d4 damage.

Starting Equipment

Woodgrues begin play with a wind instrument.

Defensive bonus

Vulnerable to Cold iron

In melee with Large creatures, woodgrues gain a +2 Armour
Class bonus, due to their small size.

As demi-fey, cold iron weapons inflict +1 damage on woodgrues. (e.g. a cold iron shortsword would inflict 1d6+1
damage on a woodgrue, rather than the standard 1d6).

Mad Revelry

Woodgrue Skills

Once per day, a woodgrue may play one of the enchanted
melodies listed below on a wind instrument while hooting
and dancing terribly.

Woodgrues have a Skill Target of 5 for Listen.

Subjects: All living creatures within 30′ (including allies)
must Save Versus Spell or be afflicted by the melody. Fairies and demi-fey gain a +2 bonus to the Saving Throw.
Duration: The effects of the melody last as long as the
woodgrue keeps playing. While playing, the woodgrue
may move but cannot attack or perform other actions.
Disrupting: If the woodgrue is harmed or fails a Saving
Throw, they stop playing. Subjects who are harmed or fail
a Saving Throw likewise cease to be affected.

Enchanted Melodies
Confide: Subjects speak in a slurred voice, confessing some
deeply hidden emotion or revealing an ally’s secret.
Dance: Subjects begin dancing a profane, nonsensical jig.
Those affected gain a +1 bonus to Armour Class, but cannot
move from the spot where they dance.
Imbibe: Subjects ravenously consume any liquids (potable
or not), herbs, mushrooms, and such like that are available
and proceed to act as though drunk, suffering a –2 penalty
to Attack Rolls until the revelry ends.
Jape: Subjects mock the immediately preceding occurrence, be it a deed of words or acts.
Jubilate: Subjects burst into irrepressible laughter, preventing them from speech. There is a 1-in-6 chance each Round
of falling over in a laughing fit.
Mount: Subjects attempt to mount nearby creatures, be
they friend or foe, and ride them piggyback (Save Versus
Hold to resist being mounted). Unaffected creatures may
Save Versus Hold once per Round to buck off a rider.

’ve worked with ‘em all. Fighters, knights, and
sword-twirling warriors of all kinds. Hunters, thieves,
and those who skulk for a living. Bards and enchanters, with their charms and glamours and silver tongues. Clerics,
and friars, with a handy prayer or two. Even other magicians—
though they tend to get a bit jealous of my skills with a wand.
In any case, folks of all different adventuring professions are
useful to have around when you’re in a pinch. My advice? Just
make sure you can drink ‘em under the table when it comes
time to divvy up the loot.”

W

orldly and well-travelled, bards are storehouses of folklore and hearsay. Their music
and songs are woven with magic, which can
both protect and beguile.

Starting Equipment

Counter Charm

While the bard plays music and sings, allies within 30′ are
immune to magical effects based on music or song and
gain a +2 bonus to Saving Throws against fairy magic.
Restrictions: A bard can use counter charm once per Turn.
While playing, the bard may move at half Speed, but cannot
attack or perform other actions.
Duration: The counter charm lasts as long as the bard
keeps playing.
Disrupting: If the bard is harmed or fails a Saving Throw,
the counter charm ends.

Armour (roll 1d6): 1–2. None. 3–4. Leather armour. 5–6.
Chainmail.

BARD SKILL TARGETS

Weapons (roll 1d6 twice): 1. Club. 2. 3 daggers. 3. Longsword.
4. Sling + 20 stones. 5. Shortbow + 20 arrows. 6. Shortsword.

Decipher LegerdeDoc.
main

Class items: Musical instrument (stringed or wind).

Bard Skills

As they advance in Level, bards improve their chance of
success with the Listen skill. They also have three additional, specialised skills. The Bard Skill Targets table lists
the character’s Skill Targets as they advance in Level.

Decipher Document
A successful check allows a bard to understand the gist of a
non-magical text in a language they do not speak, unravel
a cypher, or identify cryptically labelled landmarks on a
map.
Retrying: The bard may only attempt to read the same
document again after gaining a Level.

Customising Bard Skills (Optional Rule)

A successful check allows a bard to perform a trick of
sleight of hand, such as palming a small object, slipping a
poison into a drink, or pilfering a small item in the possession of another creature.

The Bard Skill Targets table lists the standard skill
progression, granting a balanced advancement across
all skills. Players wishing to customise their character’s
skill advancement may use this optional rule.

Difficulty: –1 penalty per 3 Levels of the victim or observer
(e.g. a Level 6 target incurs a –2 penalty).

Base Skill Target: All skills begin at 6.

Natural 1: On a roll of natural 1, the bard must Save Versus
Doom to avoid being noticed. The Referee determines the
victim’s reaction.

Monster Lore
A successful check allows a bard to identify monsters
and their basic powers and vulnerabilities, based on their
appearances in myth and folklore.
Retrying: The bard may only attempt to identify the same
kind of monster again after gaining a Level.

58

Expertise points: Bards gain expertise points to
improve their skills. Each point allocated to a skill
lowers the Skill Target by 1.
At Level 1: At character creation, the player may allocate
2 expertise points.
Gaining Levels: At each Level gained, the player may
allocate 1 expertise point.
Minimum Skill Target: No Skill Target may be lowered
below 2.

Fascinated Subjects

By playing music and singing, the bard can fascinate
subjects in a 30′ radius.

Rapt: Fascinated subjects’ attention is fully bent on the
bard’s performance.

Restrictions: A bard may use enchantment once a day per
Level, and it cannot be used in combat. While playing, the
bard may move at half Speed, but cannot attack or perform
other actions.

Interruptions: If the performance is interrupted (e.g. by
loud noise or violence), the fascination ends immediately.

Follow: If the bard walks while playing, fascinated subjects
follow.

Selecting subjects: One or more creatures whose Levels
total up to twice the bard’s Level can be affected. If a group
is targeted, the Referee selects the subjects randomly,
summing their Levels until the maximum is reached.

Duration: The fascination lasts for as long as the bard’s
performance continues. Afterwards, fascinated subjects
may come under a stronger charm (see When the Performance Ends).

Types of subjects: At Level 1, the bard can affect mortals.
From Level 4, animals and demi-fey can also be affected.
From Level 7, fairies and monstrosities can also be affected.

When the Performance Ends

Resisting: Each subject must Save Versus Spell or be fascinated (see Fascinated Subjects).

If the performance lasted for at least 1 Turn and ended
without interruption, each fascinated subject must make
another Save Versus Spell (with a +2 bonus) or be charmed
as follows.
Friendship: Charmed subjects regard the bard as a trusted
friend and ally, coming to the bard’s defence.
Commands: If they share a language, charmed subjects
obey the bard’s commands.
Resisting commands: The subject may resist commands
that contradict their habits or Alignment. Suicidal or
clearly harmful commands are always refused.
Duration: 1 Turn per Level of the bard.

C

lerics are members of an order of holy warriors
sworn to the service of the Pluritine Church. They
are organised in a strict religious hierarchy, under
the command of higher-ranking Church officials. Player
Character clerics are typically granted a writ of self-determination, allowing them to roam freely and carry out the
will of God as they see fit.

Restrictions
Alignment: As servants of the Church, clerics must be
Lawful or Neutral.
Falling from grace: Clerics must be faithful to the tenets
of their order (see Cleric Tenets). A cleric who transgresses
or becomes Chaotic falls from grace and loses the ability
to pray for spells. The Referee may allow the character to
perform a quest of atonement in order to regain favour.
Kindred: Only mortals are trained as clerics—fairies and
demi-fey have no spiritual connection with the deities of
mortals.
Magic armaments: Clerics are forbidden to use magic
weapons, armour, and shields of arcane or fairy origin.
They may only use holy magic armaments.

Cleric Tenets
See p178 for more details on the Pluritine Church.
Evangelism: Non-believers are to be brought into the
fold and converted.
Hierarchy: The hierarchy of the Church is to be upheld.
Those of lesser rank must obey their superiors.
Monotheism: Only One True God exists, and His name
is ineffable. Other religions worship personifications of
divine aspects of God or the anointed saints.
Sanctity of life: Sentient life is sacred. Clerics must
protect the innocent with all means available.

Holy Magic

See Holy Magic, p100 for full details on holy magic,
including praying for spells and the list of spells that clerics can cast.
Holy symbol: A cleric must carry a holy symbol (p117).
Spell casting: Once a cleric has proven their devotion (from
Level 2), the character may pray to the host of saints to
receive their blessings in the form of holy spells. The Cleric
Spells Per Day table shows the number of spells a cleric may
receive, determined by the character’s Level. For example,
a Level 3 cleric may have the blessing to cast at most two
Rank 1 spells.
Using magic items: Clerics can use magic items exclusive
to holy spell-casters (for example, magic rods or scrolls of
holy spells).

A cleric can detect whether an item is enchanted with holy
magic.
Requirements: The cleric must touch the object and
concentrate without distraction.

Holy Order

Upon reaching Level 2, a cleric is initiated into one of the
following holy orders, selected by the player. Clerics of
each order gain a special power and bear the order’s holy
symbol.

The Order of St Faxis
The order of seekers; clerics who follow an edict to root out
practitioners of dark magic—those who truck with devils
or deal in necromancy.
Arcane antipathy: A cleric of St Faxis gains a +2 bonus to
Saving Throws against arcane magic. Arcane spell-casters
suffer a –2 penalty to Saving Throws against spells cast by
a cleric of St Faxis.
Holy symbol: Three crossed swords.

The Order of St Sedge
The defenders of the Church; clerics who protect the lands
of the Church from invaders.
Laying on hands: A cleric of St Sedge can heal by laying
their hands on wounded characters. Once a day, the cleric
can heal a total of up to 1 Hit Point per Level.
Holy symbol: A hand with two fingers raised.

The Order of St Signis
The order of Lichwards; clerics who watch over the dead
and hunt those which rise again as undead.
Undead slayer: A cleric of St Signis gains a +1 Attack bonus
against undead monsters. Their attacks harm undead
monsters that can normally only be harmed by magical
or silver weapons, even when not wielding a weapon of
the appropriate type.
Holy symbol: A human skull crowned with ivy.

Turning the Undead

A cleric may attempt to drive off undead monsters by
presenting their holy symbol and invoking the might of
the One True God.
Range: The undead must be within 30′. Concealed undead
(e.g. behind doors or in coffers) are unaffected.
Turning roll: When a cleric attempts to turn the undead,
roll 2d6 to determine the result (modifiers listed below):
▶ 4 or lower: The undead are unaffected.
▶ 5–6: 2d4 undead are stunned for 1 Round, unable to act.
▶ 7–12: 2d4 undead flee from the cleric for 1 Turn.
▶ 13 or higher: 2d4 undead are permanently destroyed.
Lower Level undead: If the undead are lower Level than the
cleric, the turning roll is modified by +2 per Level difference
(maximum +6). For example, a Level 5 cleric turning Level
3 undead would gain a +4 bonus.
Higher Level undead: If the undead are higher Level than
the cleric, the turning roll is modified by –2 per Level difference (maximum –6). For example, a Level 3 cleric turning
Level 6 undead would suffer a –6 penalty.
Mixed groups: In encounters with multiple types of
undead, those of lowest Level are affected first. On a
successful turning roll, the cleric may make another roll
the following Round, affecting the next lowest Level type
of undead present. This process may be repeated until all
types of undead have been affected or a turning roll fails.
Usage frequency: One attempt per Turn.

Cleric Holy Symbols
Clerics in Dolmenwood usually carry a Chapes (p178),
a pendant with an effigy of St Clewyd (holding the rod
of mercy and quill of justice), or the symbol of their
Holy Order.

In addition to their native languages, clerics speak Liturgic,
the language of Church scripture.

ndividuals whose contact with Fairy has imbued
them with innate magic known as glamours.
Enchanters are also blessed with the use of the
fairy runes, guarded by the lords of Fairy, though such gifts
are not always without cost.

Restrictions
Kindred: Typically only fairies and demi-fey (elves,
grimalkins, and woodgrues) are enchanters. Occasionally a mortal with a strong connection to Fairy may also
be an enchanter—for example, a human with mixed elfish
ancestry, an individual kidnapped by fairies in childhood,
or someone who wandered lost in Fairy for many years.

Starting Equipment
Armour (roll 1d6): 1–2. None. 3–4. Leather armour. 5–6.
Chainmail.
Weapons (roll 1d6 twice): 1. Club. 2. Dagger. 3. Longsword.
4. Shortbow + 20 arrows. 5. Spear. 6. Staff.

Enchanter Skills

Enchanters have one additional, specialised skill. The
Enchanter Skill Targets table lists the character’s Skill
Targets as they advance in level.

Detect Magic
An enchanter can attempt to detect the subtle resonances
woven into an enchanted object, place, or creature. If the
attempt succeeds, the enchanter knows if the object, place,
or creature in question is magical—i.e. enchanted, affected
by a spell, or possessed of innate magic of some kind.
Requirements: The enchanter must touch the object,
place, or creature to be analysed and concentrate without
distraction.
Time: Each attempt to detect magic requires 1 Turn.
Retrying: The enchanter may retry failed attempts as often
as they wish, each attempt requiring an additional 1 Turn.
Referee rolls: The Referee rolls all Detect Magic Checks,
so that players do not know if the roll failed or if there is
no magic present.
Downtime: Given an hour of solitude in a safe location,
an enchanter automatically detects magic on an object,
place, or creature.

magical sigils guarded by the rulers of Fairy. As a character
advances, fairy nobles may be drawn by the enchanter’s
great deeds and grant new runes. See Fairy Magic, p92
for details on the fairy runes.
At Level 1: An enchanter knows one randomly selected
rune of lesser magnitude.
Subsequent Levels: Each time the character gains a Level,
the player should roll for the chance of acquiring a new
rune. See Learning Runes, p92.

Glamours

Enchanters possess minor magical talents known as glamours (see p94). The number of glamours known is determined by the character’s level as shown in the Enchanter
Advancement table. Known glamours are determined
randomly.
Kindred glamours: Some Kindreds (e.g. elf, grimalkin)
gain glamours as a result of their ancestry. Such glamours
are in addition to glamours gained by this Class. For example, a Level 1 human enchanter knows 1 glamour, whereas
a Level 1 elf enchanter knows 2 glamours—one from their
Kindred and one from their Class.

Magic Items

The enchanter’s natural affinities allow the use of magical
items exclusive to arcane spell-casters (for example, magic
wands or scrolls of arcane spells).

Resistance to Divine Aid

The saints of the Pluritine Church are loath to aid those
allied with the godless world of Fairy. If an enchanter is the
subject of a beneficial holy spell, there is a 2-in-6 chance it
has no effect.

ighters are experienced in combat and warfare,
whether as brigands, tavern brawlers, town

Weapons (roll 1d6 twice): 1. Crossbow + 20 quarrels. 2.
Dagger. 3. Longsword. 4. Mace. 5. Shortsword. 6. Spear.

Combat Talents

Fighters’ expert training grants them special talents to aid
in battle. At Levels 2, 6, 10, and 14 the player should roll or
choose one of the following talents.
1. Battle rage: When in melee, the fighter can choose to
enter a berserk rage that lasts until the end of combat.
While in the rage, the fighter gains a +2 bonus to Attack
and Damage Rolls, but suffers a –4 penalty to Armour
Class and is unable to flee.
2. Cleave: When in melee with multiple foes, if the fighter
strikes a killing blow, they may immediately make
another attack against a second foe. The second Attack
Roll is penalised at –2.
3. Defender: When the fighter is in melee with a foe, any
Attack Rolls the foe makes against characters other than
the fighter are penalised at –2.
4. Last stand: If the fighter is killed by being reduced to
0 Hit Points, they can continue to act for up to 5 additional Rounds before dying. Each time the fighter suffers
further damage during this period, they must Save
Versus Doom or die. Magical healing is effective during
this period, but the fighter must still Save Versus Doom
when damaged, even if healed to above 0 HP.
5. Leader: Mercenaries or retainers under the fighter’s
command and within 60′ gain a +1 bonus to Morale or
Loyalty. All the fighter’s allies within 60′ gain a +2 bonus
to Saving Throws against fear effects.
6. Main gauche: When fighting with a Small melee weapon
(e.g. a dagger or hand axe) in the off hand (in place of
a shield), the fighter may choose each Round to gain
either a +1 Armour Class bonus or a +1 Attack bonus.

64

7. Slayer: The fighter gains a +1 bonus to Attack and
Damage Rolls when in combat with foes of a specific
type. The type of enemy must be chosen when this
talent is selected (examples: bears, crookhorns, undead,
wyrms, etc.). This talent may be chosen multiple times,
each time for a different type of foe.
8. Weapon specialist: The fighter is an expert with a
specific type of weapon chosen by the player (e.g.
maces, two-handed swords, longbows, etc.). They gain
a +1 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls using this type
of weapon. This talent may be chosen multiple times,
each time for a different type of weapon.

Restrictions

Holy magic

riars are monks or nuns who have taken to a life of
wandering, doing good wherever they can. They
are only loosely affiliated with the Church and
exist outside the strict religious hierarchy of the clergy.
Friars are thus beloved by the common folk, whom they
often aid where the Church does not.

Alignment: As servants of the Church, friars must be
Lawful or Neutral.
Falling from grace: Friars must be faithful to the tenets
of their order (see Friar Tenets). A friar who transgresses
or becomes Chaotic falls from grace and loses the ability
to pray for spells. The Referee may allow the character to
perform a quest of atonement in order to regain favour.
Kindred: Only mortals are trained as friars—fairies and
demi-fey have no spiritual connection with the deities of
mortals.

Starting Equipment

In the hands of a friar, a single dose of a medicinal herb
(for example those listed under Common Fungi and Herbs,
p130) is sufficient for 2 subjects.

See Holy Magic, p100 for full details on holy magic,
including praying for spells and the list of spells that friars
can cast.
Holy symbol: A friar must carry a holy symbol (p117).
Spell casting: Friars may pray to the host of saints and
receive blessings in the form of holy spells. The Friar
Spells Per Day table shows the number of spells a friar may
receive, determined by the character’s Level. For example,
a Level 2 friar may cast at most two Rank 1 spells.
Using magic items: Friars can use magic items exclusive
to holy spell-casters (for example, magic rods or scrolls of
holy spells).

Weapon (roll 1d6): 1. Club. 2. Dagger. 3–4. Sling + 20 stones.
5–6. Staff.

FRIAR SPELLS PER DAY

Class items: Friar’s habit, wooden holy symbol.

Armour of Faith

The divine blessing of the One True God grants friars a
bonus to Armour Class, depending on their Level. See the
Friar Advancement table.

Friar Tenets
See p178 for more details on the Pluritine Church.
Sanctity of life: All life is sacred. Friars must protect
and aid the needy with all means available.
Monotheism: Only One True God exists, and His name
is ineffable. Other religions worship personifications of
divine aspects of God or the anointed saints.
Spiritual insight: Each individual must form their own
relationship with God, through study and insight.
Mentorship: Friars must share their wisdom with
common folk and non-believers, guiding them into
the ways of the Pluritine Church.

Languages

Turning the Undead

Poverty

Range: The undead must be within 30′. Concealed undead
(e.g. behind doors or in coffers) are unaffected.

In addition to their native languages, friars speak Liturgic,
the language of Church scripture.

Due to their monastic vows, a friar’s worldly possessions
are limited to that which can be carried on their person or
mount. Excess wealth must be donated to worthy causes
(not other PCs).
Furthermore, a friar must dress in a simple habit and cut
their hair in a traditional tonsure.

A friar may attempt to drive off undead monsters by
presenting their holy symbol and invoking the might of
the One True God.

Turning roll: When a friar attempts to turn the undead,
roll 2d6 to determine the result (modifiers listed below):
▶ 4 or lower: The undead are unaffected.
▶ 5–6: 2d4 undead are stunned for 1 Round, unable to act.
▶ 7–12: 2d4 undead flee from the friar for 1 Turn.
▶ 13 or higher: 2d4 undead are permanently destroyed.
Lower Level undead: If the undead are lower Level than the
friar, the turning roll is modified by +2 per Level difference
(maximum +6). For example, a Level 5 friar turning Level
3 undead would gain a +4 bonus.
Higher Level undead: If the undead are higher Level than
the friar, the turning roll is modified by –2 per Level difference (maximum –6). For example, a Level 3 friar turning
Level 6 undead would suffer a –6 penalty.
Mixed groups: In encounters with multiple types of
undead, those of lowest Level are affected first. On a
successful turning roll, the friar may make another roll
the following Round, affecting the next lowest Level type
of undead present. This process may be repeated until all
types of undead have been affected or a turning roll fails.
Usage frequency: One attempt per Turn.

Friar Holy Symbols
Friars usually carry a pendant with an effigy of a saint
whose deeds inspire their faith. See Holy Magic, p100
for details on the major saints and their areas of patronage.

Establishing a Connection
The hunter must approach the animal and interact in a
peaceful manner for 1 Turn. On a successful Charisma
Check, the animal becomes the hunter’s companion.

Companion’s Behaviour

ardened to a life in the wilds, hunters develop a
keen survival instinct and an intuitive connection with wild animals. A hunter’s knowledge of
tracking, hunting, and survival is invaluable to any party
travelling deep into Dolmenwood.

Once a connection is successfully established, the animal
companion follows the hunter everywhere. It understands
basic commands from the hunter (even if its species would
not normally do so). The companion fights to defend the
hunter, never checking Morale.

Starting Equipment

Hunter Skills

Armour (roll 1d6): 1–3. Leather armour. 4–6. Leather
armour + shield.
Weapons (roll 1d6 twice): 1. Dagger. 2. Longsword. 3–4.
Longbow + 20 arrows (shortbow + 20 arrows for Small characters). 5. Shortsword. 6. Sling + 20 stones.

Animal Companion

A hunter may attempt to forge a bond with an animal. If
the bond is successfully established, the animal becomes
the hunter’s loyal companion.

Requirements
One companion: A hunter may have but a single animal
companion. If a companion dies or is dismissed, the hunter
may attempt to forge a connection with a new animal.
Type of animal: Both wild and domestic animals may
be companions. Giant or magical animals may become a
hunter’s companion at the Referee’s discretion. Sentient
animal species are not suitable.
Level: An animal companion may not exceed the hunter’s
Level.

68

As they advance in Level, hunters improve their chance
of success with the Survival skill. They also have three
additional, specialised skills. The Hunter Skill Targets table
lists the character’s Skill Targets as they advance in Level.

Alertness
If a hunter’s party is surprised, the hunter may make an
Alertness Check to act normally in the Surprise Round.
See Surprise, p164.

Stalking
Hiding: A hunter may make a Stalking Check to remain
undetected when the only cover available is light brush
(see Hiding and Ambushes under Stealth, p154).
Sneaking: If a Surprise Roll indicates that a hunter’s party
has been detected, the hunter may make a Stalking Check
to remain undetected. See Surprise, p164.
Wilderness only: Hunters can only use Stalking in the
wilds (i.e. not in settlements, indoors, or in subterranean
space).

Tracking
A successful check allows a hunter to find tracks left by
creatures in a 30′ × 30′ area. The hunter knows the type of
creatures that made the tracks and may follow the tracks.
Time: An attempt to find tracks takes 1 Turn.
Retrying: The hunter may not attempt to find tracks again
in the same location.
Following tracks: The hunter can follow discovered tracks
until conditions worsen (see Modifiers, below). Another
Tracking Check is then required.
Modifiers: The Referee may specify situational modifiers depending on the conditions, for example: +1 for soft
ground, –1 for hard; +1 for tracks made by a group of 10 or
more creatures; –2 for active attempts to cover tracks; –1
per day since the tracks were made, –1 per hour of rain or
covering snow; –1 for poor lighting.
Wilderness only: Hunters can only use Tracking in the
wilds (i.e. not in settlements, indoors, or in subterranean
space).

The Hunter Skill Targets table lists the standard skill
progression, granting a balanced advancement across
all skills. Players wishing to customise their character’s
skill advancement may use this optional rule.
Base Skill Target: All skills begin at 6.
Expertise points: Hunters gain expertise points to
improve their skills. Each point allocated to a skill
lowers the Skill Target by 1.
At Level 1: At character creation, the player may allocate
2 expertise points.
Gaining Levels: At each Level gained, the player may
allocate 1 expertise point.
Minimum Skill Target: No Skill Target may be lowered
below 2.

Missile Attacks

Hunters gain a +1 Attack bonus with all missile weapons.

Trophies

After hunting down (i.e. tracking, ambushing, or chasing)
and slaying a creature, a hunter may take a trophy from
it—for example, a stag’s antlers, a wyrm’s tooth, etc.
Size: Trophies must be sizeable items (weighing at least
50 coins).
Boon: If a trophy is either on the hunter’s person or
mounted in their home, it acts as a charm: the hunter gains
a +1 bonus to Attack Rolls against other creatures of the
same type and a +1 bonus to Saving Throws against their
special attacks.

Wayfinding

If the Referee determines that the hunter’s party has
become lost, there is a 3-in-6 chance that the hunter can
find the path again.

K

nights are masters of heavily armoured, mounted
combat and, as vassals of a noble house, hold a
special rank in society. Knights earn great respect
from the common folk and exemplify the qualities of
nobility, honour, and decency in all their deeds. Player
Character knights are typically knights-errant—those who
wander the land in pursuit of adventure to prove their
chivalric virtues.

Liege
A knight serves one of the lower noble houses of Dolmenwood (i.e. excluding House Brackenwold, which rules all
of Dolmenwood). The player should roll or choose one of
the houses listed under The Lower Houses of Dolmenwood.
See p176 for more detail on the noble houses.
Disfavour: Knighthood may be revoked if a knight
displeases or dishonours their liege through failure, rebellion, Alignment change, or non-chivalric conduct. In this
case, the character becomes a fighter of equivalent Level.
It may be possible to regain the liege’s favour (and thus
the status of knighthood) by performing a special quest.

Restrictions
Alignment: A knight must have the same Alignment as
their liege.
Kindred: It is uncommon for Kindreds other than humans
and breggles to be trained as knights in the service of the
noble houses of Dolmenwood.
Social class: Knights are often members of the noble
classes, but a person of lowlier origin may be initiated as a
knight as a reward for noble deeds.
Weapons: Knights can use all melee weapons (preferring
the lance) but cannot use missile weapons, which they
regard as dishonourable.
Armour: Knights regard armour as a symbol of prowess
and status, always favouring the most impressive and
impervious-looking armour available. They scorn Light
armour as suitable only for peasants and villains.

Starting Equipment
Armour (roll 1d6): 1. Chainmail. 2–3. Chainmail + shield. 4.
Plate mail. 5–6. Plate mail + shield.
Weapons (roll 1d6 twice): 1. Dagger. 2–4. Lance (spear for
Small characters). 5. Longsword. 6. Mace.

70

Chivalric Code

Knights strive to uphold a stringent code of honour which
binds all decision and deed. See The Code of Chivalry. The
repercussions of performing acts at odds with the code
of chivalry depend on the Alignment of the knight and
their liege.
Lawful or Neutral: The knight brings dishonour upon their
liege, thus risking Disfavour.
Chaotic: The knight is unlikely to bring dishonour upon
their liege, whose reputation is already villainous. Unchivalrous deeds are, however, perceived as besmirching the
institution of knighthood. Other knights hunt the Chaotic
knight and attempt to bring them to justice.

Horsemanship

Assessing steeds: Knights are expert riders and can assess
the worth of any steed. This allows a knight to determine
whether an animal has low, average, or high Hit Points for
its type.
Urging great speed: From Level 5, a knight can urge their
steed to great haste once a day, increasing its Speed by 10
for up to 6 Turns.

Knighthood

Knights of Levels 1–2 are known as squires and are not yet
regarded as true knights. Upon reaching Level 3, the character is knighted by their liege and gains the right to bear
a coat of arms, typically emblazoned upon the knight’s
shield.
Hospitality: Once knighted, the character earns rights of
hospitality and aid from nobles and other knights of the
same Alignment. Hospitality extends to any companions
the knight is willing to vouch for. The knight is expected
to extend such hospitality in kind.

Monster Slayer

From Level 5, a knight gains a +2 bonus to Attack and
Damage Rolls against Large creatures.

Mounted Combat

Knights gain a +1 Attack bonus when mounted.

Strength of Will

Knights gain a +2 bonus to Saving Throws against fairy
magic and effects that cause fear.

The Code of Chivalry
Honour: A knight must behave honourably in all deeds.
A knight’s honour is of utmost importance. Death is
preferable to dishonour.
Service: Service to one’s liege is the greatest honour.
Glory: A knight must seek glory in battle—especially
in single combat.
Protecting the weak: Any person in the knight’s charge
must be defended to the death.
Hierarchy: The hierarchy that binds society is to be
upheld. Superiors must be honoured, equals respected,
inferiors commanded, and the ignoble scorned.

1. House Guillefer (Neutral): Dreamy
and aloof. Rulership shared between
family members on a rotating basis—
currently Lord Edwin Guillefer.

2. House Mulbreck (Lawful): Reclusive
and detached. Under the rulership of
Lady Pulsephine Mulbreck.

6. House Harrowmoor (Lawful): Steadfast and militant. Under the rulership

7. House Hogwarsh (Neutral): Lax and
debauched. Under the rulership of
Baron Sagewine Hogwarsh.

8. House Nodlock (Neutral): Bombastic
and decaying. Under the rulership of

agicians—sometimes called wizards or sorcerers—hone innate sparks of magical sensitivity
through years of arduous study. Magicians are
arcane generalists, accumulating secret lore from any
source they can get their hands on—magic of illusion,
crystalmancy, elementalism, conjuration, and sometimes
even stolen Drune spells. Their accumulation of knowledge allows magicians to cast spells and to wield powerful
magic items. Magicians begin play able to cast just a single
spell each day, but gain access to extremely potent magic
as they advance.

Starting Equipment
Weapon (roll 1d6): 1–3. Dagger. 4–6. Staff.
Class items: Ritual robes. A Level 1 magician starts play
with a single spell book and has learned to cast the spells
contained within. The player should roll or choose one of
the books listed under Starting Spell Books.

72

Starting Spell Books
A Level 1 magician possesses a single spell book and
has learned to cast the spells it describes. A magician’s
first spell book may be an item inherited from a mysterious ancestor, stolen from a cruel master, or meticulously copied under the tutelage of a mentor. The player
should roll or choose one of the following books.
1. Charms of the Fey Court: Contains the following
Rank 1 spells: Fairy Servant, Ingratiate, Ventriloquism.
2. Hogbrand’s Incandescence: Contains the following
Rank 1 spells: Firelight, Ignite / Extinguish, Shield of
Force.
3. Lord Oberon’s Seals: Contains the following Rank 1
spells: Decipher, Glyph of Sealing, Vapours of Dream.
4. Oliphan’s Folio: Contains the following Rank 1
spells: Crystal Resonance, Ioun Shard, Shield of Force.
5. Smythe’s Illuminations: Contains the following
Rank 1 spells: Decipher, Ignite / Extinguish, Ioun
Shard.
6. The Treatise on Force and Dissolution: Contains the
following Rank 1 spells: Crystal Resonance, Floating
Disc, Vapours of Dream.

Arcane Magic

See Arcane Magic, p78 for full details on arcane magic,
including learning spells, spell memorisation, and the list
of spells that magicians can learn.
Spell casting: The Magician Spells Per Day table shows the
number of spells a magician may memorise, determined
by the character’s Level. For example, a Level 3 magician
may memorise at most two Rank 1 spells and one Rank 2
spell.
Using magic items: Magicians can use magic items exclusive to arcane spell-casters (for example, magic wands or
scrolls of arcane spells).

Magician Skills

Magicians have one additional, specialised skill. The Magician Skill Targets table lists the character’s Skill Targets as
they advance in level.

Detect Magic
A magician can attempt to detect the subtle resonances
woven into an enchanted object, place, or creature. If the
attempt succeeds, the magician knows if the object, place,
or creature in question is magical—i.e. enchanted, affected
by a spell, or possessed of innate magic of some kind.
Requirements: The magician must touch the object, place,
or creature to be analysed and concentrate without distraction.
Time: Each attempt to detect magic requires 1 Turn.
Retrying: The magician may retry failed attempts as often
as they wish, each attempt requiring an additional 1 Turn.
Referee rolls: The Referee rolls all Detect Magic Checks,
so that players do not know if the roll failed or if there is
no magic present.
Downtime: Given an hour of solitude in a safe location, a
magician automatically detects magic on an object, place,
or creature.

nveterate scoundrels, thieves are always on the
lookout for their next mark, scam, or get rich
quick scheme. Many thieves are drawn to a life
of adventure, relishing exploration, peril, and the promise
of great wealth.

Starting Equipment
Armour (roll 1d6): 1–3. None. 4–6. Leather.
Weapons (roll 1d6 twice): 1. Club. 2. 3 daggers. 3. Longsword.
4. Shortbow + 20 arrows. 5. Shortsword. 6. Sling + 20 stones.
Class items: Thieves’ tools.

Back-Stab

Thieves are proficient in dealing deadly blows when attacking from behind with a dagger in melee.
Conditions: The thief must be positioned behind the
target, and the target must be unaware of the thief’s presence. If the thief successfully used their Stealth skill to hide
or sneak, the target is considered unaware.
Type of target: Back-stab may only be used against
mortals, fairies, or demi-fey of Small or Medium size.
Bonuses: The thief gains a +4 Attack bonus and inflicts
3d4 damage (modified by Strength) on a successful strike.
Magic daggers also add their enchantment bonus to backstab damage.

Thief Skills

As they advance in level, thieves improve their chance of
success with the Listen and Search skills. They also have six
additional, specialised skills. The Thief Skill Targets table
lists the character’s Skill Targets as they advance in Level.

Climb Wall

Natural 1: On a roll of natural 1, the thief must Save Versus
Doom or fall from the half way point, suffering 1d6 damage
per 10′ of the fall.
Retrying: The thief may retry failed attempts as often as
they wish, each subsequent attempt requiring 1 Turn.

Decipher Document
A successful check allows a thief to understand the gist of a
non-magical text in a language they do not speak, unravel
a cypher, or identify cryptically labelled landmarks on a
map.
Retrying: The thief may only attempt to read the same
document again after gaining a Level.

Disarm Mechanism
A successful check allows a thief to disarm complex, clockwork-like trap mechanisms hidden in a lock, lid, door
handle, or similar. Thieves’ tools are required for disarming mechanism traps (see Adventuring Gear, p116).
Time: Each attempt to disarm a trap requires 1 Turn.
Retrying: The thief may retry failed attempts as often as
they wish, each attempt requiring an additional 1 Turn.
Natural 1: On a roll of natural 1, the thief must Save Versus
Doom or accidentally spring the trap.

Legerdemain
A successful check allows a thief to pilfer a small item in
the possession of another creature or perform a trick of
sleight of hand, such as palming a small object or slipping
a poison into a drink.
Difficulty: –1 penalty per three Levels of the victim or
observer (e.g. a Level 6 target incurs a –2 penalty).
Natural 1: On a roll of natural 1, the thief must Save Versus
Doom to avoid being noticed. The Referee determines the
victim’s reaction.

Pick Lock
A successful check allows a thief to open a lock without
the key. Thieves’ tools are required for picking locks (see
Adventuring Gear, p116).

A successful check allows a thief to climb vertical or very
steep surfaces with only minimal handholds. The thief
does not require any special climbing equipment.

Time: Each attempt to pick a lock requires 1 Turn.

Easier circumstances: Thieves make easier climbs without
a roll (e.g. see Climbing, p150).

Difficult locks: The Referee may rule that certain locks are
more difficult. Advanced locks incur a penalty to the Pick
Lock Check or only allow a fixed number of attempts, after
which the thief is stymied and may only try again after
gaining a Level.

Long climbs: For climbs of over 100′, a Climb Wall Check is
required for each stretch of up to 100′. For example, a climb
of 150′ requires two checks.
Failure: The thief is unable to find suitable handholds and
makes no progress with the climb.

74

Retrying: The thief may retry failed attempts as often as
they wish, each attempt requiring an additional 1 Turn.

Stealth

Hiding and Ambushes under Stealth, p154.
Sneaking: If a Surprise Roll indicates that a thief’s party
has been detected, the thief may make a Stealth Check to
remain undetected. See Surprise, p164 and Sneaking
under Stealth, p154.

Thieves’ Cant

In addition to their native languages, thieves learn a secret
language of gestures and code words that allows them to
hide messages in seemingly normal conversations.

Customising Thief Skills (Optional Rule)
The Thief Skill Targets table lists the standard skill
progression, granting a balanced advancement across
all skills. Players wishing to customise their character’s
skill advancement may use this optional rule.
Base Skill Target: All skills begin at 6.
Expertise points: Thieves gain expertise points to
improve their skills. Each point allocated to a skill
lowers the Skill Target by 1.
At Level 1: At character creation, the player may allocate
4 expertise points.
Gaining Levels: At each Level gained, the player may
allocate 2 expertise points.
Minimum Skill Target: No Skill Target may be lowered
below 2.

“

agic. One word with so many meanings, some true
and some false. I take umbrage that common folk
call the prayers I make to the blessed saints holy
“magic,” but such is a small suffering for those blessings. Meanwhile, arcane scholars wield eldritch formulae to bend reality
to their will, enchanters and fairies deceive with a wave of the
hand, and mosslings practise strange knacks that linger on the
edge of where craft and magic meet. Strange powers abound
in this world, good folk, and when we traffic with those powers
we do so at risk to both body and soul. Tread carefully.”
—Brother Samwise Lank, wandering friar

Part Five | Magic

Arcane Magic
The workings of magicians, learned by esoteric study and arduous practice.

A

rcane spells take the form of patterns of magical energy imprinted into a character’s mind (a
process known as memorising a spell). When a
spell is cast, its pattern is erased from the character’s mind
until it is memorised again.

Spell Ranks

Spells are categorised by Rank, from Rank 1 (the least
powerful) to Rank 6 (the most powerful). An arcane
spell-caster’s Level determines which Rank of spells they
are able to cast.

Spell Books

Arcane spells are recorded in grimoires, treatises, tomes,
and folios, collectively known as spell books. Arcane
spell-casters collect and jealously hoard spell books, as
these works of eldritch study are the primary source of
their power.
Languages: Spell books may be written in common
languages (e.g. Woldish, Old Woldish, Caprice, Drunic),
in obscure or dead tongues, or occasionally in ciphers or
magical script (using the Arcane Cypher spell).

Learning Spells

There are several means by which an arcane spell-caster
learns new spells, each described below.
Spell Rank: It is only possible to learn spells of a Rank the
character can memorise, according to their Class and Level.
Blank spell books: Unless learning spells by studying from
a spell book, learned spells must be written into a spell
book (see Adventuring Gear, p116). Up to three spells
may be recorded in each spell book.

Learning From a Mentor
If a character has an established relationship with an
arcane spell-caster of at least 3 Levels higher, they may be
able to consult with them to learn new spells. Learning a
new spell from a mentor takes 1 week. The mentor usually
expects a service in return, perhaps sending the character
on a quest of some kind.

Simple Spell Books (Optional Rule)
Groups wishing to avoid keeping track of collections of
multiple spell books may rule instead that each caster
maintains but a single book containing all the spells
they have learned. In this case, all new spells learned
are copied into the character’s spell book.

78

Studying a Spell Book
As objects of great power, spell books are rarely found for
sale, but they may be found in treasure hoards or stolen
from rival spell-casters. To learn spells from a spell book,
the character must be able to understand the written
language (by dint of study or magic) and must spend time
attempting to learn the spells it contains.
Learning: Learning a spell from a spell book requires
1 week of quiet study per Rank of the spell. The character must then make an Intelligence Check. If the check
succeeds, they have learned the spell and may henceforth
memorise it. If the check fails, the character may not try
to learn this spell again before gaining a Level.

Researching a New Spell
Spells may also be added to a spell book by a process of
research, requiring 2 weeks and 1,000gp per Rank of
the spell. Any arcane spell listed in this book may be
researched. Players may also sometimes wish to invent
entirely new spells. In this case, the Referee must read
the proposed spell description, decide if the spell can be
researched, and set a Rank for the spell.
Chance of failure: Spell research is not always fruitful.
There is a minimum 1-in-6 chance of failure, in which case
the invested time and money are lost.

Lost Spell Books

In the event of disaster, an arcane spell-caster can rewrite
spells they have learned into a blank spell book (see Adventuring Gear, p116) by a process of research. This requires
1 week and 1,000gp per Rank of spell to be rewritten. For
example, rewriting three Rank 1 spells and one Rank 2 spell
would require 5 weeks and 5,000gp.

Part Five | Magic

Memorising Spells

Casting Spells

Rest: A character can only memorise spells following a
night’s rest.

Freedom: The character must be able to speak and must
have one hand free. An arcane spell-caster cannot cast
spells if gagged, bound, or in an area of magical silence.

An arcane spell-caster may memorise new spells once a
day, imprinting the energy patterns of spells they have
learned into their mind. Once memorised, a spell remains
in the character’s mind until cast.

Time: Memorising spells requires 1 hour of quiet study.
Spell books: Spell books containing the spells to be memorised must be to hand.
Number of spells: The maximum number of spells an
arcane spell-caster can imprint into their mind depends
on their Class and Level.
Duplicate spells: Characters capable of memorising more
than one spell of a given Rank may memorise multiple
copies of the same spell.

A memorised spell is cast by precisely replicating a specific
set of hand gestures and mystical words. When a spell is
cast, the imprinted pattern of magical energy is erased
from the caster’s mind until it is memorised again.

In combat: Casting a spell counts as the character’s action
in a Round, and the character may not move in the same
Round as casting a spell. The intention to cast a spell must
be declared before initiative is rolled. If the character is
harmed before their initiative, the spell is disrupted (see
Combat, p166).
Cumulative effects: If multiple spells increasing the
same statistic (e.g. bonuses to Attack, AC, damage, Saving
Throws, etc.) are cast on a single subject, only the most
powerful has effect.

Rank 1 Arcane Spells
The most basic spells worthy of an adventuring magician.

Crystal Resonance

Fairy Servant

Allows the caster to attune a gem or crystal (of at least 50gp
value) to copy certain energies from the environment or
to release copied energies. The spell manifests one of the
following effects when cast:

Summons an invisible sprite who performs the caster’s
bidding if gifted a pretty trinket (worth at least 50gp) or
a portion of magical fungus. The gift vanishes instantly.

Duration: Special
Range: 10′

1. Imprint: Holding the crystal aloft for 1 Turn, the caster
imprints it from the surroundings (the area within
range). A single type of energy (see Types of Energy) may
be imprinted into the crystal. Any energy previously
absorbed into the crystal is replaced. There is a 1-in-20
chance of the crystal shattering and becoming useless.
2. Release: Causes a previously imprinted crystal to
reproduce the stored energy in the environment it now
occupies (the area within range). Released energies only
reproduce normal ambient conditions and cannot cause
damage, blindness, deafness, or other special effects.

Types of Energies
Light: The lighting qualities of an environment may be
absorbed and reproduced, causing an area of light, gloom,
shadow, and so forth to be emitted from the crystal for 1
Turn per Level of the caster.
Images: A static snapshot of the crystal’s environment
can be absorbed for later examination. The image is reproduced for 1 Turn.
Sound: Any sound emitted during the 1 Turn absorption
time is recorded and may be reproduced.
Temperature: Warmth or cold may be absorbed into the
crystal and re-emitted for 1 Turn per Level of the caster.

Duration: 6 Turns
Range: 30′

Tasks: The sprite can manipulate small objects (e.g. open
a door, flip the pages of a book, pick up and drop a small
stone) or perform basic tasks such as cleaning or folding
clothes.
Capabilities: The sprite can fly and can carry or manipulate
objects weighing up to 80 coins. It cannot fight but may be
attacked by creatures that can see the invisible.

reading, but not as bright as daylight.
Heatless: The conjured flame does not produce heat and
cannot be used to ignite objects or cause damage.

Decipher

Flare: With a magic word, the caster may command the
flame to flare suddenly. All within 30′ who see the flare
must Save Versus Spell or be dazzled, suffering a –2 penalty
to Attack Rolls for 1d4 Rounds. The caster is not affected
by the flare, but allies may be unless warned to close their
eyes. After flaring, the flame disappears and the spell ends.

Script which the caster passes their hand over writhes,
glows, and temporarily transforms into common Woldish
text with the same meaning.

Duration: 2 Turns
Range: 5′

Script: Written information in any language, including
coded messages or symbols (e.g. on treasure maps) may

Motion: The disc floats at waist height, following the caster
as they move.
Expiration: Anything placed on the disc is dropped when
it disappears at the end of the spell’s duration.

Resisting commands: Subjects resist commands that
contradict their habits or Alignment. Suicidal or clearly
harmful commands are always refused.

Damage: The shard inflicts 1d6+1 damage.

the caster has not personally seen, viewers gain a +4 bonus

Range: 60′
Transforms the caster or another living subject into
another type of living creature, as chosen by the caster.
Cast on self: The transformation fails if the new form’s

and powers are acquired, along with behavioural patterns,
tendencies, and intelligence. The duration is permanent.
Specific individuals: The spell cannot be used to duplicate
a specific individual.

Creatures of Level 4 or greater: Can break a 5′ wide hole

resist the teleportation.
Destination: May be at any distance, but must be known
to the caster. The destination must be an open space at
ground level. (The caster may not intentionally teleport a
subject into mid-air or into solid matter.)
Risk: When teleporting, there is a risk of accidentally arriving above or below ground level. The chance of a successful
teleportation depends on the caster’s knowledge of the
destination (see below). Roll d100 and consult the Teleport
Result table.

after rain—remain).
Extreme heat: Dries up snow or mud (including the Mire
spell). Creatures in the area move at half Speed.
Fog: Visibility drops to 20′. Creatures in the area move at
half Speed and, at the Referee’s option, may also have a
chance of getting lost.
High winds: Creatures in the area move at half Speed.
Missile fire and flight are impossible. High winds may be
used to increase the sailing speed of ships by 50%. In sandy
areas, high winds cause sandstorms, reducing visibility
to 20′.

forms after 3 Turns, halving Speed.
Snow: Visibility drops to 20′. Creatures in the area move at
half Speed. Bodies of water begin to freeze. After the snow
thaws, mud remains and impedes movement.

memorised arcane spells burn the mind. Arcane spell-casters must Save Versus Spell or suffer 1 damage per memorised spell.

Geas

Duration: Permanent
Range: 30′
The caster compels a subject to perform—or avoid
performing—a specific action.
Examples: Bringing a specific item to the caster, eating or
drinking without restraint, keeping a certain fact secret.
Impossible or deadly tasks: The prescribed geas must not
be impossible or directly deadly—if such a geas is cast, it
rebounds and affects the caster instead.
Saving throw: The subject may Save Versus Spell to avoid
coming under the spell’s effect.
If the save fails: The subject must follow the stipulated
course of action or suffer gradually increasing (and eventually fatal) penalties determined by the Referee (e.g. Attack
penalties, Ability Score reductions, inability to memorise
spells, physical torment and feebleness, etc.).
Removing: Dispel Magic is ineffective against a geas.
Remove Curse and Hex Weaving only work if the caster is 2
or more Levels higher than the caster of Geas.

They may halt to perform other actions and then resume
concentration.

Word of Doom
Duration: Instant
Range: 240′

The caster announces the doom of creatures within a
selected 60′ cube.
Effect: A total of up to 4d8 Levels of creatures within the
area must Save Versus Doom or die, instantly. Creatures of
the lowest Level are affected first. For example, if four Level
3 and five Level 5 creatures are in the targeted area and the
4d8 roll results in 20, then all four Level 3 creatures and one
of the Level 5 creatures are affected (a total of 17 Levels).
Restrictions: Undead and creatures of greater than Level
7 are unaffected.

Part Five | Magic

Fairy Magic
Magic originating in the Timeless World, where all is woven with enchantment.

F

airy magic takes two forms—the glamours innate
to folk touched by Fairy and the runes guarded by
the fearsome fairy nobles.

Glamours

Glamours are innately possessed by natives of Fairy and by
other folk touched by the magic that weaves throughout
that world. Though mortals regard glamours as magic,
for fairies they are as natural as breathing, speaking, or
singing.

Learning Glamours
The number of glamours known by a character is determined by their Kindred, Class, and Level.

Using Glamours
Glamours are activated by thought alone, without the need
for gesture or incantation, unless noted otherwise in a
glamour’s description.
Glamour usage frequency: Unless noted otherwise in
its description, there is no limit to the number of times a
glamour may be used per day.
In combat: Using a glamour counts as the character’s
action in a Round. The character may move in the same
Round as using a glamour. The intention to use a glamour
need not be declared before initiative is rolled, and glamours cannot be disrupted (see Combat, p166).

Cumulative Effects
If multiple spells (or runes or glamours) increasing
the same statistic (e.g. bonuses to Attack, AC, damage,
Saving Throws, etc.) are cast on a single subject, only
the most powerful has effect.

Runes

The fairy runes are among the deepest magical secrets of
fairy-kind. Discovered by mighty elf sorcerers in aeons
long past, the runes tap into the magical fundament of
Fairy itself. Their usage is thus governed by ancient and
immutable laws of Fairy. Fairy nobles guard the knowledge
of the runes, and only they may bestow their use upon
individuals of lesser rank.
Intangibility: Runes are intangible; they are not physical
objects and thus cannot be stolen, lost, or given to another.
Magnitude: Runes are divided into three levels of magnitude: lesser runes, greater runes, and mighty runes.

Learning Runes
The acquisition of runes is governed by the mercurial
whims of the fairy nobles. Whenever a character (due to
their Class) has the chance of acquiring a new rune, the
player must roll 2d6 and consult the Rune Granted table.
Level modifier: Characters of Level 3–5 gain a +1 bonus to
the 2d6 roll, characters of Level 6–9 gain a +2 bonus, and
characters of Level 10 or above gain a +3 bonus.
Other modifiers: The Referee may optionally apply additional modifiers (bonuses or penalties, usually from –2 to
+2) to the 2d6 roll, based on the character’s relationship
with the fairy nobles. For example, a character who has
thwarted an important scheme of a fairy noble may suffer
a –2 penalty.
Granted runes: New runes are typically granted by means
of a dream or vision in which the character visits the
noble’s court.
Duplicates: If a rune is granted which the character already
knows, the number of times it may be used is doubled.
Quest: At the Referee’s option, the fairy noble may require
the character to perform some deed or quest in return for
the granting of the rune.

Part Five | Magic

Using Runes
Runes are activated by thought alone, without the need
for gesture or incantation, unless noted otherwise in a
rune’s description.
Rune usage frequency: The magical laws governing the
fairy runes place strict limits on the number of times a
rune may be used. This depends on the magnitude of the
rune (lesser, greater, or mighty) and the current Level of the
character (i.e. not the character’s Level when the rune was
granted). See the Rune Usage Frequency table.
In combat: Using a rune counts as the character’s action
in a Round, and the character may not move in the same
Round as using a rune. The intention to use a rune must
be declared before initiative is rolled. If the character is
harmed before their initiative, the rune is disrupted (see
Combat, p166).

Quests in Fairy (Optional Rule)
If the Referee wishes, a character may be required to
journey to a noble’s court in Fairy to receive a new rune,
rather than receiving it in a dream or vision. This journey may be narrated as a downtime event between
adventures or played out as a full adventure, depending
on the preferences of the group.
Entering Fairy: The character receives a special invitation from a fairy noble, allowing entrance to Fairy for a
short period via a special portal.
Passing of time: While the character journeys in Fairy,
2d20 days pass in the mortal world.

sausages, apples, etc.) out of thin air.

If the Morale Check fails: Creatures whose Levels total
up to the caster’s Level are awestruck and flee the caster’s
presence for 1d4 Rounds. Creatures of the lowest Level are
affected first. For example, if a Level 6 caster targets a group
of four Level 1 and five Level 2 creatures, all four Level 1
creatures and one of the Level 2 creatures are affected (a
total of 6 Levels).

Holy Magic
The spells bestowed upon devoted adherents of the Pluritine Church.

H

oly spells take the form of blessings bestowed
upon characters by the grace of the saints of the
Pluritine Church. When a spell is cast, the blessing expires until it is bestowed again.
Major and minor saints: Among the one hundred saints
venerated in Dolmenwood, thirty-four are primary and
have the power to bestow blessings upon those who pray
to them, each being associated with a specific spell. Certain
minor saints only bestow a blessing on those who pray
at their dedicated shrines, granting less common spells
outside of the standard holy spell list.
Saintly legends and patronages: The primary legend of
each saint is recounted beside the associated spell, along
with a list of the saint’s areas of patronage (minor patronages listed in parentheses).

Spell Ranks

Spells are categorised by Rank, from Rank 1 (the least
powerful) to Rank 5 (the most powerful). A holy spell-caster’s Level determines which Rank of spells they are able
to cast.

Praying For spells

A holy spell-caster may pray to the saints once per day,
receiving their blessings in the form of spells. Once
bestowed, a blessing remains with the character until the
spell is cast.
Rest: A character can only pray for spells following a
night’s rest.
Time: Praying for spells requires 1 hour of quiet prayer.
Number of spells: The maximum number of spells that
can be bestowed on a holy spell-caster at one time depends
on their Class and Level.
Spell selection: When praying for spells, a holy spell-caster
may choose any holy spell of appropriate Rank listed in
this book.
Duplicate spells: Characters capable of casting more than
one spell of a given Rank may pray for multiple copies of
the same spell.

Praying at Shrines

Shrines dedicated to specific saints are scattered throughout Dolmenwood. A holy spell-caster who prays for 1 hour
at such a shrine earns the blessing of the saint in the form
of an additional spell. Once bestowed, a blessing remains
with the character until the spell is cast. The DCB has full
details on praying at shrines.

Casting Spells

A bestowed spell may be cast by reciting a prayer in the
Liturgic tongue. When a spell is cast, the saint’s blessing
expires until it is bestowed again.
Speech: The character must be able to speak. A holy spellcaster cannot cast spells if gagged or in an area of magical
silence.
In combat: Casting a spell counts as the character’s action
in a Round, and the character may not move in the same
Round as casting a spell. The intention to cast a spell must
be declared before initiative is rolled. If the character is
harmed before their initiative, the spell is disrupted (see
Combat, p166).
Cumulative effects: If multiple spells increasing the
same statistic (e.g. bonuses to Attack, AC, damage, Saving
Throws, etc.) are cast on a single subject, only the most
powerful has effect.

Part Five | Magic

Rank 1 Holy Spells
Minor miracles of utility to adventuring adherents of the Church.

Detect Evil

Frost Ward

The caster perceives a faint halo of wicked, grinning spirits
flickering around objects under an evil enchantment and
living beings with evil intentions.

A soothing warmth comes upon all allies within range,
rebuking the malicious effects of cold and frost.

Prayer name: St Whittery’s Vision
Duration: 6 Turns
Range: 120′

Intent only: The caster cannot read the thoughts of creatures with evil intent.
Definition of evil: The Referee must judge what is classified
as evil. Beings of Chaotic Alignment do not always have
evil intent. Traps and poisons, while potentially harmful,
are not evil.
The miracle of St Whittery of the Woods: The son of a woodsman, Whittery was raised in a small village deep in western
Dolmenwood. A group of noble travellers, merry and fair of
face, stopped at the village inn one eve, to the delight of the
locals. Reciting his evening prayers at the village chapel, the
young Whittery was visited by a horrific vision of bloodshed
at the hands of the noble guests. He reported his vision to
the vicar, who informed the village elders. The nobles were
confronted and revealed to be fairy shape-shifters who had
planned to slay everyone in the village and roast their innards.
(As fate would have it, many years later, after Whittery had
moved to study at a distant monastery, the village was visited
once more by evil fairies, who stole the place away to Fairy,
never to be seen again by mortal eyes.) Patronages: Visions,
premonitions, (warding against fairies), (lost souls).

Detect Magic

Prayer name: Wisdom of St Thorm
Duration: 2 Turns
Range: 60′
Enchanted objects, areas, or creatures within range of the
caster are wreathed in a shimmering, golden glow. Both
permanent and temporary enchantments are revealed.
The miracle of St Thorm, Faith-Smith: Wandering in Dolmenwood as a pilgrim, Thorm was captured by elves for daring to
trespass close to a magical door to Fairy. The young pilgrim was
cast into the dungeons of the cruel fairy Prince Mallowheart,
where he was to rot away to bones. When Mallowheart visited
the prisoner to gloat over his suffering, Thorm challenged the
fairy lord to a game of cards. The saint’s holy eyes saw through
the magical treachery which inevitably ensued (Mallowheart
being notoriously unsportsmanlike) and defeated the prince,
thus assuring his release. Patronages: Gamblers, prisoners,
(blacksmiths).

102

Prayer name: St Abthius’ Rebuke
Duration: 6 Turns
Range: 30′

Normal cold: Subjects are untroubled by non-magical
freezing temperatures.
Save bonus: Subjects gain a +2 bonus to Saving Throws
versus cold-based effects (e.g. magic or breath attacks).
Cold-based damage: Reduce cold damage by 1 per damage
die rolled. (For example, 4d6 damage is reduced by 4.)
The miracle of St Abthius, Ever-Lustrous: Abthius came to
Dolmenwood at the command of King Thaldred II of Brackenwold. The Cold Prince had newly returned his frigid gaze to the
mortal world, and Abthius—renowned for his fiery sermons—
served as ambassador of the King. Gaining an audience with
the fairy court, the saint proceeded to preach the virtues of
the One True God and the host of angels. The fairies responded
only with mocking laughter, and their liege pointed his crystal
wand at the saint, casting a spell of ice about him. The saint’s
radiant beauty melted the fey frost, and he turned his back on
the Prince, damning the fairy to be vaporised in the flames of
perdition. Patronages: Ambassadors, righteous vengeance,
(courtly dances), (seamstresses), (springtime).

Lesser Healing

Prayer name: Breath of St Lillibeth
Duration: Instant
Range: The caster or a living creature touched
The fluttering of doves’ wings and the sweet scent of blossom manifest as the caster recites this prayer. A living
subject receives one of the following ministrations:
1. Healing: Restores 1d6+1 Hit Points. This cannot raise
the subject’s Hit Points above the normal maximum.
2. Curing paralysis: Paralysing effects are negated.
The miracle of St Lillibeth of the Sugared Breath: Lillibeth
lived as a hermit in the deep woods, with only the company of
doves. She was slain when her cottage was attacked by marauding crookhorns, but with her last breaths, she gave ministration to six doves which had been wounded. The birds were
miraculously cured, flew hence to the chapel at Wayforough,
and told the curate of their mistress’s pious deeds. Patronages:
Doves, fowl, (virgins), (messengers).

Part Five | Magic

Light

Purify Food and Drink

A bobbing wisp of light floats from the caster’s palm and
manifests one of the following effects:

The sound of distant goat bells echoes and a quantity of
poisoned, rotten, spoiled, or contaminated food and drink
is purified.

Prayer name: St Foggarty’s Benediction
Duration: 12 Turns
Range: 120′

1. Golden radiance: Casts holy light in a 15′ radius. The
light is sufficient for reading, but is not as bright as
daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which
case the golden light moves with the object.
2. Blinding a creature: A flash of divine light blinds a
Chaotic creature for the duration. The target may Save
Versus Spell to resist. (See Darkness and Blindness,
p150.)
3. Cancelling magical darkness: St Foggarty’s Benediction
may cancel a 15′ radius area of magical darkness.
The miracle of St Foggarty of the Cup: Foggarty spent his
dotage ministrating to an isolated community of peat-cutters.
When a party of pilgrims lost their way in the peat bogs one
night, Foggarty commanded the marsh lights to lead them to
safety. Patronages: Lost travellers, (peat-cutters).

Mantle of Protection
Prayer name: St Benester’s Word
Duration: 12 Turns
Range: The caster

Invoking the name of an archangel, the caster is warded
from attacks by Chaotic creatures as well as creatures
created or summoned by magic.
AC and Saving Throw bonus: The caster gains a +1 Armour
Class and Saving Throw bonus against attacks and special
powers of affected creatures.
Magically created or summoned creatures: The prayer
additionally prevents such creatures from making
melee attacks against the caster, though they may still
make ranged attacks. If the caster engages such a creature in melee, this protection is broken (though the caster
still gains the Armour Class and Saving Throw bonuses
mentioned above).

Prayer name: St Gretchen’s Sublimation
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch

Quantity: Up to 12 portions of food and drink, in any
combination. 1 ration counts as a portion of food and 1
pint counts as a portion of drink.
The miracle of St Gretchen the Maiden: Witnessing the aftermath of a battle and the wretched gasps of the wounded, St
Gretchen enlisted a band of goat-herds to gather water from
a nearby bog. The water was black and putrid, but when the
saint passed her hallowed hands above it, it became as pure as
spring rain and soothed the woes of the wounded. Patronages:
Victims of battle, (goat-herds).

Rally

Prayer name: St Jorrael’s Counsel
Duration: 2 Turns
Range: The caster or a creature touched
The emboldening words of this prayer reverberate in the
subject’s mind, calming them and purging them of fear.
Magically induced fear: Make a Save Versus Spell with a +1
bonus per Level of the caster to counter magical terror. This
applies to effects active when Rally is cast and subsequent
effects during the duration.
The miracle of St Jorrael, God-Friend: As a wandering mendicant in her middle years, Jorrael came upon a village under the
tyrannical rule of a baron and his cruel knights. Preaching at a
village council, the saint’s words emboldened the downtrodden villagers, who subsequently rose up against the despot
baron and brought him and his lackeys to justice. Patronages:
The downtrodden, (beggars), (anglers).

The miracle of St Benester the Right-Believing: As a young
monk, Benester was afflicted with agues. Placing his life in
the hand of God, he left his monastery to wander the wilds.
On a seven night fast in the wilderness, Benester was assailed
by the demonic servitors of an evil sorcerer who counted the
region as his domain. Undeterred, the saint invoked the name
of the seventeen archangels and continued his prayers amid
the wailing and caterwauling of the monsters. Patronages:
Hermits, fasting, (choirboys)

Part Five | Magic

Rank 2 Holy Spells
Lesser miracles bestowed on experienced servants of the Church.

Bless

Find Traps

Accompanied by the triumphant blaring of trumpets, a
surge of divine righteousness bolsters the morale of allies
within a 20′ × 20′ area.

Trapped objects and areas within range of the caster are
wreathed in an apparition of faint, flickering flames.

Bonuses: Subjects gain a +1 bonus to Attack and Damage
Rolls.

No disarm: The spell provides no assistance bypassing or
deactivating traps, only revealing their locations.

Prayer name: Righteousness of St Gondyw
Duration: 6 Turns
Range: 60′

Retainers: Also gain a +1 bonus to Loyalty.
The miracle of St Gondyw, Converter of Kings: An honoured
guest at a king’s tourney, St Gondyw overheard blasphemous
words upon his host’s lips. Boldly admonishing the king,
Gondyw suggested a challenge of the might of the One True
God: if the humble scribe who accompanied Gondyw could
defeat the king’s champion in single combat, the king would
swear his fealty to the Church. The king accepted, the challenge
seeming preposterous, but was dumbstruck when the scrawny
altar-boy (with St Gondyw’s blessing) wrestled his knight to the
ground. Patronages: Scribes, (tourneys), (knights).

Charm Serpents
Prayer name: St Dank’s Plea
Duration: 1d4 Rounds or 1d4 Turns
Range: 60′

This prayer hypnotises snakes; the serpents rear upright
and sway to and fro, but they never attack while charmed.
Number of snakes affected: Snakes whose Levels total up
to twice the caster’s Level. For example, a Level 3 caster
could affect three Level 2 snakes, two Level 3 snakes, etc.
The caster selects which individuals are affected.
Duration: When cast on snakes that are already attacking,
the effect lasts for 1d4 Rounds. Otherwise, it lasts for 1d4
Turns.
The miracle of St Dank of the Thorn: Venturing as a missionary to a distant land, Dank came to a shrine where a serpent
demon was revered. The snake-worshippers captured the
saint and set about preparing to sacrifice him before their idol.
Suspended above a pit of writhing asps, Dank prayed for divine
aid. The snakes rose up, gnawed St Dank’s bonds loose, and led
him through a secret door to safety. Patronages: Missionaries,
(serpents), (secret passages).

104

Prayer name: Path of St Gripe
Duration: 2 Turns
Range: 30′

Magical and mechanical traps: All are revealed.

The miracle of St Gripe the Forthright: When a fire raged
across local farmlands, the young Gripe (a lowly apprentice
monk, at the time) led the fearful livestock through the woods
to escape. Only by the will of God did Gripe and his flock avoid
falling into the profusion of cruel traps that had been laid in
the woods by the local baron, a man who obsessively hunted
and killed wild animals. Patronages: Shepherds, (cowherds),
(hunters), (conflagrations).

Flame Ward

Prayer name: Boldness of St Hollyhock
Duration: 2 Turns
Range: 30′
A puff of flour and the aroma of freshly baked bread manifest around a single creature of the caster’s choosing, which
is bestowed with supernatural resistance to fire.
Normal heat: The subject is unharmed by non-magical
heat or fire.
Save bonus: The subject gains a +2 bonus to Saving Throws
versus fire-based effects (e.g. magic or breath attacks).
Fire-based damage: Reduce fire damage by 1 per damage
die rolled. (For example, 4d6 damage is reduced by 4.)
The miracle of St Hollyhock the Jubilant: As a young acolyte,
Hollyhock was standing in a village square, begging for
alms. Hearing a commotion in the local bakery, she ran to
offer her aid. She was confronted by a group of angry locals
who had pushed an old woman into the flames of the baker’s
oven, believing her to have hexed the village’s flock of geese
with wicked magic. Incensed by this unjust deed, Hollyhock
invoked the blessing of the One True God and climbed into the
oven to rescue the unfortunate woman. Patronages: Crones,
(bakers’ ovens).

Part Five | Magic

Hold Person

SILENCE

The caster castigates one or more mortals, fairies, or demifey for their misdeeds, causing them to halt in their tracks
if they fail a Save Versus Hold. The spell may be used in
two ways:

Raising a finger to their lips, the caster whispers a hushed
prayer to St Signis the Silent. A 15′ radius area within range
is shrouded in holy silence.

Prayer name: St Waylaine’s Reproof
Duration: 9 Turns
Range: 180′

penalised by –2.
2. Against a group: 1d4 individuals in the group are

Paralysis: Affected targets are aware but cannot move their
limbs. They may, at the caster’s option, speak.
Freeing: The caster may free paralysed targets with a word.
The miracle of St Waylaine of the Sack: The origin of St
Waylaine is somewhat uncertain, with varying depictions of
the saint as a man and a woman. Falsely accused of treason
and tax evasion, Waylaine (then a vicar of low repute) was due
to be executed by beheading. The executioner, however, was
unable to bring the axe down upon the saint’s neck, his limbs
freezing at the apex of every strike. After the sub-executioner
and the assistant executioner experienced the same anomaly,
the saint was pardoned. Patronages: Executioners, axe-grinders, (merciful lords).

Reveal Alignment
Prayer name: St Willofrith’s Warning
Duration: Instant
Range: 30′

An angelic voice whispers in the caster’s mind, revealing
the Alignment of a selected character, monster, object, or
area within range. (Most objects and areas do not have an
Alignment, but magic items or holy places may.)
The miracle of St Willofrith the Wide: Willofrith was a tomb
robber in his younger days, desecrating ancient barrows to
relieve the deceased of their riches. One day, he unearthed
a sword of great beauty, engraved with ancient script and
bedecked with amethysts and pearls. As his hand reached out
to grasp the hilt, he received an angelic vision warning him
not to touch the weapon, for it housed a spirit of Chaos. Saved
from possession, the young thief was converted to a man of
God. Patronages: Repentance, (pie-makers), (swordsmiths).

Prayer name: Abjuration of St Signis
Duration: 12 Turns
Range: 180′

Within the area: All sound is prevented. Conversation and
spell casting are impossible.
Noise from outside: Those within the area of silence can
only hear sounds from outside it.
Casting upon a creature: Silence may be cast upon a creature, which must Save Versus Spell. If the Saving Throw
fails, the shrouded 15′ radius area of silence moves with the
target. If the Saving Throw succeeds, the spell has no effect.
The miracle of St Signis the Silent: As a young monk, Signis
sat for days on end in the abbey crypts, gazing in rapture at the
statues of the venerated saints and angels. When the abbey
was plagued with moaning phantoms, Signis merely raised his
finger calmly to his lips and the crypt where he sat fell utterly
silent. Patronages: Warding the dead, (holy silence).

Speak With Animals
Prayer name: Speech of St Hamfast
Duration: 6 Turns
Range: The caster

Animals of one selected species prick up their ears to the
lilting words of this prayer. The caster can speak with all
animals of that type for the duration.
Type of animal: The spell translates for one species of
normal or giant animals at a time. Intelligent animals and
fantastic monsters are not affected.
Services: Animals which are friendly towards the caster
may be persuaded to perform a service. The service must
be within an animal’s comprehension and capabilities.
The miracle of St Hamfast, Cloud-Head: Hamfast gave
sermons to the wild beasts of the forest, converting many to
the faith. By the time of his death, Hamfast’s woodland retreat
was home to a trio of bears and some three dozen devout squirrels, mice, and crows. The animals spent their days studying
scripture and illuminating manuscripts. Patronages: Bears,
(weather diviners).

Rank 3 Holy Spells
Miracles of great potency bestowed on blessed servants of the Church.

Animal Growth

Bless Weapon

A single animal is briefly haloed with glimmering Liturgic
script (the text of this prayer), turns its eyes toward the
heavens, and doubles in size.

Silver light arcs from the caster’s hand and wreathes a
single weapon, enchanting it with holy power.

Damage: Double the damage of the animal’s melee attacks.

Treated as magical: The weapon now harms monsters
which can only be harmed by magic.

Prayer name: Mercy of St Vinicus
Duration: 12 Turns
Range: 120′

Load: Double the maximum weight the animal can carry.
Restrictions: This spell may be used on normal or giant
animals, but intelligent animals, magical animals, and
fantastic monsters are unaffected.
The miracle of St Vinicus, Thrice-Hanged: The young Vinicus served as a vicar’s assistant in an isolated region bordering on a vast swamp. His days were spent cloistered in the
church crypts copying Liturgic texts, with mice and shrews his
only companions. The animals took to scurrying from their
burrows and climbing upon the young priest’s desk, quietly
observing his painstaking illumination and calligraphy. When
a great storm caused the surrounding swamp and rivers to
swell, the church was inundated and the crypts flooded, ruining years of Vinicus’ work. Pitying the mice and shrews whose
companionship he held dear, Vinicus prayed for their salvation. The animals were transformed into gigantic stature—as
large as ponies—and burrowed out of the crypts unharmed.
The great holes they made in the church walls as they escaped
were maintained as proof of this miracle. Patronages: Mice,
(churchwardens).

Prayer name: Courage of St Sedge
Duration: 1 Turn
Range: 30′

Damage: The weapon deals an additional 1d6 damage.

The miracle of St Sedge the Unblemished: In his youth, Sedge
served as a knight’s page and became embroiled in a bloody
war against the armies of a sorcerer king. His master was slain
by a spectral warrior, whom Sedge then confronted alone on
the field of battle. Praying to the One True God, he defeated the
monster with only his dirk, which was enveloped in a silvery
radiance. The site of the monster’s destruction scarred the
land with a circle of ash, upon which an obelisk recounting
the life of St Sedge was erected in later years. Patronages: Holy
warriors, (knifemakers).

Cure Affliction

Prayer name: St Pastery’s Blessing
Duration: Instant
Range: 30′
The lowing of cattle can be heard as the caster recites this
prayer. A living subject receives one of the following ministrations:
1. Cure disease: The subject is purged of a single disease
of mundane or magical origin.
2. Cure blindness or deafness: The subject’s sight or
hearing are restored, nullifying any disease, curse, or
enchantment that veiled them.
The miracle of St Pastery, Butter-Monger: In his later years,
Pastery left his position as vicar in the village of his birth and
took up the life of a mendicant. Refused entry to the castle
of the ailing Prince Wallobringe during a plague epidemic,
St Pastery blessed the hands of all butchers and cow-herds
within a ten mile radius. The saint thus ensured that all meat
brought to the prince in his sickbed carried the blessing of the
host of heaven, restoring him to health, despite his refusal to
admit Pastery. (Wallobringe is a beloved figure of fable, known
as Good-Prince-Wallobringe, and famed for his generosity,
compassion, and love of mince pies.) Patronages: Butchers,
(well-borers).

Holy Light

Locate Object

A ray of white light beams from the caster’s raised hand
and manifests one of the following effects:

A cherub-like apparition of the infant St Keye points in
the direction of a sought object, adjusting the indicated
direction as the caster moves. One of two types of objects
may be located:

Prayer name: Devotion of St Eggort
Duration: Permanent or 6 Turns
Range: 120′

1. Eternal radiance: Casts holy light in a 30′ radius. The
light is as bright as full daylight (creatures that suffer
penalties in daylight are affected). The prayer may only
be cast upon a fixed location within range—the eternal
radiance does not move. The duration is permanent.
2. Beacon of sanctity: White light radiates in a 15′ radius
around a chosen object. Undead creatures suffer a –2
penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws while within
the radius of light. The duration is 6 Turns.
3. Cancelling magical darkness: Devotion of St Eggort
may cancel a 30′ radius area of magical darkness.
The miracle of St Eggort the Troglodyte: Taking on unusually
severe oaths of solitude and silence, Eggort devoted his life to
prayer in the crypt of the monastery where he dwelt. Spending
his days alone in the darkness, Eggort’s devotion manifested,
over many years as a flickering glow upon the altar. This light
grew and grew until, at the time of Eggort’s death, the crypt
was lit as bright as day, as if by the light of a thousand votive
candles. The crypt exists to this day as a site of pilgrimage.
Patronages: Chandlers, (undertakers).

Prayer name: St Keye’s Revelation
Duration: 6 Turns
Range: 120′

1. General class: An object of a general class (e.g. a stairway, an altar, etc.). In this case, the nearest object of that
type is located.
2. Specific object: A specific object which the caster can
clearly visualise in all aspects.
Restrictions: This spell cannot be used to locate creatures.
The miracle of St Keye the Chronicler: The son of a noble,
Keye was born into a life of luxury, with a retinue of servants
tending to his family’s every need. Even as an infant, Keye was
fascinated with the manor’s vast libraries of tomes, scrolls,
and chronicles, pulling books off of the shelves and gazing at
their pages with wonder. On the eve of Keye’s second birthday,
scornful knights in the service of a neighbouring duke arrived
at the manor. Presenting befuddling legal documents, the
knights announced their liege’s claim to the lands of Keye’s
family and his plan to instate his youngest son as lord of their
manor. Unable to present any counter-evidence and fearing
the cruel duke’s military might, the family solemnly prepared
to accept their fate. Upon the arrival of the duke’s smirking
son to take up his promised lordship, the infant Keye, unable
to read or write, miraculously produced a lost charter proving his family’s right to their lands. Patronages: Historians,
(infants), (lost objects).

Remove Curse

Prayer name: St Primula’s Grace
Duration: Instant
Range: The caster or a creature touched
Milk drips from the caster’s hand as they recite this prayer.
The subject, doused in holy milk, is permanently cured of
the affliction of a single curse.
Cursed items: Use of this spell enables a character to
discard a cursed magic item.
The miracle of St Primula the Beneficent: Born to a servant
family, Primula spent her youth as a milkmaid. As the sun set
one autumn eve, she encountered a wretched, scrawny man,
hobbling along on a stick and dragging a sack behind him.
Pitying him, she invited him into a barn and offered him a
bowl of curds and whey. The man revealed his story, claiming
to be a knight named Sir Gamulet, stricken by a fairy curse
of weakness and reduced to dragging his armour in a sack.
Primula bade the accursed knight to lay his head on the straw
and began to wash the grime from his face. A group of oxen
gathered around and, mimicking the maid’s deed, proceeded
to gently lick the knight until he fell soundly asleep. Upon
awakening the next morning, Sir Gamulet’s strength had
miraculously returned, the wicked fairy curse washed away
by the ministrations of Primula and her oxen. Patronages:
Oxen, (the strong of arms).

Rank 4 Holy Spells
Powerful miracles bestowed on exalted servants of the Church.

Create Water

Prayer name: St Quister’s Defence
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
A magical fount of wine-red water springs forth from the
ground or a wall. The liquid looks and tastes like a sweet,
refreshing wine, but it is actually pure water.
Volume: The fount produces enough to sustain 12 people
and 12 mounts for one day (approximately 50 gallons).
Higher Level casters: If the caster is higher than Level 9,
water sufficient for an additional 12 people and mounts is
produced for each Level beyond 9.

Circle of Protection
Prayer name: St Faxis’ Abjuration
Duration: 12 Turns
Range: 10′ around the caster

The miracle of St Quister, Ever-Loyal: Attending a royal feast
as an emissary of the Church, Quister received a divine vision
warning him that the wine being served was poisoned. Leaping
onto the table before the king, the priest prayed to the One
True God, desperately pleading for the wine to be purified.
Miraculously, all the host’s wine was instantly transmuted
into pure water. Misunderstanding the priest’s ravings as an
affront to the king, the royal guard dragged him from the table
and executed him on the spot. Only later was it discovered that
the wine was poisoned and that Quister was acting to save the
king. Patronages: Vintners, beefeaters, (hounds).

A sword of glowing light manifests and inscribes a 10′
radius circle around the caster, leaving a shimmering ring
of light which moves with the caster. The caster and all
allies within the circle come under the effect of a Mantle of
Protection, warded against attacks by Chaotic creatures as
well as creatures created or summoned by magic.

Greater Healing

AC and Saving Throw bonus: Those warded gain a +1
Armour Class and Saving Throw bonus against attacks
and special powers of affected creatures.

The rustic voice of St Wick manifests, whispering a parable
as the caster touches a living subject.

Magically created or summoned creatures: The prayer
additionally prevents such creatures from making melee
attacks against those warded, though they may still make
ranged attacks. If any of the warded party engages such a
creature in melee, this protection is broken (those warded
still gain the Armour Class and Saving Throw bonuses
mentioned above).
The miracle of St Faxis the Penitent: Surrounded by malicious sorcerers in the depths of Dolmenwood, Faxis—a young
soldier, at the time—valiantly drew his sword and challenged
them in the name of God to come within reach of the blade.
Cackling, the wizards advanced. However, by the will of God,
they were unable to come close enough to accost the young
Faxis and their evil magic was repulsed. Patronages: Seekers,
hunters of evil sorcerers, (soldiers).

108

Prayer name: Steadfastness of St Wick
Duration: Instant
Range: The caster or a creature touched

Healing: The prayer restores 2d6+2 Hit Points to the
subject. This cannot raise the subject’s Hit Points above
the normal maximum.
The miracle of St Wick the Venerable: A man of humble
origins, Wick worked as a bargeman, ferrying passengers
across a great lake and entertaining them with religious
parables along the way. When a belligerent knight became
angered and impaled Wick upon his lance, the saint-to-be
calmly removed himself from the weapon’s shaft and continued preaching, the wound miraculously healed. Patronages:
Ferry-folk, (grandfathers).

Remove Poison

Serpent Transformation

The rattling of manacles echoes as a warm light envelops the caster’s hand. The light neutralises poison in one
touched creature or object.

Accompanied by the merry laughter of St Horace and the
waft of freshly unearthed mushrooms, 2d8 normal sticks
leap to attention and miraculously transform into adders.

Living creature: Neutralise the effects of poison on a living
subject. A subject that has died from poisoning can be
revived (restored to 1 Hit Point) if Remove Poison is cast
within 10 Rounds.

Commands: The snakes follow the caster’s orders for the
duration of the spell.

Prayer name: St Torphia’s Respite
Duration: Instant
Range: The caster or a creature or object touched

Object or substance: Remove poison from an item, food,
or liquid.
The miracle of St Torphia of the Solitudes: Torphia lived in
a land where the faithful of the Pluritine Church were persecuted. She was captured and thrown into a dungeon. Her cruel
captors took to feeding her nothing but poisonous berries.
Before her eventual execution and martyrdom, Torphia
survived for seven months on naught save the poison fruit
and the will of God. Patronages: The unjustly imprisoned,
(foragers), (prison guards).

Speak with Plants
Prayer name: Salvation of St Wort
Duration: 3 Turns
Range: The caster

A vision of a great yew tree briefly manifests behind the
caster, its limbs arching protectively overhead. The caster
gains the miraculous ability to communicate with plants.
Normal plants: Flora informs the caster of creatures that
have recently passed or performs simple favours. For
example, plants may clear a passageway for the caster’s
party to pass through or writhe and tangle into an impassable thicket to hinder pursuers.
Monstrous plants: The caster can communicate with
plant-like or plant-based monsters.

Prayer name: St Horace’s Requital
Duration: 6 Turns
Range: 120′

Reversion: When the spell ends or a snake is killed, the
serpent reverts back to a normal stick.

Poison: Save Versus Doom or suffer 1 damage per Round
for the next 1d6 Rounds.
When killed: The snake reverts back to a normal stick.
The miracle of St Horace the Puissant: As a young friar,
Horace (known colloquially as “Brother Windbag”) wandered
the paths of Dolmenwood, bringing the light of the One True
God—in addition to the delights of his sackful of mushrooms—to isolated hamlets. One evening, as Horace recited his
bedtime prayers, a pook morel (a type of sentient mushroom
with a penchant for theft) jumped out from behind a mossy log.
Using its powers of illusion, the pook transformed the friar’s
rosary into a wriggling centipede. Recoiling in horror, Horace
dropped the insect into the grasp of the giggling pook. As the
mushroom fled into a thicket, Horace prayed for retribution.
The rosary transformed once more: this time into a hissing
adder, which grabbed the pook in its fangs and brought it to the
friar’s feet. After a night of penance within Horace’s mushroom
sack, the pook morel was released, under the condition that it
would spread the word of the Pluritine Church among its kind.
It is said that, since that day, pook morels, though unable to
change their nature, refuse to steal from friars. Patronages:
Mendicants, adders, (mushrooms).

The miracle of St Wort the Benignant: As a wandering
pilgrim, St Wort was accosted by bandits. They robbed the
saint, stripped him naked, tied him to a lone yew tree atop a
barren hill, and left him to die. St Wort implored the One True
God to come to his aid. In response, the yew tree upon which
he hung took pity on the saint and twisted its branches to
snap his bonds. The saint thanked the tree and blessed all of
its kind, which to this day are regarded as holy. Patronages:
Yew trees, (coppicers).

Communion

Create Food

This prayer allows the caster to enter into communion with
one of the ascended saints, asking questions and receiving
answers relaying the divine wisdom of the One True God.
The spell must be cast upon the saint’s feast day (see the
free Dolmenwood Calendar PDF at dolmenwood.com).

Barrels and hampers of fresh food wash up on a foaming
swell of seawater. The brine disappears instantly, but the
food remains.

Trance: For the duration of the spell, the caster is in a
spiritual trance, unaware of the world around them.

Higher Level casters: If the caster is higher than Level 9,
food sufficient for an additional 12 people and mounts is
produced for each Level beyond 9.

Prayer name: St Elsa’s Visitation
Duration: 3 Turns
Range: The caster

Questions: The caster may ask 3 questions of the saint.
Answers: Each question receives a simple “yes” or “no”
answer. The answers are guaranteed to be true.
Usage limit: Communion may be cast once per week. The
Referee can limit it to once per month if overused.
St Clewyd: For theologically unclear reasons, St Clewyd
does not respond to this spell.
The miracle of St Elsa, Balm-Gusher: As the vicar of a coastal
village, Elsa received a vision of a great flood on the eve of
the feast of St Whittery. Heeding this prophecy, she insisted
that a high tower be built, with enough space to house the
inhabitants of the village and their livestock. The project was
regarded by many as a folly, but the saint’s visions were vindicated when a great sea dragon, hunted by the famed knight Sir
Willowthorn, was beached and slain, opening a sea bay which
engulfed the village. To this day, the saint’s tower is the sole
surviving element of the original settlement. Patronages:
Floods, towers, hunters of sea monsters, (follies).

Prayer name: St Ponch’s Feast
Duration: Permanent
Range: Appears in the caster’s presence

Volume: Food sufficient for 12 people and 12 mounts is
conjured—enough to last one day.

The miracle of St Ponch the Prudent: Ponch was a whaler in
a northern land. When a leviathan destroyed the vessel he
worked on, he was the sole survivor of the wreck and drifted
for weeks alone on a spur of wood. Offering his soul to the
One True God, the young seaman was miraculously provided
with fresh pears and scones. A month later, he washed up on
the shore at Dretcher’s Bay in fighting fit (and evangelistic)
condition. Patronages: Whalers, castaways, (scones), (pears).

Holy Fire

Prayer name: St Goodenough’s Rebuke
Duration: Concentration (up to 1 Turn) or instant
Range: 30′ or the caster or a creature touched
A column of holy fire surrounds the caster, channelling
divine grace for one of three purposes:
1. Circle of warding: By concentrating and remaining
stationary, the caster creates a ward against undead
and creatures created or summoned by magic. Any such
creature that comes within 30′ must Save Versus Spell
or be destroyed or banished to its place of origin. If a
monster’s save succeeds, it flees the warded area.
2. Target single monster: Instantly banish or destroy a
single magically-summoned, created, or undead creature within range. The monster may Save Versus Spell
(with a –2 penalty) to avoid banishment or destruction.
If the monster’s save succeeds, it flees the affected area.
3. Restoration: Touching a subject instantly removes a
curse, disease, or other affliction.
The miracle of St Goodenough the Hearty: In old age, Goodenough left his cloistered life and took a vow of mendicant
poverty. Wandering the forest, he was tricked into the cottage
of an evil sorceress with promises of warm stew. Goodenough
escaped the clutches of her horde of straw-manikins by invoking the fiery light of God. The sinister, creeping dolls were
destroyed by holy fire, and the saint fled with his life. Patronages: Warding against evil, (corn-dolls), (picnics).

Holy Quest

Raise Dead

Accompanied by a clap of thunder and a ray of holy light,
the caster commands a single subject to perform a specific
quest or task.

The ultimate miracle—by the grace of God, a deceased
person may be returned to life.

Prayer name: Righteousness of St Galaunt
Duration: Until quest is completed
Range: 30′

Example quests: Rescuing a prisoner, killing a specific
monster, bringing a magic item to the caster, going on a
journey to a holy site.
Suicidal quests: The prescribed quest must not be obviously suicidal.
Refusal: The subject must undertake the quest or suffer a
–2 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
Completion: Once the task is completed, the spell ends.
Saving throw: The subject may Save Versus Spell to resist
the holy compulsion, negating the effects of the spell.
The miracle of St Galaunt the Wonderworker: As an old man,
St Galaunt dwelt as a hermit in the frost-marshes of the north,
visited by pilgrims seeking his counsel. One day, a vain man
named Hoggeld knocked upon the saint’s door, claiming to
also be blessed by God and boastfully wishing to demonstrate
his divine powers. In the presence of the true saint, Hoggeld’s
supposed powers failed him. Galaunt commanded the shamed
pilgrim journey south to retrieve the fabled chalice of St
Indominant, lost for generations. For seventeen years did
Hoggeld wander, seeking the fabled chalice. Finally uncovering it in the hoard of a desert demon, he brought it to the
holy city of Loom, where it rests to this day. The return of the
chalice was attributed largely to the wisdom of St Galaunt.
Patronages: Pilgrimage, truth-seeing, (marsh-dwellers).

Insect Plague

Prayer name: Mercy of St Clewyd
Duration: Instant
Range: 120′

Restrictions: Mortals may be raised. Fairies and demifey may not, the fate of their souls being outside of the
purview of the Pluritine Church.
Ritual: Raise Dead requires a grandiose ritual in a cathedral (e.g. in Castle Brackenwold), the participation of a
dozen priests, and the burning of rare incenses to the value
of 2,000gp. Despite its title, the ritual makes no reference
to St Clewyd.
Time limit: The subject must have been dead no longer
than 2 days per Level of the caster. (e.g. a Level 10 caster can
revive someone who has been dead up to 20 days.)
Weakness: Returning from death is an ordeal. Until the
subject gets 2 full weeks of bed rest, they have 1 Hit Point,
move at half Speed, cannot carry heavy items, and cannot
attack, cast spells, make Skill Checks, or use other Class
capabilities. This period of weakness may not be shortened
by any magical healing.
The miracle of St Clewyd the Refulgent: As chief among the
saints revered in Dolmenwood, the life of St Clewyd is replete
with miracles. Primary among these is the absolvement of
the sins of Gondyw at his grave. Gondyw was a cruel judge
in a land to the north who persecuted the followers of the
Pluritine Church. Such was the passion of St Clewyd’s mercy,
that Gondyw was resurrected by the power of God, to serve
as Clewyd’s most trusted disciple and eventually to become
a saint himself. Patronages: Dolmenwood, repentance,
devil-slayers, (goldsmiths), (judges).

Prayer name: Amity of St Cornice
Duration: 1 Turn per Level
Range: 360′
A writhing, 60′ diameter swarm of biting insects manifests
at a location within range.
Movement: The swarm does not move from the area it is
summoned in.
Inside the swarm: Vision is limited to 30′. Biting insects
inflict 1 damage per Round on all creatures.
Creatures of Level 1–2: Low-level creatures caught within
the swarm flee in horror and only stop when at least 240′
away.
The miracle of St Cornice of the Angels: As a maiden, Cornice
worked scrubbing the kitchens of a cruel lord. Due to her natural beauty, the lord wished to marry Cornice to his cowardly
son, but he had her cast into the dungeons after her repeated
refusals. The saint-to-be whispered to the beetles crawling
across the floor of her cell, beseeching them in the name of
the One True God to aid her. The insects obeyed, fetching ever
more of their kind, overrunning the castle. When the swarm
encroached upon the lord’s bedchambers, he relented and
had Cornice released. Patronages: Chastity, beetles, (scullery
maids).

Mossling Knacks
The curious semi-magical crafts practiced by mosslings.

M

osslings are something of a curiosity to those
sages who specialise in magic. On the surface,
they generally exhibit little aptitude for the
arcane. However, many of their kind practice inherited,
semi-magical crafts which they call knacks. It is not uncommon to see a mossling speaking with the roots of trees or
whistling to unravel knotted threads. Such deeds can only
be classified as magical, even if mosslings themselves do
not apply the term.
Knacks known: Mosslings know knacks as granted by
their Kindred (see Mossling, p48). Each knack grants a
special magical talent at Levels 1, 3, 5, and 7.

Bird friend

Over the course of a life spent in the depths of the forest
among the colonies of birds, the mossling has learned to
speak their secret languages and has earned their trust.
Bird speech (Level 1): The mossling converses with birds
and understands their replies (which are typically simplistic).
Bird companion (Level 3): The mossling can charm a bird
companion of Level 1 or less. If the bird fails a Save Versus
Spell, it remains in the company of the mossling until
dismissed. Only one bird may be charmed in this way at
a time.
Twittering message (Level 5): Once per day, forest birds
may relay a message of up to 10 words for the mossling. The
message is passed among the birds of the forest, carried
to the specified person or location at a rate of 12 miles per
hour. When it arrives at the destination, the message is
reproduced in the twitterings of the birds.
Summon flock (Level 7): Once per day, the mossling can
call upon the aid of woodland birds. A flock of sparrows,
starlings, thrushes, and blackbirds gathers and remains in
the mossling’s service for 1d4 Turns.

Flock of Birds
Medium Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral

Att Pecks and clawing (+2, 1d6) Fly 40 Morale 7 XP 40

Lock singer

The mossling studies mysterious and closely-guarded
songs which have the power to charm locks.
Open simple locks (Level 1): For every Turn the mossling
sings to a simple, mundane lock, there is a 2-in-6 chance
the device is coaxed open.
Locate key (Level 3): A brief, whispered cant persuades a
lock to reveal the location of its key (or the closest key, if
multiple exist). The information is conveyed via a quiet
whining which only the mossling comprehends.
Snap shut (Level 5): Simple, mundane locks within 30′
instantly snap shut after a single Round of song.
Open any lock (Level 7): The mossling’s song can persuade
locks of any complexity to open, with a 2-in-6 chance of
success per Turn of singing. Even magically sealed locks are
cooperative, although in this case there is a 1-in-6 chance
of the magic backfiring and sealing the mossling’s mouth
shut for 1d4 days.

Root friend

Dwelling in subterranean burrows, the mossling has developed a keen affinity with the roots of forest plants.
Root question (Level 1): Once per day, the mossling can
pose one question of a root about its surroundings. The
root answers truthfully with 1d6 words.
Summon roots (Level 3): The mossling can summon
edible roots to the surface once per day. 1d4 fresh rations
are produced.
Root respite (Level 5): The mossling may shelter in the roots
of a tree or other large plant once per day. The mossling is
taken underground into the plant’s root system, where
they may lie unnoticed for up to an hour.
Summon root thing (Level 7): The mossling can summon a
monstrous root vegetable from the earth once per day. The
creature arrives at the character’s location in 1d6 Rounds
and obeys their commands for 1d6 Turns before fleeing
into the undergrowth.

Part Five | Magic

Wood kenning­

The mossling’s fingers are sensitised to the subtle vibrations of tree and wood. By spending 1 Turn touching a
wooden item or the trunk of a tree, the mossling may glean
knowledge.
Sense history (Level 1): The mossling learns the name of
a wooden item’s creator or the name of the last person to
touch it.
Sense emotions (Level 3): The mossling discerns the most
recent strong emotion which the wood has absorbed from
a sentient being (wood is highly sensitive to such energies).
See beyond (Level 5): The mossling gains a momentary
image of what lies on the other side of a wooden barrier
(e.g. a door or wall).
True name (Level 7): The mossling learns a tree’s true
name. Once per day, the mossling may invoke one tree
whose true name they know, gaining a glimpse of the tree’s
surroundings. Invoking the true name of a deceased tree
provokes a curious vision of the vegetable afterlife.

Yeast master
Thread whistling

A mysterious whistling technique grants the mossling
sympathetic control over threads and strings within 30′.
Thread mastery (Level 1): The mossling’s whistling can
tie, untie, or unravel any textile thinner than rope: string,
laces, and the fabric of garments.
Animate threads (Level 3): The mossling commands loose
threads or strings to move as they direct. The threads may
be commanded to move up to 5′ per Round for as long as the
mossling whistles. Commanded threads do not have the
strength to attack, but do have the strength to drag small
objects (up to 20 coins of weight).
Rope mastery (Level 5): Ropes loosen or tighten at the
mossling’s command.
Animate rope (Level 7): At the mossling’s command, a rope
animates to attack and entangle foes. The mossling must
concentrate and continue to whistle while commanding
a rope—they may move at half Speed but may not attack
or perform other actions.

The mossling has a special affinity for the great mass of
yeasts and fungal spores that permeate the deep woods.
The yeast master hears the chorus of their song and counts
them as constant companions.
Ferment (Level 1): The mossling’s touch ferments sweet
liquids at a rate of one pint per Turn. The liquid is transformed to a frothy, alcoholic brew, delicious to mosslings.
There is a 2-in-6 chance of it being palatable to other folk.
Commune with yeast (Level 3): The mossling communes
with the yeasts in alcoholic beverages. Sipping from a drink
which has been partly consumed by someone else reveals
the person’s name to the mossling.
Yeasty belch (Level 5): By allowing potent yeasts to ferment
in their belly, the mossling can emit a heady belch once per
day. The belch may be targeted at an individual within 10′,
who must Save Versus Blast or faint for 1d6 Rounds.
Yeast feast (Level 7): Summoning omnipresent micro-organisms, the mossling is able to conjure a yeasty feast
equivalent to 1d6 fresh rations. The food is composed of
chunks of fleshy, compacted yeast, frothing sheets of slime,
and bubbles of alcoholic brew. Such a feast may only be
produced once per day.

Animated Rope
Small Construct—Mindless—Neutral

Level 1 AC 13 HP 1d8 (4) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att Grab (+0, entangle) Speed 30 Morale 12 XP 15
Entangle: On a successful attack, the rope wraps around
the victim. While entangled, the victim is unable to move.
The mossling may command the rope to constrict the
victim, inflicting 1d3 automatic damage per subsequent
Round.
Breaking free: Instead of attacking, an entangled victim
may Save Versus Hold to escape each Round.

“

ever mind the tricksome fairies, the perilous plants,
or the blasted standing stones. The real danger out
there in the wild is unpreparedness. And I don’t mean
just keeping your sword sharp. Without a sturdy backpack,
your gear gets wet and that torch won’t light when you find
yourself in some dank, god-forsaken place. That ball of twine
you forgot? Well, that could’ve been a tripwire around the camp
perimeter that let you know a hungry bear invited himself
to dinner. Oh, and a sprig of wolfsbane can be the difference
between life or death when you look up and notice that full
moon on a foggy autumn night.”
—Emelda Burl, human hunter

Weapon Qualities

Armour piercing: +2 Attack against targets wearing
non-magical metal armour.
Brace: When attacking a target that charged into melee
with the wielder this Round, inflicts double damage due
to bracing the weapon against the ground.
Charge: Charge attacks from a suitable mount (see Horses
and Vehicles, p120), double any damage inflicted.
Melee: Close quarters weapon, only usable within 5′ of an
opponent.
Missile: Thrown or fired weapon, only usable at greater
than 5′ from an opponent. The distances for short (+1

118

Attack), medium, and long (–1 Attack) range are shown in
parentheses.
Reach: Can be used to attack from the second rank, from
behind one or more allies in front. Incurs a –2 Attack
penalty if the ally in front is of equal size or larger than
the wielder or is using a two-handed weapon.
Reload: Can only be fired once every 2 Rounds, requiring
a Round to reload between shots.
Splash: On a successful attack, the container smashes and
douses the target with the liquid. The listed damage is
inflicted for 2 Rounds, as the liquid drips off.
Two-handed: Requires both hands to wield. The character
cannot carry anything (e.g. a shield) in the other hand.

Armour

Tailoring Armour

Bark armour: Thick layers of tough, lichen-encrusted bark,
with flexible joints of young birch bark or bottle corks laced
together. Typically only available in small size, designed
for mosslings.

Custom crafting: If armour suited to a character’s size
is not available for purchase, an armourer may be able
to craft custom-fitted armour. This has no extra cost,
but it takes 2d6 days.

Chainmail: A suit of interlocking metal rings over a backing of quilted fabric.

Adapting armour: An armourer can adapt an existing suit of armour to a character of different size. This
process takes 2d6 days and costs half the armour’s full
price. For example, tailoring a suit of human-sized
chainmail to fit a woodgrue would cost 20gp.

Full plate armour: Perfectly interlocking plates of metal
over a backing of chain mail and padding. Only the most
expert armourers can craft full plate armour, and each
suit must be tailored and balanced for a specific individual (takes 1 month). Wearing another person’s full plate
armour is awkward and only grants AC 16.
Leather armour: A breastplate of hardened leather, with
soft leather covering the rest of the body.
Pinecone armour: An intricate scale-work of hardened
pine scales threaded onto a cloth backing. Typically only
available in small size, designed for mosslings.

Weapons

Battle axe: A heavy axe with a 3′ haft.
Club: A 2–3′ length of stout wood with a heavy head.
Crossbow: A bow mounted horizontally on a wooden shaft,
with a winding mechanism to pull back the string and
nock a quarrel. May be kept in the loaded position.
Dagger: A 1′ long, two-edged blade.
Hand axe: A 2′ long hatchet suitable for use in melee or
for throwing.
Lance: A 10′ shaft of strong wood tipped with a pointed,
leaf-shaped blade. Designed for use on horseback, but may
also be used on foot.
Longbow: A bow of around the wielder’s height, typically
6′ in length. Fires arrows.
Longsword: Typically double-edged and around 3–4′ in
length.
Mace: A 2–3′ haft with a studded, flanged, or spiked head.
Polearm: A long haft (8′ or longer) tipped with a stabbing
point or slashing blade. Many types of polearms exist, but
all are treated as one weapon type for simplicity.
Shortbow: A bow of around 4′ in length. Fires arrows.
Shortsword: 2′ blades designed as thrusting and stabbing
weapons.
Sling: A strap of leather or fabric used to twirl and launch
normal stones at high speed.
Spear: A haft of strong, flexible wood, typically around 5′
long, tipped with a stabbing metal point.
Staff: A stout length of wood, typically 6–8′ long. Staves
often double as walking sticks, but those designed for
combat may be shod with metal end caps.
Two-handed sword: A great, heavy sword, 5–6′ in length.
War hammer: A 2–3′ haft tipped with a heavy metal
hammer head, often with a spike on one side.

Plate mail: Metal plates shaped to the contours of the body.
Sections of chainmail provide flexibility at the joints.
Shield: Made of metal or reinforced wood.
Unarmoured: Standard clothing.

Weapons of Special Metals
Adventurers in Dolmenwood sometimes seek out
weapons forged of cold iron or silver, as those metals
are harmful to fairies or certain undead monsters.
Time: Cold iron and silver weapons must be crafted to
special order, incurring a delay of 2d6 days.

Cold Iron Weapons
Cost: Double the weapon’s normal price.
Damage: Cold iron weapons gain a +1 damage bonus
against fairies and demi-fey, but suffer a –1 damage
penalty against other creatures. For example, a cold
iron shortsword inflicts 1d6+1 damage on a fairy or
demi-fey (rather than the standard 1d6) and 1d6–1
damage against other creatures.
Construction: Cold iron weapons are made of pure iron,
forged in flames of ancient yew wood, and doused in
water infused with mandrake root.

Silver Weapons
Cost: Ten times the weapon’s normal price.
Damage: Silver weapons inflict normal damage on all
foes, but certain foes can only be harmed by silver (or
magic) weapons.

Using Disallowed Weapons and Armour
(Optional Rule)
Characters may sometimes wish to use weapons or
armour not allowed by their Kindred or Class. This may
be handled as follows.
Weapons: –4 penalty to Attack Rolls.
Armour and shields: –2 Armour Class penalty. The
character cannot use Kindred or Class capabilities
reliant on stealth, reactions, or agility or of a magical
nature (e.g. glamours, spell casting).

Rules For Vehicles
Basic stats: Vehicles have Armour Class, Hit Points,
and Speed.
Damaging: Magic, area effects (e.g. flaming oil), and
giant monsters’ attacks inflict 1/5 normal damage.
Normal attacks (e.g. bows, claws, swords) are ineffective.
Effects of damage: A vehicle’s Speed is reduced by 10%
for every 10% of its maximum Hit Points it loses.
Repairs: Crew can repair damage up to half a vehicle’s
maximum Hit Points in the field. Full repairs require
a workshop or dock.
Cargo: Lists the maximum weight of cargo (in coins) a
vehicle can carry.
Crew / animals: Lists the number of beasts of burden,
trained sailors (see Specialist Services, p132), or
untrained characters needed to operate the vehicle.
Reduced crew: A vehicle’s Speed is reduced by 10% for
every 10% of its crew that is missing.
Passengers: Vehicles can carry passengers in place of
cargo: one Small or Medium person per 5,000 coins of
cargo space.

Water Travel
Drifting along Dolmenwood’s waterways is handled
using the normal travel rules (see Travel, p156). The
Referee tracks the party’s position along the body of
water as they travel.
Lakes: Treat as hexes with a cost of 2 Travel Points.
Rivers: Treat similarly to roads, costing 2 Travel Points
per 6 miles when travelling downstream (i.e. with the
current) and 3 Travel Points per 6 miles when travelling
upstream (i.e. against the current). On the Referee’s hex
map (DCB), rivers are annotated with 6 mile marker
points.
Hex features: The party may explore any features
along the shore in hexes they pass through.
Rest: The vessel is assumed to be docked or anchored
during rest breaks and at night.

that obscure their eyes. Dappers are favoured by the noble
classes for their curious love of dressing in preposterous
outfits and performing amusing dances.

5. Lichhound

6. Seelie Dog

Stocky, grey, wiry-furred hounds with upright, pointed
ears and narrow, yellow eyes. Lichhounds are bred by the
Church as companions for graveyard wardens and clerics
of the order of Saint Signis.

Tall, silver-furred hounds with the delicate bone structure and long legs suited for running. Seelie dogs’ eyes are
bright pink, and they are said to be of fairy ancestry.

Fear no undead: Do not check Morale when in combat with
undead monsters.
Turning bark (once a day): A lichhound may emit a baying
that is terrifying to the undead. On a 2d6 roll of 7 or more,
Level 1 undead monsters are turned, and on a roll of 9 or
more, Level 2 monster are turned. If the baying succeeds,
2d4 undead monsters flee from the hound for 1 Turn.

6. Pisker
Stocky, short-legged dogs with lustrous reddish fur, lolling tongues, and soft, pudgy bellies. Known for their
frisky, boisterous temperament and obnoxious yapping.
Commonly kept by the people of Prigwort, who fear the
presence of fairies.

Level 2 AC 11 HP 2d8 (9) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att Bite (+1, 1d6) Speed 40 Morale 8 XP 20
Detect fairies: All animals exhibit an uneasiness in the
presence of fairies. In piskers, however, this instinct is
honed to perfection. A pisker (even when sleeping) can
detect fairies within 20′ and will make their presence
known by incessantly yelping for 1 Turn.

Small Animal—Semi-Intelligent—Neutral

Language: Cannot speak, but have a basic understanding
of language (typically Woldish and Sylvan).
Loyalty: Seelies are notoriously picky about their companions—there is only a 2-in-6 chance of a seelie dog taking
to a mortal owner. If the dog dislikes the owner, it will be
utterly obstinate. If it likes the owner, it will be unfailingly
loyal.

8. Spookhound
Slender, short-haired hounds of gentle demeanour, recognisable for their white/grey coats, fluffy tails, and buggy
eyes. The spookhound was bred for the ability to detect
the presence of the undead.
Small Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral

Level 1 AC 12 HP 1d8 (4) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att Bite (+0, 1d4) Speed 40 Morale 6 XP 10

Lodgings in Dolmenwood are classified as one of three
levels of quality: poor, common, or fancy. The lodgings,
food, and services offered by an establishment depend on
its quality. The following lists describe some of the most
common dishes served in the inns and taverns of Dolmenwood. Certain establishments additionally serve their own
specialities.

Poor establishments typically have 1–2 main dishes and 1
side dish available on any given day.

Main Dishes
1. Battered pizzle: The generative organs of a slaughtered
bull, sliced up, battered, and fried. Rich and gristly stuff.
2. Blood porridge: Oat porridge with a healthy portion of
bloodworms mixed in. Some folk like their worms still
wriggling.
3. Bubble and squeak: Fried up leftovers from yesterday’s
supper. Commonly a mix of cabbage, root vegetables and
meat scraps.
4. Dregger’s pie: Acorns and sloppy mixed innards baked
in a tough pastry shell. The stench when the crust is
cracked open is said to recall the back alleys of Dreg.
5. Fisher’s gruel: Grain slop cooked in a fish-bone stock.
6. Roast wellington: Layers of leftover mash, cabbage
leaves, and chicken skin, rolled up and roasted.
7. Special pasty: Butter and sheep fat pastry encasing
meaty chunks of unknown origin. Best not to ask.
8. Woad in the hole: Crispy chicken or sparrow feet poking
out of a spongy baked batter. No actual woads’ legs are
anywhere to be seen—they are far too expensive!

Side Dishes
1. Codswallop: A putrid, off-white slop. No one is quite sure
what’s in it.
2. Pig’s ear: Crispy fried hog’s ear. Nice and hairy.
3. Sourcroute: Fermented cabbage, often accompanied by
an unwanted edge of mould.
4. Wormskin: The skins of any worms that wriggle in
the region (earthworms, bloodworms, nightworms, etc.),
fermented in strong vinegar.

and roast over a wood fire. Served with a dipping custard.

spiced jelly.
4. Longmere pike: A whole pike, stuffed with leek and sage,
served with fresh forest greens.
5. Maids-o’-the-lake: A Dolmenwood delicacy: thigh-sized,
translucent pink squid fried in garlic butter. Many inns
refuse to serve this dish on nights of the full moon, as it is
said to attract the attention of witches.
6. Roast lurkey: Juicy flesh of the notoriously elusive
Dolmenwood game bird.

7. Unicorn rump: Tender venison of the deer-like beasts
known as false unicorns. The flesh of true unicorns may
only be served at the duke’s table.

preserved in sweet jelly.
2. Old Shuck: Rigid slices of stinking, ultra-mature cheese
of mossling manufacture.
3. Sparrey: A melt-in-the-mouth confection of crispy,
sugared moth wings.

from the moss-gardens of Dolmenwood trolls.

Teas

For each measure of an alcoholic drink consumed,

character has reached the next level of inebriation.

1. Tipsy: The effects noted in the beverage’s description become appreciable. The character suffers a –1
penalty to Attack Rolls.
2. Drunk: The effects noted in the beverage’s description are in full effect. The character suffers a –1
penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws and gains
1d4 bonus Hit Points (these can increase the character’s current HP total above the normal maximum).
Damage is subtracted first from the bonus Hit Points.
Any remaining bonus Hit Points are lost once Sober.
3. Groggy: The effects noted in the beverage’s description are in full effect. The character suffers a –2
penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws. Any
bonus Hit Points gained at the Drunk level remain.
4. Unconscious: The character passes out.

An inebriated character who ceases to drink loses one
level of inebriation every 2 hours.

final fermentation is famed for exquisitely robust flavour,
with undertones of lemon zest and mead. Effect: Overindulgence causes an embarrassingly rapid dissolution of
muscle control.

Encumbrance: One smoke of pipeleaf weighs 1 coin.

Pipes

1. Bog-oak pipe: A hard, black pipe carved from wood
dredged out of a peat bog. The sombre faces of ancient
bog-denizens can be spied drifting in the smoke. Said to
be the favoured pipe of wizards of all kinds.
2. Cherry-wood pipe: A fine pipe of carved cherry, producing a smooth, aromatic smoke.
3. Clay pipe: A common pipe of fired clay, often inscribed
with motifs, symbols, or script.
4. Gourd pipe: A curiously shaped, colourful gourd with
a curved stem and a plump bowl. Favoured by mosslings,
who craft gourd pipes in their hidden communities.

Availability

Lists the chance that an item is available in a settlement
when sought. Leaf may be purchased from tavernkeeps or
wandering pedlars specialising in the trade.

Pipeleaf

1. Barley Blend: Finely chopped, golden-brown leaf with
malty undertones and a smooth, sweet taste. A cheap leaf,
favoured by farmers and ploughmen. Effect: Aids digestion
after a heavy meal.
2. Burglar’s Blend: A stringy, rough-cut mix of black and
chestnut brown leaves. Its coarse, bonfire aroma makes
it an acquired taste. Effect: Keeps one awake in the dead
of night.
3. Crofter’s Daughter: A soft, auburn-hued leaf. Its smooth
aroma carries a note of citrus. A homely leaf, beloved of
townsfolk. Effect: Makes one feel happy with one’s lot.
4. Dusty Abbot: An ultra-fine dust (can also be taken as
a snuff) of purplish-brown hue. Produces a cool, refined
smoke with the odour of rosewood and the taste of cherry.
Favoured by the noble classes. Effect: Elicits a state of jovial
eloquence.
5. Fatty Lumper: Uncut leaves, crumbled roughly. Tastes
sweet and nutty, smells of elderberries. Effect: Brings on
a ravenous appetite.
6. Flufftop: A soft, furry, golden leaf, roughly cut, glistening
with fragments of crystalline pollen. Produces a thick,
greenish smoke with a heady aroma of spice. Favoured by
Grimalkin. Some say this leaf originated in Catland. Effect:
Brings on a state of light-hearted whimsy.
7. Gamgy Weed: Slivered, semi-dried leaf of brown-green
hue. The pungent aroma has an off-putting edge of ammonia, but the smoke is smooth and floral. Effect: Causes a
heavy sleepiness.
8. The Gibbet’s Gift: Ashen white dust. Produces an exceptionally thin, penetrating smoke that seeps across the
ground. The smoke is almost odourless, but tastes strongly
of gravy. Effect: Smoking this pipeleaf aids one in following
through with unpleasant decisions.
9. Green Jenny: Raw, rolled leaves of a variety that will
burn undried. The smoke is thin and astringent, but the
taste is sublime, with notes of apple and walnut. Effect:
Smoking this leaf in excessive quantities causes one’s
vision to take on a green tinge.

Smoking (Optional Rule)
The many pipeleafs listed in this section are assumed
to simply add flavour to the campaign world, without
having any specific mechanical effect. Groups that wish
the smoking of pipeleaf to take on a more functional
(and therefore perhaps more prominent) role in the
campaign may use the following rule.

Quiet Contemplation
When vexed by a problem, a character may sit down,
get out their pipe, and spend an hour smoking in quiet
contemplation or in debate with companions.
If the hour passes undisturbed, the player may make
an Intelligence Check. If several characters smoke and
debate together, the most intelligent character makes
the check, with a +1 bonus per 2 companions (maximum of +2). If the check succeeds, the Referee gives the
player a clue about the problem being contemplated.

What is Pipeleaf?
The origin and nature of pipeleaf are left to the Referee’s
discretion. In some campaigns, pipeleaf may be tobacco
as we know it in the real world. In others, it may be an
entirely different plant, native to the Dolmenwood
region.

10. Lanksbottom Leaf: Chopped almost to dust, this
common pipeleaf is near black in colour and has a robust,
chocolate aroma. Grown in the warm valleys of the southern High Wold. The favoured smoke of lower class breggles.
Effect: Brings on a state of merry arrogance.
11. Mogglemoss: Rich, green curls that produce a smouldering, emerald smoke. The aroma is of springtime, the
taste of cheese and onion. Favoured by woodgrues, scrabies, and (rumour has it) the Drune. Effect: Causes an introspective state in which the obscure may become clear.
12. Mummer’s Farce: A finely shredded, oak-brown leaf
with fibrous hairs. Favoured by gamblers, its pungent,
nutmeg aroma lingers in the taverns of Dreg. Effect:
Inspires jollity and hijinks.
13. Old Doby: Sumptuous, velvety, red-brown leaf with
an aroma reminiscent of the woods in autumn. Old Doby
is regarded by many as the forefather of all varieties of
pipeleaf. A common but well-loved leaf. Effect: Calms the
nerves and lightens the spirit.
14. Pedlar Puff: A rich, densely packed, sticky leaf, lustrous
near-black in colour. The smoke is thick and cloying, the
aroma like that of summer rain. Effect: Smoking this pipeleaf enhances the determination of foot-travellers whose
destination still lies far away.

15. Special Shag: Rich, moist, finely-cut leaf of dark,
reddish-brown hue. The refined aroma carries notes of
plum blossom. Bears the Ducal seal of approval. Effect:
Enhances good judgement in trying times.
17. Speckled Wyrm: A blend of greyish, rough-cut leaf with
strands of silver. The taste is hoppy; the smoke is woody
and is speckled with glittering, silver motes. Effect: Brings
about a state of intent concentration.
18. Wayside Wisp: A fine, supple leaf of silvery hue.
Produces coils and spirals of violet smoke, smelling of
lavender. This rare and refined leaf is said to be cultivated
in Fairy. Effect: Smoking it brings on a state of wonder
and glee.
19. Westling’s Weed: Dense, fibrous leaf of copper-red
hue. Imported from the distant west. Produces a heavy,
dark smoke with the odour of smoked fish. Effect: Inspires
dreams of travel and adventure.
20. Witch’s Shag: A blend of yellow and purplish leaves,
finely cut. The smoke is smooth and fruity. Effect: Inspires
a pleasant dizziness.

21. Shaggy Pony: A stringy, oat-brown leaf that smells of
horse. The smoke is sweet (and also horsey) and tastes of
baked tomato. Effect: Aids deep and restful sleep.

Encumbrance: Each portion of a fungus or herb weighs 4 coins.

Availability

Lists the chance that an item is available in a settlement
when sought (typically from a herbalist or apothecary).

Common Fungi and herbs

1. Arrowhame: Tiny, dried leaves of a climbing plant. Rehydrated and applied as a paste to diseased flesh, grants a
Save Versus Doom against a disease of magical origin.
If the save succeeds, the disease recedes within 1d3 days.
Repeat applications of Arrowhame are ineffective.
2. Blood Canker: Rust-red dried residue of a slime-mould
prevalent in Mulchgrove. Mixed with alcohol and drunk,
cures 1d3 Hit Points. Each usage of Blood Canker has a 2-in-6
chance of permanently reducing the character’s Constitution by 1.
3. Bosun’s Balm: Roots dredged up from a rare river weed.
Eaten at breakfast, the herb stimulates the body’s energies,
bringing on great endurance for one day. For encumbrance
purposes, the effective weight of the character’s armour
is reduced by 50% or by one bulk category, depending on
the encumbrance rules in use. See Encumbrance, p148.
4. Fenob: The root-bulbs of a forest flower. A bulb of Fenob
placed under the tongue before bed causes the character
to recover extra 1 Hit Point if a good night’s rest is had.

130

5. Gillywort: A finely ground, white powder derived from
the leaves of a creeper that favours dank cave-mouths.
When the powder is added to liquid, there is a 3-in-6 chance
that it turns a shocking purple in the presence of poison. A
dose of Gillywort is enough to test one liquid.
6. Grue’s Ear: Rubbery, pink ear fungus. Consuming a specimen brings on a mild psychedelia wherein the character’s
vision is tinged pink and they become sensitive to bright
light. The character’s alertness is also enhanced, granting
a 3-in-6 chance of being able to act during a Surprise Round
when their party is surprised (see Encounters, p164 for
full details on surprise). These effects last for 2d6 Turns.
Grue’s Ear loses its potency with repeated use—after each
usage, there is a 2-in-6 chance that the character henceforth requires an extra dose to gain a noticeable effect.
7. Hogscap: Mottled, fist-sized puffballs, harvested in
their plump, immature stage. Consumption brings on a
woozy state of mild psychedelia, with wobbling vision and
hallucinations of distant wails and keening. The character
suffers a –1 penalty to Attack Rolls but gains the ability to
sense magical influence in any object touched for 1 Turn.
The effects last for 1d6 hours.
8. Lankswith: Powdered root of a floating pond weed. Taken
as a tea with supper, cures common ailments overnight.

Pa r t Si x | Equipmen t, Serv ices , a nd A nim a l s

9. Lilywhite: Carefully dried and folded petals of a marsh
lily. Smoking the petals in a pipe brings on a deep, soporific
state that aids sleep in harsh conditions. Smoked before
bed, the character gains a +1 bonus to any Constitution
Checks required to rest (see Camping, p158).
10. Marshwick: The seeds of a scarce and unremarkable
marsh flower, ground into a blue powder. A character
afflicted by a poison of animal origin who drinks a dose of
Marshwick with a swig of wine may Save Versus Doom. If
the save succeeds, the venom is neutralised. Repeat doses
are ineffective.
11. Moonhaw: Pale white berries of a thorny bush, only
harvested at night under the light of the moon. 1 Turn after
chewing a handful of the berries, the character gains the
ability to see normally up to 10′ in utter blackness. The
effects are short-lived, only lasting for 3 Turns.
12. Ofteritch: A black liquid fermented from the young
roots of the lantern elm. A character afflicted by a poison
of plant origin who drinks a dose of Ofteritch may Save
Versus Doom. If the save succeeds, the poison is neutralised. Repeat doses are ineffective.
13. Sallow Parsley: Silvery-leafed young shoots of a rare
fern, which look uncannily like the culinary herb parsley.
On a day spent resting in safety, a character who drinks an
infusion of this herb throughout the day will recover 2 Hit
Points, in addition to the normal healing due to rest (see
Rest and Healing, p160).
14. Smottlebread: Spongy, green, bread-like hunks of giant
mushroom flesh. Consuming a chunk of Smottlebread
causes a trance state lasting 1d6 Turns, during which the
character enters into communion with the spirit of the
Smottlebread—a gargantuan, benevolent, elephantine
entity formed of green spheres. While the trance lasts,
the character is completely immobilised. Following the
trance, the character’s vision is tinged green and their
coordination is fuddled (–1 penalty to melee Attack Rolls,
–2 penalty to missile Attack Rolls). Contact with the fungal
spirit steels the character’s mind, granting them a +2 bonus
to Saving Throws against effects of magical origin. Posttrance effects last for 1d6 Turns.
15. Spirithame: Delicate, curled leaves of a rare moss.
When crushed and applied to wounds, cures 1d2 Hit Points.
Spirithame loses its effectiveness quickly—a character only
benefits from one dose per day.
16. Tom-a-Merry: Tiny, cute mushrooms as tall as a baby’s
finger, with pointy blue caps. Consuming a dose of Tom-aMerry induces a hallucinatory state where time lurches
and becomes distorted. The character suffers a –2 penalty
to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws and, in combat, always
acts last in the Round. The character also gains the ability
to see invisible objects and creatures. The effects last for
1d6 Turns.

Foraging
When PCs forage in Dolmenwood, in addition to
finding food, they may also come across interesting
mushrooms or herbs. These may include the useful
varieties listed here and other less well-known species
that grow in the wild reaches of the Wood. The Referee
determines the types of mushrooms or herbs found,
depending on the region of the Wood being explored.

Identifying Specimens
The species of fungi and herbs listed here are common
enough that all adventurers can identify them. Other
species require the services of a herbalist. See p161.

Selling Foraged Specimens
Herbalists and apothecaries are often interested in
purchasing herbs or mushrooms foraged from the
woods. See p161.
17. Wallowmost: Fluffy yellow buds of a spring plant that
flowers in Mulchgrove. A character afflicted by a poison of
fungal origin who chews and swallows a dose of Wallowmost may Save Versus Doom. If the save succeeds, the
poison is neutralised. Repeat doses are ineffective.
18. Wayfarrow: Desiccated red berries of a thorny bush.
Chewing the berries throughout the day brings on great
vigour and stamina when marching. If the character
engages in a forced march, they have a 3-in-6 chance of
being fit for action the following day, without the usual
penalties for not resting (see Travel, p156).
19. Witch’s Oyster: Miniature, bright violet oyster mushrooms that grow in high tree branches. Boiling a portion
and drinking the water induces a visionary trance lasting
1d4 hours. Upon awakening, the character gains an oracular insight into a topic that puzzles them. The Referee
should describe the insight to the player, determining its
accuracy by rolling 1d6: 1–2: the insight is entirely apposite
and truthful, 3–4: the insight hints at the truth in a mysterious manner, 5–6: the insight is entirely misleading.
20. Wolfsbane: Long sprigs of purple flowers. Werewolves
find Wolfsbane repulsive, but the bloom is odourless to
others. A werewolf must make a successful Save Versus
Doom each Round in order to make a melee attack against
someone decorated with sprigs of Wolfsbane.

Retainers
Stalwart companions for journeys into places drear.

A

dventurers often require extra assistance
when journeying into the unknown, whether a
doughty fighter to guard the rear or an extra pair
of hands to hold a torch against the dark. Such characters
are classified as retainers—NPCs hired to accompany characters on their adventures.

Applicants

Limit per PC: Each retainer is in the employ of a specific
PC, acting under their orders. The maximum number of
retainers that will work for a PC at any one time is 4 + the
character’s Charisma Modifier.

Locating Potential
Retainers

Potential retainers may be located by frequenting inns and
pubs or by paying to post notices of help wanted.

rounds and greasing palms in drinking establishments
costs 50gp. Per attempt, there is a 3-in-6 chance of successfully locating applicants (see Applicants).
Posting notices of help wanted: Spending a day posting
notices in public places costs 25gp. Per attempt, there is a
2-in-6 chance of successfully locating applicants (see Applicants). They apply at the specified location 1d4 days later.
Repeated searches: Each method of locating applicants
may only be tried periodically, depending on the size of
settlement: in hamlets and villages, each method may be
used once a month; in small towns, once a week; in large
towns, twice a week; in cities, once a day.

When a search for potential retainers succeeds, roll on the
Applicants by Settlement Size table.

Offering Wages

Shares of Treasure

Once an applicant has been located, the hiring PC must
explain what the job entails and offer a certain wage.
Townsfolk expect a daily rate of pay, while adventurers
ask for a share of any treasure recovered.

Applicant Reaction
The applicant’s reaction to the offer is determined by rolling on the Hiring Reactions table, modified as follows.
Charisma: The hiring PC’s Charisma Modifier is applied to
the Hiring Reactions roll.
Reputation: A penalty of –1 or –2 may be applied, if the
hiring PC has a bad reputation in the local area.

Fractional shares of treasure are calculated by dividing
the treasure by the total number of shares. For example, a party consisting of 5 PCs (full shares) plus one
retainer (paid a half share) discover 2,750gp of treasure. The total is divided by 5.5 (five full shares plus one
half share): 500gp. Thus, each PC gains 500gp and the
retainer gains 250gp.

Retainer Loyalty

A retainer’s Loyalty rating reflects their willingness to stick
by PCs in the face of danger. Loyalty is initially equal to 7
+ the hiring character’s Charisma Modifier, but it may be
adjusted as follows.
Bonuses: Saving a retainer from danger or granting generous treasure rewards may increase Loyalty.
Penalties: Ill-treatment of a retainer or lack of treasure
may decrease Loyalty.

Loyalty Checks

Generosity: Above or below standard wages incur a modifier to the roll, as listed in the Typical Wages table.

Circumstances arise that test a retainer’s loyalty to their
employer. For example, an enemy may try to bribe a
retainer to betray their employer, or a retainer may be
tempted to flee from a situation of great peril.

Bonus payments: Offering to buy equipment for the applicant or give them a sum of money up front may increase
the generosity modifier by 1 (up to a maximum +2 generosity bonus).

Rolling a Loyalty check: In such situations, the Referee
should roll 2d6. If the roll is lower than or equal to the
retainer’s Loyalty, the check succeeds and the retainer
remains true to the hiring PC.

HIRING REACTIONS
2d6

Reaction

Angry refusal. Hiring reaction rolls for other
applicants present suffer a –1 penalty

Uncertain. Will accept an improved offer

Unsuccessful Adventures
Optionally, the Referee may also make Loyalty checks
following unsuccessful adventures. If such a check fails,
the retainer decides to leave the PC’s employ and seek their
fortune elsewhere.

Retainer Advancement
Townsfolk

Role-Playing Retainers
While retainers are individuals with their own personalities, desires, and goals, it can be cumbersome to roleplay them in detail. This is especially acute when a party
contains multiple retainers.
A common approach is for the player of the hiring character to describe retainers’ actions, essentially running
them as secondary Player Characters. The Referee may
occasionally interject, if they wish to add role-playing
elements or feel the described actions do not fit the
retainer’s personality.

Retainers as Replacement PCs

As non-adventurers without a Class, townsfolk do not earn
Experience Points and do not gain Levels. The Referee may
sometimes “promote” long-serving townsfolk to a suitable
adventuring Class.

Adventurers
Adventurers earn Experience Points and advance in Level
in the same way as Player Characters (see Advancement,
p25), but all XP a retainer earns is halved. This is because
retainers generally follow instructions from PCs, rather
than being directly involved in decision making.
Gaining Levels: When a retainer advances in Level and
reaches equal or greater Level than the hiring PC, they typically leave employment to go on adventures of their own.

If a Player Character perishes during an adventure, a
retainer may optionally be promoted to a full PC. This
can provide instant replacements even during the
course of an adventure.

Basic Game Procedure
The basic sequence of play fundamental to a role-playing game.

W

hether adventurers are exploring the tangled
wilds, delving into ancient barrows, or browsing market stalls for equipment, the same
basic sequence of play applies.

The Basic Game Procedure
1. Description: The Referee describes the situation
adventurers find themselves in, depicting the
environment, any characters, monsters, hazards,
or objects present, and noting prominent smells,
sounds, etc.
2. Clarification: The players may ask questions of the
Referee to clarify any descriptive elements that are
unclear to them.
3. Action: Putting themselves in their characters’
shoes, the players discuss what to do. This could be
anything imaginable, from speaking with characters
or monsters present, to investigating or interacting
with objects or hazards, to using special capabilities
granted by their Kindred or Class.
4. Judgement: The Referee judges the result of the
proposed action, using their knowledge of the situation. Specific game rules may apply, or the Referee
may make a ruling on the specific situation.
5. Resolution: The action is resolved, making any
applicable dice rolls. Play then returns to step 1, as
the Referee describes what happens next.

Description

The Referee acts as the eyes and ears of the Player Characters, relaying to the players what their characters can see,
hear, smell, and feel in the imagined game world.
Overview: When PCs initially enter an area or encounter a
creature, the Referee should give an overview of the situation and what PCs perceive. All obvious objects, creatures,
and environmental features should be mentioned. Not
everything need be described in great depth, as players
are free to ask the Referee for more detail on specifics that
catch their interest.
More detail: The Referee may sometimes mention that PCs
cannot perceive something in great detail, drawing attention to something players may wish to investigate further.
For example, PCs see a door with a sign in the distance and
the Referee says “You see a sign on the door, but you’ll need
to get closer to read the writing.”
Hidden things: Objects or creatures that are concealed
should not be immediately described. Such things may
only be discovered if PCs search in the right area.

138

Clarification

After listening to the Referee’s overview of the current
situation, players may ask questions to clarify what the
PCs perceive. The Referee should answer such questions
based on the PCs’ vantage point and senses.
Urgency: When an urgent threat is present, the Referee
may limit the amount of detail presented, as PCs do not
have time to look around.
No actions: The Referee should only provide additional
detail in response to questions that do not require movement or other actions. Questions that would require PCs
to change their vantage point or interact with objects are
handled in the next step, Action.

Action

The players imagine themselves in the situation presented
by the Referee, consider it from the perspective of their
characters, and decide what to do. This is known as
role-playing.
Discussion: Presented with a puzzling or challenging situation, players may wish to discuss the best course of action,
weighing up various possibilities. This can be a very engaging part of play, as long as player indecision does not cause
the game to drag out and become tedious.
Urgency: When an urgent threat is present, the Referee
may limit the time players are allowed to discuss, or may
even simply ask each player in turn what they wish to do,
without the chance for discussion among the group.
Player knowledge: It is important to distinguish between
what a player knows and what their character knows. Players should be careful to only use their character’s knowledge when making decisions.
Multiple actions: If the players wish, each character may
do something different, though it is usually wise for the
party to stick together and act in concert.
Conversations and voice acting: Some groups greatly
enjoy playing out elaborate conversations with NPCs or
other PCs, acting out quirky character mannerisms and
voices. Other groups prefer to give a broad description
of what is said, rather than acting out every word. Both
approaches are fine and can even be mixed (e.g. one player
may act in character while another describes what their
character says).

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Judgement

Is a Roll Warranted?

Referee judgement: When a situation arises that is not
explicitly covered by the rules, the Referee should clarify
with the players their intended approach and then make
a ruling about what happens.

Description: Does the player’s description of how they
intend to approach the task sound feasible?

This book presents the core rules and procedures of the
game, including rules for handling the most common
adventuring situations. These rules are, however, only a
starting point—they do not cover all possible eventualities
that might emerge during play.

Automatic success: In some situations—especially when
no inherent danger is involved—the Referee may simply
declare that the characters succeed without a roll of any
kind. See Is a Roll Warranted?
Automatic failure: Similarly, there are situations where
what characters are attempting is simply impossible. When
no amount of skill, perseverance, or even luck would avail,
the Referee should inform the player that what they wish
to attempt is impossible.
Ability Checks: In situations where a character’s Abilities—for example, their Strength or Dexterity—are the
main deciding factor in success, an Ability Check may be
appropriate. See p22 for examples of some situations
that may be handled by an Ability Check.
Chances: In situations where a specific Ability plays no role
or where sheer luck is the deciding factor, the Referee may
judge a chance of success (e.g. as a percentage or an X-in-6
roll—see Chance Rolls, p15) and have the player roll.
Presenting the odds: When a character’s action has a
chance of failure, the Referee should make this clear before
asking players if they wish to proceed. Knowing the likelihood of success or failure, players may alter their approach
or come up with alternative plans to tip the odds in their
favour.
Group discussion: It is recommended that the Referee
openly discuss their thought process when making judgements. Players should not be allowed to dominate the
Referee’s decisions, but asking for input fosters an atmosphere of openness and fairness.

The Referee must judge which situations warrant a roll
of some kind (e.g. a Skill Check, Ability Check, or Saving
Throw) and which do not. For tasks with no inherent
danger and no time pressure, PCs with appropriate
skills and tools should generally succeed automatically.
As a general guideline, consider the following points.

Skill: Does the PC have the required skill to perform the
task? Characters with a specific background, Kindred,
or Class may be more suited to the task than others.
Note that all adventurers are assumed to have basic
skills of dungeon and outdoor exploration (e.g. using
ropes, lighting fires, mapping, etc.)—see Adventurer
Competency, p150.
Tools: Does the PC have any tools required for the task?
Time: Is there any time pressure?
Danger: Is there any inherent danger in failure?

Customising Rules
None of the rules presented in this book are written
in stone. If the players and Referee wish, any rule may
be expanded, altered, or removed. Such tweaks to the
rules are known as house rules—many groups end up
with their own unique way of playing, tailored to their
particular tastes.
That said, the rules have been carefully designed and
very thoroughly battle tested. Many groups will be
perfectly happy with the rules as written.
New players: Those new to the game are encouraged to
use the rules as written and establish personal tastes
before making alterations.

Resolution

Any required die rolls are made, according to the Referee’s
judgement in the previous step. The play sequence then
begins again, as the Referee describes what happens next.
Time passing: Resolving characters’ actions usually causes
time in the imaginary world to pass. The time that passes
depends on the action taken. For example, attempting to
pick a lock requires 1 Turn (approximately 10 minutes),
while pushing open an unlocked door requires mere
seconds. The Referee should keep track of time in the game
as PC actions cause it to advance. See Time and Movement,
p146 for more details on tracking time.

Example of Play
Demonstrating the basic procedures of adventuring in the wilds.

E

mily (playing Grendl Lockehorn, a Level 3 breggle
knight), James (playing Samwise Lank, a Level
3 human friar), and Jeff (playing Boots Pouncemouse, a Level 3 grimalkin enchanter) are camping in the
wild woods after having fled from a band of goblins in
the night. Let’s listen in as Gavin, the Referee, narrates
the scene and follows the travel procedure (p156) to see
what happens.
Gavin (Referee): You awake at dawn, after a fitful night’s
sleep in your hastily set up camp site. You now discover
what the spiky stuff underfoot was: you’re camping in a
glade of holly trees. As you didn’t get a full night’s sleep,
I’m afraid you’re all exhausted today. That’s a –1 penalty to
Attack and Damage Rolls. <Rolls on the seasonal weather
table in the DCB> Dappled sunlight glimmers down
through the forest canopy. It seems like it’s going to be a
clement day. Baby Rosemary is stirring and grumbling.
What’s your course of action for the day?
James (playing Samwise): We need to get back to a village
as quickly as we can. Rosemary isn’t ready for a life of
adventure. We’re not entirely sure where we are though.
Any ideas anyone?
Emily (playing Grendl): I say we head south. When we set
off from <checks notes> the village of Lobwall we were
heading north. So south should take us back that way.
Jeff (playing Boots): I was thinking the same. Much as I
don’t relish returning to that backwater dive, I want to rid
ourselves of this mewling infant as soon as possible.
Gavin: Sounds good. You have a quick breakfast and break
camp. Cross off a day’s rations everyone. Your party’s Speed
is 20 (due to Grendl’s heavy armour), so you have 4 Travel
Points today. <Rolls to see if the party gets lost—a 2-in-6
chance in hilly forest. A roll of 3 indicates that they do not
get lost, so they travel south as planned.> After a couple
of hours’ travel through rugged knolls and holly thickets,
you hear the distant sound of hunting horns on the wind.
Emily: Uh oh. Could that be our goblin friends?
James: We’d better not hang around to find out. Let’s keep
moving.
Gavin: OK you keep heading south. You hear distant horn
blasts a few more times, but they don’t seem to be getting
any closer. <Consulting the DCB’s description of the hex
the party is moving into> By midday the ground is flattening out and you no longer hear the hunting horns. You
do notice an increasing number of trees with unsettlingly
eye- and mouth-like whorls on their trunks. You get the
feeling the forest itself is watching you. You’re heading into
an area of tangled forest, so that uses up 3 Travel Points.
You now have 1 left today.
Jeff (as Boots): “Hey trees, if you let us pass unharmed we
promise to give you some really nice... er... water to drink!”

140

Emily: Do we?
Jeff: Just trying to ingratiate ourselves to the locals.
Gavin: You don’t get any response from the trees. Do you
want to investigate or talk with one more closely?
James: No! We keep going.
Gavin: Alright. Late in the afternoon you come across a
road heading roughly east-west. <Decides to roll the daily
check for a random encounter at this point—a 2-in-6
chance in tangled forest. He rolls a 1—an encounter occurs!
Rolling on the encounter tables in the DCB indicates an
encounter with 7 false unicorns—a common game animal.
Gavin starts following the encounters procedure—p164.
Neither party has any prior awareness of the other, so
they’ll need to roll for surprise.>
Jeff: Great, looks like we’re on the right track. Civilisation
here we come! Well, if ten mud huts or whatever it was
counts as civilisation. But which way do we go?
Emily: No idea. <To Gavin> Do we recognise this stretch
of road?
Gavin: No. It doesn’t immediately seem familiar, but then
there’d have to be something pretty distinctive for you to
remember a random stretch of forest road. While you’re
contemplating which way to go, something approaches.
Roll for surprise! <Rolls to see if the false unicorns are
surprised. A roll of 1 indicates they’re unaware of the PCs.>
Emily: Uh oh. I’ll roll. 3! We’re not surprised.
Gavin: <Rolls to see how far away the false unicorns are.
210′, a little way down the road.> Alright. You hear something from the east. It sounds like hooves coming along
the road in your direction.
James (as Samwise): “Quick everyone, hide, someone’s
coming!” We can emerge if they look friendly.
Gavin: You find a nice thick tree trunk to duck behind
where you can peek out and view the road.
Jeff: I quietly nock a quarrel in my crossbow.
James: I give Rosemary a biscuit from my rations to keep
her occupied and quiet.
Gavin: You wait a minute in your hiding place, peeking out
occasionally. The sound of cantering hooves approaches. It
sounds like a small group of horses. Shortly, they round the
bend and you get a glimpse of them—seven white horselike creatures with horns on their foreheads.
Emily, James, and Jeff: Unicorns!
Gavin: As Grendl gets a closer look at them, she realises
they’re not unicorns. They’re a common, deer-like game
animal known as false unicorns. They had you fooled for
a moment.
Emily: Ohhh. I would have loved to meet unicorns.
Anyway, I guess we just let them go past. No need to try
to hunt them.

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

James: Maybe we should follow behind them though. A
glimpse of a unicorn (even a false one) is auspicious.
Gavin: Sounds good. So you go back down to the road and
head west. Now you’re travelling on a road, you can move
3 miles per Travel Point. You have 1 left today, so you can
travel 3 miles west. <Looking at the hex map in the DCB>
As the afternoon wears on to dusk, you find yourselves
in a woodland where the trees are festooned with dainty
flowers glowing ochre, lilac, and mauve in the rapidly
diminishing light.
Emily: Now this seems familiar. <Checks notes> Oh! Yes,
that village Lobwall was in these woods with the little
glowing flowers. We must be close.
Gavin: Unfortunately you’ve travelled as far as you can
today. You’ll need to start setting up camp. Unless you
want to press on and see if you can make it to the village?
That would count as a forced march. <Consulting the travel
rules—p156> A full day of forced marching increases
your daily Travel Points by 50%, so you would have had
a total of 6. <Making a ruling for the situation at hand>
I guess if you wanted to forced march now, we could say
you get 1 extra Travel Point. You’d be travelling in the
dark, though, and you’d have to rest all day tomorrow or
be exhausted.
Emily: Hmm, 1 Travel Point, so that would be 3 miles. We
don’t have any idea how far it is to Lobwall, so it’s risky. We
might still end up having to set up camp in the wilds. And
in the middle of the night. What do you think guys?
James: I say we camp. That way we can get settled in a good
location and hopefully get a good night’s sleep. Unlike last
night.
Jeff (as Boots): “Sounds good! I’ve got some very special
treats for you mortal folk too. Special fairy snacks to ease
the troubles of the road.”
Gavin (to Jeff): Your Conjure Treats glamour? Remember
those don’t provide actual sustenance...
Jeff: Sure, they won’t know the difference though.
Gavin: OK so you start looking for a good place to camp.
Do you want to camp on the road, beside the road, or some
way into the woods?
James: I’d say a little way into the woods, so anyone coming
along the road can’t see our campfire.
Emily: But wouldn’t we be more likely to encounter
friendly folk closer to the road?
James: I don’t think anyone friendly is going to be travelling along the road in the dead of night. I’m still concerned
those goblins or their ‘Master’ might be looking for us.
Emily: Right, true. A bit into the woods then. <Jeff nods in
agreement.>
Gavin: Alright, so you head a short distance into the woods
north of the road and look around for a good spot. You find
a nice little clearing, ringed with those glowing flower trees
and carpeted with soft ferns. <Consulting the camping
rules—p158> What setup activities do you all want to do?
James: Well, we’re going to need some firewood. Maybe
Samwise can set up the campsite and look after Rosemary
while you two go looking for some dry wood? <Emily and
Jeff nod in agreement.>

Gavin: Sounds good. <Deciding today’s clement weather
means there’s no penalty to finding dry wood> Emily and
Jeff, roll 1d6 each to see how many hours’ worth of firewood
you manage to forage while Samwise sets up the campsite.
Emily: I got a 1. Sorry guys, I’m a knight. I have servants to
do this stuff for me. Or I should anyway.
Jeff: And I got a 6!
Gavin: So that’s 7 hours total. Not quite enough for the full
night, but close enough. You reconvene at the campsite,
which Samwise has now got prepared with your bedrolls
laid out and a place for a fire. What camp activities do you
want to do?
James: I’ll cook a meal. I have my cooking pots. Plus I still
have some of those tasty cured sausages we got from Dreg.
Jeff: And while he cooks I’ll entertain you all with gripping
tales of my days as a spy in the courts of Catland!
Emily and James: No! Remember what happened last time
you tried that? We couldn’t get that stupid song out of our
heads and no one got a good night’s rest.
Jeff: Boots is crestfallen. No special fairy treats for you.
Gavin: Alright, James make a Wisdom Check to see how
your cooking goes.
James: <Rolls 1d6> Great, I got a 5, plus my Wisdom Modifier
that’s a 7. Definitely a successful meal!
Gavin: Yep, you cook up some of the sausages along with
the rest of your day’s rations into a super tasty stew. You all
get a +1 to any Constitution Checks at sleeping time. So if
there’s nothing else, let’s see if anything eventful happens
in the night. Do you use the same watches?
Emily: Yep. So that’s Grendl on first watch, Boots on second
watch, and Samwise on third watch.
Gavin: OK great. You’ve got your bedrolls and a campfire
but no tents. It’s springtime. <Consults the camping rules—
p158> That means you all get a good night’s sleep. No roll.
James: Nice. I want to pray for spells in the morning.
Gavin: <Rolls for a nighttime random encounter—a
2-in-6 chance in tangled forest. He rolls a 5—no encounter.> Alright, the night passes uneventfully. You awake
refreshed—a great relief after your broken sleep the night
before. <Rolls weather for the coming day> It looks like the
warm weather of yesterday is set to continue.
James: Excellent. I say my morning prayers before breakfast. I’ll pray for Lesser Healing, Mantle of Protection, and
Silence.
Gavin: <Knows one of the leaders of the band of goblins—
an elf knight—has been following the party. Gavin has
tracked his progress on the map and judges that he now
has a 2-in-6 chance of spotting the smoke from the party’s
campfire in the early morning. A roll of 1 on a d6 indicates
that he’s closing in.> Cool, so you finish your prayers and
the others are breaking camp and having breakfast. Roll
for surprise!
Emily, James, and Jeff: Oh no!
James: I’ll roll. 6! We’re not surprised.
Gavin: You catch the scent of freshly cut roses and hear
the padding of feet as a huge dormouse with a strangely
armoured rider charges out of the trees at you...

Preparing for an
Adventure
Advice for players on successful adventuring.

B

efore leaving the comfort of the fireside and heading into the wilds, certain preparatory steps are
essential for successful adventuring.

The Adventuring Party

The first and most fundamental requirement for going
adventuring is the gathering of a group of like-minded
companions willing to venture forth into the unknown.
Typically, a party consists of one character per player, but
the following points should also be borne in mind.
Size: The ideal size of a group is around 6 characters—large
enough to confront the challenges of an adventure, while
not so large as to become disorganised. If not enough PCs
are present, the players may wish to hire retainers (see
p134). The Referee may also allow experienced players
to run two Player Characters at once.

Player Roles

To ensure the game runs smoothly, it can be helpful to
assign certain important roles to individual players. Player
roles may be assigned on a permanent basis, if players
wish, or may be rotated between sessions.

Caller
The Caller serves as group spokesperson, responsible for
informing the Referee about the actions and movements
of the party as a whole. Delegating this role to one player—
rather than having each player informing the Referee
about their PC’s individual actions—can speed up play,
especially with large groups.
Party leader: The caller’s character usually takes on
the role of party leader. Ideally, they should have high
Charisma and be located near to the front of the party.

Classes: It is wise for a party to consist of a mix of characters of different adventuring Classes. Combat-focused
characters are essential for protecting the group from
danger, while Classes blessed with magic or special skills
excel in other aspects vital to a life of adventure.

Switching caller: The designation of caller can change
during play. For example, the character addressing
monsters in an encounter may become the caller.

Level: As new PCs join play, the Levels of the characters
in the party may diverge. It is recommended that characters more than 4 Levels apart adventure separately, as
challenges and rewards suitable to characters of greatly
differing Levels do not match.

The Chronicler makes notes on the party’s adventures,
including monsters and NPCs encountered, battles
fought, clues discovered, and mysteries to be unravelled.
The chronicle is an invaluable tool for recalling previous
events, especially when some time has passed between
sessions. In longer campaigns, chroniclers record the
collective memory of the party’s epic adventures.

Splitting the Party
It is usually wise for characters to stick together when
adventuring, as there is strength in numbers. At times,
certain characters may wish to separate off from the
main party. For example, one or two stealthy characters
may wish to scout ahead of the main group.
When this happens, each group should be treated by
the Referee as a separate party, with separate Surprise
Rolls, wandering monster checks, etc.

Chronicler

Mapper
The party Mapper creates maps of the areas explored based
on the Referee’s descriptions. Details such as monsters or
traps encountered, clues to puzzles, or interesting unexplored areas may be noted on the map as it is drawn.
Lost maps: Maps may be treated as in-game items, created
by and in the possession of a specific character (who must
have a quill, ink, and paper). In this case, maps must be
treated with great care, in order to prevent loss or damage
in case harm should come to the character carrying them.

Quartermaster
The Quartermaster keeps track of the party’s accounts,
tracking shared provisions, light sources, and treasure.

Planning For Adventure

ADVENTURING ADVICE

Adventure Objective

Work As a Team

While it is perfectly possible for the party to set off on the
road out of town and simply wander at random, it is usually
preferable to have a specific adventuring objective in mind.
For example, players may decide to follow up on a rumour
heard in a settlement, investigate a mysterious feature
encountered on a previous adventure, try to defeat a previously encountered monster, or locate a certain region or
dungeon.

Above all, cooperate with other players to ensure the
survival of the group and success in adventuring. While
characters may not always see eye to eye and players may
disagree on the best course of action, only those who work
together find success. This is especially important when
characters are low Level, as individual characters are
unlikely to survive the dangers of the wilds alone.

Before starting an adventure, it is wise for players to think
through various aspects of their planned expedition. The
following are especially worthy of consideration.

Resources
Once an objective has been established, consider whether
any special resources are required.
Equipment: Additional equipment should be purchased
in advance, as needed. For example, characters may need
to stock up on rations for a journey into the wilds, or may
need additional torches or lantern oil for an expedition
into a dungeon.
Retainers: If the party is small or lacks characters of
certain Classes important to the adventure, consider seeking retainers (see p134).
Spells: Spell-casting characters should consider the needs
of the adventure when selecting which spells to memorise
or pray for.
Cooperation: To avoid carrying redundant equipment and
ensure a balanced selection of spells, make preparation
decisions together as a group.

Marching Order
Determine the normal arrangement of characters when
exploring, known as the party’s marching order. For
example, players may decide to move in a two-column
formation, with well-armoured characters in front, weaker
characters in the middle, and a rear guard. The group may
define different standard marching orders for common
situations (e.g. standard exploration, combat, opening
doors, searching, etc.).

Dividing Treasure
Before the adventure begins, agree on how to divide
treasure amongst surviving characters. The following is
a suggested approach.

Following are some basic words of advice on how players can maximise their enjoyment of the game and the
chances of their characters surviving and thriving.

Think Outside the Box
Kindreds and Classes grant a number of special capabilities
useful during adventures. However, more often than not,
hazards, challenges, and foes cannot be overcome simply
by using traits and powers listed on the character sheet.
Careful investigation of the environment, creative use of
equipment, clever plans, and harebrained schemes can be
equally effective. See also Narrative Interaction, p150.

Use Time Wisely
Every moment that passes during an adventure presents a
chance of the party being noticed by malignant monsters
(see Wandering Monsters, p155). Resources such as rations
and light sources dwindle. Party members tire and suffer
injuries. Wise players do not waste time when adventuring.

Avoid Unnecessary Combat
There is an element of risk any time a character’s fate is
determined by a roll of the dice. This is especially acute
during combat, where a die roll can make the difference
between life and death. Players are advised to avoid
direct confrontations where possible. If combat cannot
be avoided, players should use reconnaissance, planning,
and tactics to tip the chances in their favour.

Know When to Back Out
Keep a careful eye on the party’s strength and resources.
If these dwindle too far, a retreat to safety is advisable, to
recuperate and restock. Likewise, if combat turns against
the party, do not be afraid to flee. A tarnished pride is
preferable to an ignoble death in the maw of a ravening
monster.

Non-magical treasure: Player Characters evenly divide
coins and other monetary treasure. Retainers (see p134)
may be allocated a reduced share, as agreed during hiring.
Magic items: Items are allocated to the characters who can
best use them or who do not already have similar magic
items. Die rolls are used to break ties.

Core Rules
The fundamental rules used to resolve most situations of peril.

M

ost situations of peril and uncertainty are
resolved using one of a handful of core game
rules: a Skill Check, Ability Check, Saving Throw,
or Attack Roll. In situations where none of these core rules
obviously applies, the Referee may simply judge a chance
of success and ask the player to roll. See Chance Rolls.

Situational Modifiers
The Referee may apply modifiers to a Skill Check, Ability Check, Saving Throw, or Attack Roll, depending on
the difficulty of the situation.
Skill Check / Ability Check modifiers: Generally range
from –2 to +2, with a –2 penalty representing a very
challenging situation and a +2 bonus representing a
very easy situation.
Saving Throw / Attack Roll modifiers: Generally range
from –4 to +4, with a –4 penalty representing a very
challenging situation and a +4 bonus representing a
very easy situation.

Skill Checks

Skills represent specific competencies practiced by adventurers. All adventurers can use the Listen, Search, and
Survival skills, and some Classes grant the use of additional, specialised skills.
Rolling: Roll 1d6 and add any situational modifiers. If the
result equals or exceeds the character’s Skill Target for the
skill being tested, the check succeeds. Skills default to a
target of 6, unless the character’s Kindred or Class specifies
a lower target.
1s and 6s: A roll of natural 1 always fails and a roll of natural
6 always succeeds, irrespective of modifiers.
Kindred and Class: In cases where a Kindred and Class
grant an improved chance of success with a skill (i.e. a lower
Skill Target), use the more favourable.

When to Roll a Skill Check
Each skill applies in certain specific situations, when called
for in the rules.

d6 Rolls and d20 Rolls

Listen Checks: Rolled when a character presses their ear
to a door to detect the presence of creatures on the other
side (see Listening at Doors, p151).

The core rules use two different types of rolls, each with
different statistical properties.

Search Checks: Rolled when searching for secret doors or
traps (see Hidden Features, p152).

d6 rolls: A character’s training and aptitudes (as defined
by their Kindred, Class, or Ability Scores) strongly
determine the chance of success. In the case of Ability Checks, for example, the Ability Modifier (–3 to +3)
makes a huge difference on the scale of a d6 roll.

Survival Checks: Rolled when trying to find food in the
wild (see Finding Food in the Wild, p152).

d20 rolls: Randomness plays a stronger role in chance
of success. Ability Modifiers (–3 to +3) make only a small
difference on the scale of a d20 roll.

Specialised skills: Specialised Class skills are explained
in each Class description. These skills can only be used by
characters of the appropriate Class.

Ability Checks

Chance Rolls

An Ability Check represents a test of a character’s basic
physical or mental aptitudes (one of their Ability Scores),
rather than learned aptitudes due to their Class or Level.

In situations where no specific skill or Ability plays
a role or where sheer luck is the deciding factor, the
Referee may judge a chance of success and have the
player roll. Two common methods are judging an X-in-6
or a percentage chance.

1s and 6s: A roll of natural 1 always fails and a roll of natural
6 always succeeds, irrespective of modifiers.

X-in-6: The Referee judges the chance of success as a
likelihood out of 6. For example, a 3-in-6 chance for a
situation of even chances, or a 1-in-6 chance for a very
challenging situation.
Percentage chance: The Referee judges the chance of
success as a percentage. For example, a 50% chance for
a situation of even chances, or a 10% chance for a very
challenging situation.

144

Rolling: Roll 1d6 and add the Modifier of the Ability being
tested, along with any situational modifiers. If the result
equals or exceeds a target number of 4, the check succeeds

When to Roll an Ability Check
Ability Checks apply in certain specific situations, when
called for elsewhere in the rules (see the list under Ability
Scores, p22). The Referee may also optionally call for an
Ability Check in other situations as desired.

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Saving Throws

Certain dangerous or detrimental effects—for example, a
banshee’s deadly wail or a wyrm’s acidic breath—call for
a Saving Throw (sometimes called a save). This is a roll to
determine whether a character succumbs to or avoids the
effect. There are 5 Save Categories, each rolled for a different type of hazard: Doom, Ray, Hold, Blast, Spell.
Rolling: Roll 1d20 and add any applicable modifiers. If the
result equals or exceeds the character’s Save Target for
the applicable Save Category, the Saving Throw succeeds.

Attack Rolls

In the chaos of combat, the sequence of feints, dodges,
parries, and glancing blows that may occur each Round
are abstracted into an Attack Roll. This roll determines
whether an attacker lands a blow on their opponent.
Rolling: Roll 1d20 and add any applicable modifiers. If the
result equals or exceeds the defender’s Armour Class, the
attack hits. Make a Damage Roll.

Modifiers: For Saving Throws against effects of magical
origin, add the character’s Wisdom Modifier. Also add any
situational modifiers determined by the Referee.

Modifiers: Add the character’s Attack bonus (see the Class
progression table). For melee attacks, add the character’s
Strength Modifier. For missile attacks, add the character’s
Dexterity Modifier. Also add any situational modifiers
determined by the Referee.

1s and 20s: A roll of natural 1 always fails and a roll of natural 20 always succeeds, irrespective of modifiers.

1s and 20s: A roll of natural 1 always fails and a roll of natural 20 always succeeds, irrespective of modifiers.

When to Roll a Saving Throw

When to Roll an Attack Roll

The description of a spell, magic item, monster special
power, and so forth notes when to roll a Saving Throw
and which Save Category to roll against. For example, the
description of a spell may call for a Save Versus Spell.

An Attack Roll is made whenever one creature attempts to
physically harm another, whether using fists, claws, melee
weapons, or missile weapons. See Combat, p166.

Save Categories
Doom: Effects that instantly kill or inflict ongoing physical
malignities—for example, poison, disease, death magic.
Doom also serves as a general category for avoiding unfortunate fates that do not fall under any other Save Category.
Ray: Rapidly moving, directional effects that can be
dodged—for example, energy rays, lightning bolts.
Hold: Effects that hinder or prevent movement—for example, paralysis, petrification, falling rocks that may crush
or pin characters.
Blast: Lethal energy effects that fill a wide area—for example, wyrm breath, explosions.
Spell: Potent, directly targeted effects—for example,
arcane or holy spells, fairy glamours, magic staves.

Choosing a Save Category
In situations not covered by the rules (e.g. when creating
new spells or monsters), the Referee must choose an appropriate Save Category. A simple approach is to run down the
categories list above (from Doom to Spell) and choose the
first that fits the effect in question. For very unusual effects
that don’t fit in any category, default to Doom.

Damage Rolls
The equipment list (p118) notes the damage die rolled
for each type of weapon. Likewise, the descriptions of creatures with natural attack forms (e.g. claws, fangs) note the
damage die rolled.
Modifiers: Attacks with melee weapons apply the Strength
Modifier to the damage roll.
Hit Points: Rolled damage is subtracted from the target’s
Hit Points.
Minimum damage: A successful attack always inflicts at
least 1 damage, irrespective of modifiers.
Death: A target that reaches 0 Hit Points dies. Hit Points
are never reduced below 0.
Immunities: Some monsters are immune to attacks of
certain kinds. In this case, even if an attack hits, damage
is not rolled.
Recovering lost HP: Lost Hit Points can be recovered by
rest and healing. See Rest and Healing, p160.

Item Saving Throws
The equipment of a character killed by a destructive effect
(e.g. lightning) is assumed to be destroyed. Magic items
may be allowed a Save Versus Doom (using the character’s
Save Targets) to survive.

Time and Movement
The basic rules for character movement and tracking the passage of time.

W

hen exploring the untracked wilds or the
depths of the underworld, time is a critical
resource. Every moment wasted presents a
chance for malignant creatures to note the party’s presence. As time passes, light sources in dark places dwindle,
beneficial spells falter, and thirst, exhaustion, and hunger
set in. Wise adventurers do not linger, making the most of
every moment in perilous places.

Tracking Time

When an adventure is under way, the Referee should
keep track of the time that elapses in the imagined world,
known as game time. This is distinct from real time: what
may take the players and Referee mere seconds to describe
may take PCs hours or even days to complete.
Units of time: When characters are exploring a dungeon,
the Referee tracks the number of Turns that have elapsed;
when characters are exploring outdoors, the number of
days elapsed is tracked.
Judgement: The Referee adjudicates what characters may
accomplish in a given period of time.

Resources
As game time passes, the Referee should pay attention to
resources that the party consumes. For example: food,
water, fuel for light sources, durations of spells or magical
effects, etc.

146

Measures of Time: Rounds and Turns
Aside from everyday time increments (minutes, hours,
days, and so on), the following special units are used in
the game.
Turns: Approximately 10 minutes of game time. There
are 6 Turns in an hour. Time is measured in Turns when
exploring dungeons (see Dungeons, p162).
Rounds: Approximately 10 seconds of game time. There
are 60 Rounds in a Turn. Time is measured in Rounds
during encounters, especially in combat (see Encounters, p164 and Combat, p166).

Measures of Distance: Inches, Feet, Miles
Distances are measured in imperial or customary US
units: inches (notated with the ″ symbol), feet (notated
with the ′ symbol), and miles.
Conversions: 1 foot = 12 inches. 1 mile = 5,280 feet.

Measures of Weight: Coins
Weight measures typically come into play only when
discussing how much characters can carry (see Encumbrance, p148). As coins are the most common form
of treasure found by adventurers, all weights are measured in coins (ten coins equal one pound).

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Tracking Movement

Running: Speed × 3 Per Round

As Player Characters explore the imagined world, the
Referee should keep track of their location on a prepared
map. The map is usually kept secret from the players, who
must rely on the Referee’s descriptions of the areas they
explore.

When fleeing or pursuing enemies (see Evasion, p165),
characters can move up to 3 times their Speed in feet each
Round. For example, a party whose slowest member has
Speed 30 can run up to 90′ each Round.

To determine how long it takes for characters to move
from one area to the next, the Referee should refer to the
characters’ Speed (see p17).

Exhaustion: Characters become exhausted (see Exhaustion, p151) after running at this rate for 30 Rounds. The
penalties for exhaustion last until characters have rested
for 3 Turns.

Party Speed
An adventuring party usually wants to stay together. The
Speed of the party as a whole is determined by the Speed
of the slowest member.

Encounter Movement: Speed / Round
During an encounter, a character’s Speed indicates the
number of feet they can move each Round. This is especially relevant during combat. For example, a character
with Speed 40 can move up to 40′ each Round.

Exploration: Speed × 3 Per Turn
When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon or other
indoor area, characters can move up to 3 times their Speed
in feet each Turn. For example, a party whose slowest
member has Speed 30 can explore up to 90′ each Turn. This
very slow rate of movement accounts for PCs exploring
in a dark, unknown environment, moving carefully and
stealthily, and mapping progress.
In familiar areas: When PCs are moving through previously explored areas which they have mapped, they may
move at up to 10 times their Speed in feet each Turn. For
example, a party whose slowest member has Speed 30 can
travel through up to 300′ of familiar areas each Turn.

Mapping: No mapping is possible when running.

Overland Travel: Speed / 5 Travel Points
Per Day
The Referee’s map of Dolmenwood (provided in the
Dolmenwood Campaign Book) is based on a hex grid, with
each hex being 6 miles across. When travelling along
roads or in the wilds, characters gain Travel Points each
day equal to their Speed divided by 5. For example, a party
whose slowest members has Speed 30 gains 6 Travel Points
per day. Travel Points are expended as characters explore
hexes of different terrain types. See Travel, p156 for full
details on Travel Points and overland travel.

Using Miniatures
Some groups like to use miniatures along with a gridded
tabletop surface to track exploration and combat.
Play surface: The most convenient type of surface is something on which maps can be drawn with erasable pens. The
surface should be gridded for ease of tracking the movements of characters.
Scale: The typical scale used is 1″ on the play surface = 5′ in
the game world.
Miniatures: Miniature figures are available to purchase
from many different companies. Alternatively, simple
tokens like dice or beads can be used.

Encumbrance
Rules governing how much gear and treasure adventurers can haul around.

I

n the perilous wilds, an adventurer’s equipment
makes the difference between life and death. A
rope can prevent falling into a deathly chasm,
a burning torch can fend off wild beasts, and a humble
fishing rod can provide a meal to fill hungry bellies. Characters must carefully consider the equipment they take
with them when adventuring, as each person is only able
to carry so much. Each item carried is at once a burden and
a potential lifesaver in times of peril.
Two approaches to determine how much characters can
carry are presented here: one based on tracking the total
weight of items carried, the other based on tracking the
number of items carried. The Referee should decide which
to use, and it should be applied to all characters.

Weight Encumbrance

This encumbrance system is based on tracking the individual weights of items carried, giving a detailed and fairly
realistic overview of each character’s load.

Basic Weight Encumbrance (Optional Rule)
This option may be used by groups who prefer a simpler
encumbrance system based on weight carried.
Equipment: The weight of armour, weapons, and
adventuring gear is not tracked and does not count
towards a character’s maximum load.
Treasure: The weight of treasure carried is tracked to
make sure that the character’s maximum load is not
exceeded. See Weight of Common Treasures.
Maximum load: The maximum load of treasure any
character can carry is 1,600 coins of weight. Characters
carrying more than this cannot move.

Determining Speed
A character’s Speed is determined by the type of
armour they are wearing and whether they are carrying a significant amount of treasure (as judged by the
Referee). See the Basic Encumbrance table.

Carrying Capacity
The total weight of the character’s gear is tracked. As coins
are the most common form of treasure found by adventurers, all weights are measured in coins. Ten coins equal
one pound.
Equipment: The equipment lists note the weight of all
weapons, armour, and items of adventuring gear. Groups
wishing to simplify tracking may treat a character’s miscellaneous gear (e.g. backpacks, ropes, torches, etc.)—excluding weapons and armour—as a total of 100 coins of weight.

Slot Encumbrance

Items in Gear Slots

This encumbrance system is based on gear slots, giving
a simple and abstract overview of each character’s load.
Each item carried occupies 0–3 gear slots—see Items in
Gear Slots. Characters become slower and more burdened
depending on the number of gear slots occupied.

Equipped Items: 10 Slots
Characters have 10 slots for equipped items, that is anything
the character is wearing, holding, actively using, or has
ready to use at short notice: armour worn, shields or weapons held, sheathed weapons, items in a belt pouch.
Maximum load: A character cannot carry more than 10
slots of equipped items.

Stowed Items: 10 Slots / Container
Sacks and backpacks each have 10 slots for stowed items,
that is items packed away in the container.
Maximum load: A character cannot carry more than a
total of 16 slots of stowed items.
Maximum containers: A character can wear one backpack and can carry up to two sacks, each occupying one
hand. When carrying a sack, the character cannot carry a
weapon, shield, lantern, or other object in that hand.
Retrieving: In combat, retrieving a stowed item takes 1
Round.

Determining Speed
A character’s Speed is determined by the number of occupied gear slots, shown in the Slot Encumbrance table. Track
the number of equipped and stowed items separately, look
up both in the table, and use the slowest Speed listed.

SLOT ENCUMBRANCE
Occupied Slots
Equipped
Stowed
0–3

The Item Gear Slots table lists the number of gear slots
occupied by different kinds of items.
General items: Unless noted otherwise, each object a
character carries occupies 1 gear slot.
Tiny items: Some very small items only occupy a
gear slot if carried in large numbers (as judged by the
Referee).
Bundled items: Some items are purchased and carried
in bundles. A bundle occupies 1 gear slot.
Containers: Containers (e.g. backpacks, sacks) only
count as an item when not in use.
Bulky items: Large or heavy objects that require
two hands to carry occupy 2 gear slots and cannot be
stowed. Very heavy or bulky objects may occupy 3 or
more gear slots, as judged by the Referee.
Clothing and armour: Clothing does not occupy a gear
slot. Light armour occupies 1 slot, Medium armour 2,
and Heavy armour 3. A shield occupies 1 slot.

Example: A fighter wearing plate mail (3 equipped slots) and

containing a tinder box, 3 flasks of oil, a lantern, a rope, and
a waterskin (7 stowed items). The 7 stowed items do not alter
their Speed. If, later in an adventure, they fill a sack with 600gp
(6 stowed items, for a total of 13 stowed items), their Speed
would be reduced to 20.

Horses and Vehicles
The number of items that mounts and vehicles can carry
is calculated by dividing their coin capacity by 100 (see
Horses and Vehicles, p120). The distinction between
equipped and stowed items does not apply to horses and
vehicles.

Dropping Items
When characters discover large treasure hoards, they
may have to drop items, abandoning adventuring gear
in order to stuff their sacks with gold.
In desperate circumstances, such as when fleeing
enemies, characters may choose to drop items to
lighten their load. Weapons, shields, and even stuffed
sacks or backpacks may be dropped to increase a character’s Speed.

Hazards and Challenges
Rules for handling common adventuring situations.

C

Climbing

Narrative Interaction

Cold

haracters adventuring in the wilds or the underworld must traverse all manner of environmental features: trees to climb, chasms to bridge,
floors and walls to probe, mysterious statues and altars to
examine, and so forth. This section presents guidelines
for handling the most common types of environmental
features, hazards, and challenges.

The basic game procedure (p138) serves as the fundamental means of interacting with hazards and challenges.
The environment is described and clarified with questions
from the group, then the characters act and the Referee
judges what happens. Sometimes a die roll is required—
putting a character’s fate in the hands of chance—but it is
often possible to bypass hazards using ingenuity, without
any kind of random roll.
Example: Exploring a cave system of crystal-encrusted grottoes, the party comes across a 10′ wide chasm blocking their
path. The players ask the Referee if they can jump across.
Consulting the rules for jumping (p153), the Referee says
that a Strength Check is required. Not liking the odds, the
players discuss other approaches. Could the large statue they
previously encountered be dragged here and tipped across the
chasm as a bridge? Could they attach a rope and grappling hook
to rocks on the other side and swing across?

Adventurer Competency
When dealing with hazards and challenges, it is useful
to recall that all PCs, no matter their Class, are professional adventurers. Even the most bookish magician has
chosen to leave the safety of their master’s tower and
take up a life of adventure. Such a lifestyle brings with
it the following basic competencies. Adventurers can
perform these tasks under normal conditions without
a roll or check.
Camping: Finding campsites, setting up tents, gathering firewood, lighting fires.
Horse riding: Basic riding and care of horses.
Mapping: Pacing out and estimating distances, basic
mapping symbols.
Rope use: Throwing, grappling, climbing, common
knots.
Swimming: Treading water, swimming short distances.
Travelling: Packing gear, route planning, basic navigation.
Valuing treasure: Identifying gems, valuing trade
goods and art objects.

150

Characters can make trivial climbs in non-pressured situations without a roll (e.g. climbing into the lower branches
of a tree). In more difficult or tense situations, the Referee
may require a Dexterity Check. If the check fails, the character falls at the halfway point, suffering 1d6 damage per
10′ of the fall.

Characters travelling in extremely cold weather without
adequate protection (e.g. a winter cloak—see Adventuring
Gear, p116) lose 1d4 Hit Points per day.

Darkness and Blindness

Wise characters carry illumination—magical or
mundane—when exploring at night or underground. Typical light sources enable normal vision within a 30′ radius.
Low light: In low light conditions (e.g. at night without a
light source), characters suffer a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls
and move at half Speed.
Pitch darkness or blindness: Characters plunged into
darkness or suddenly blinded suffer a –4 penalty to Attack
Rolls, Armour Class, and Saving Throws and have Speed 10.

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Doors

Listening at Doors

Doors are a common obstacle in dungeons and indoor
spaces, restricting vision and access. Furthermore, doors
may be locked, stuck, or hidden from plain sight.

Most doors do not block obvious, loud noises, but characters may attempt to detect the presence of monsters
waiting quietly beyond a closed door by pressing an ear
against it to listen. The Referee then rolls a Listen Check.

Secret Doors

Time: Each listening attempt takes 1 Turn.

Whether cunningly integrated into stonework or concealed
beneath a blanket of moss, some doors cannot be seen by
casual observation. Searching for secret doors is discussed
under Hidden Features, p152.

Multiple characters: If space permits, multiple characters
may listen at the same door. Up to 2 characters can simultaneously listen at a typical door.

Locked Doors

Referee rolls: The Referee rolls all Listen Checks, so that
players do not know if the roll failed or if there is simply
no sound to be heard.

If the correct key cannot be located, a locked door may
be broken open, opened by magic (e.g. the Knock spell,
p82), or picked by a thief (see p74).
Breaking open: A successful Strength Check, the use of
a tool (e.g. an axe or a crowbar), and 1 Turn of effort are
usually enough to smash or pry open a typical wooden
door. At the Referee’s discretion, the noise produced may
trigger an additional check for Wandering Monsters, p155.

Stuck Doors
A stuck door is unlocked but so obstructed that it cannot
be opened without force (for example, due to being swollen
or blocked by roots).
Forcing: Characters can attempt to shoulder barge a
stuck door with a Strength Check. If successful, the door
is rapidly forced open. A failed attempt eliminates any
possibility of surprising (see Encounters, p164) any creatures on the other side of the door.

Retrying: Characters may listen at the same door as often
as they wish, each attempt requiring an additional Turn.

Silent monsters: Some monsters (e.g. undead) cannot be
detected by listening.

Exhaustion

When adventuring, characters must rest at intervals to
avoid exhaustion. See Travel, p156 and Dungeons, p162.
Effects of exhaustion: Character who fail to rest suffer a –1
penalty to Attack and Damage Rolls until they rest.
Cumulative: Multiple sources of exhaustion are cumulative (to a maximum penalty of –4). For example, a party
that slept poorly and has not rested while exploring a
dungeon suffers a –2 penalty.

Falling

Falling from a height onto a hard surface inflicts 1d6
damage per 10′ fallen.

151

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Finding Food in the Wild

Dolmenwood is rich in tasty plants, fish, and game animals.
When on a long journey, a party may try to find food in the
wilds, rather than relying on rations purchased in a settlement. The party may choose to fish, forage, or hunt—all
handled by rolling a Survival Check for the day.
Time: If characters devote a whole day exclusively to finding food, without travelling, they gain a +2 bonus to the
Survival Check. Otherwise, it is assumed they are looking
for food during rest periods throughout the day.
Multiple characters: A single Survival Check is made for
each group of characters travelling together, using the best
Skill Target of all characters.
Splitting up: Characters may split into smaller groups
to improve their chances of finding food, making one
Survival Check per group, but this is dangerous: each
group has a separate chance of losing direction (p153)
and encountering wandering monsters (p155).

Fishing
Using a fishing rod and tackle (see Adventuring Gear,
p116), fishing is possible in any hex on the Dolmenwood
map which contains a lake or river. The DCB lists the kinds
of fish that can be caught.
Yield: Successful fishing provides 2d6 fresh rations.

Foraging
The DCB lists the kinds of plants and mushrooms that can
be found.
Yield: Successful foraging provides 1d6 fresh rations (1d4
in winter, 1d8 in autumn). Rare and magical herbs—only
found in certain areas of Dolmenwood—may also turn up
in the harvest.

Hunting
Successful hunting means that characters have crept up
on game animals. The DCB lists the kinds of game animals
that can be hunted.
Combat: The party must then attempt to kill the game
animals. This is handled as a normal combat encounter.
The party has surprise (see Surprise, p164) and begins
the encounter 1d4 × 30′ away from the quarry.
Yield: The party gains fresh rations based on the Hit Points
of game animals killed: 1 ration per HP for Small animals, 2
rations per HP for Medium, and 4 rations per HP for Large
(or more for extremely large creatures, per the Referee’s
judgement).

Hidden Features

When exploring tangled woods, forsaken moors, or
benighted ruins, not all is always as it seems. Fairy doors
linger in secluded glades, forgotten towers lurk in lost dells,
and hidden doors lie concealed behind fronds of moss.
Adventurers with the persistence to look more deeply may
discover all manner of secrets.

Hidden Features Outdoors
Some areas of the Dolmenwood campaign map contain
hidden features which go unnoticed by a party simply
wandering past. Hidden features can be found by searching—see Searching Hexes, p157.

Hidden Features in Dungeons
In enclosed spaces, hidden features can often be located by
narrative interaction (p150). Alternatively, players may
declare that they are searching a certain object or 10′ × 10′
area for hidden features (e.g. traps, secret doors, hidden
compartments, etc.). The Referee rolls a Search Check.
Time: Each search takes 1 Turn.
Multiple characters: If space permits, multiple characters
may search the same object or area. Up to 3 characters can
simultaneously search a 10′ × 10′ area.
Retrying: Characters may search the same object or area
again as often as they wish, each attempt requiring an
additional Turn.
Referee rolls: The Referee rolls all Search Checks, so that
players do not know if the roll failed or if there are simply
no hidden features present.

Hunger and Thirst

Hunger: Adventurers must be careful to pack provisions
sufficient for their journey, or be prepared to Find Food in
the Wild. Characters who go without food for a whole day
or longer begin to suffer deleterious effects as indicated in
the Effects of Hunger table.
Thirst: Water is easy to find throughout Dolmenwood, in
pools and little streams. Characters without access to water
suffer the effects of going without food (see the Effects of
Hunger table) and lose 3 Constitution per day. Death results
if Constitution is reduced to 0.

Jumping

Long jumps: Characters can jump across a stream, chasm,
or pit of up to 5′ wide with a 20′ run-up—no roll is required.
For longer jumps of up to 10′, a Strength Check is required.
High jumps: Characters can jump over obstacles of up to
3′ high with a 20′ run-up—no roll is required. For higher
jumps of up to 5′, a Strength Check is required.

Losing Direction
Getting Lost Outdoors
Overland travel is described at an abstract level, without
detailing the minutiae of winding paths and minor terrain
obstacles the party navigates. When travelling with a reliable guide, following a road or river, or heading towards an
obvious landmark, there is no risk of getting lost. Otherwise, the Referee rolls for a chance that the party gets lost
each travel day.
Chance: The chance of the party becoming lost depends
on the type of terrain being explored—see Travel, p156.
Inclement weather conditions (e.g. fog, blizzard) may also
increase the chance of getting lost.
When to roll: Typically, the roll for getting lost is made at
the start of the travel day. If the party starts the day travelling along a road (no chance of getting lost), the roll for
getting lost is made when they leave the road.
Getting lost: The effects of becoming lost are described in
the Dolmenwood Campaign Book.

Getting Lost in Dungeons
Dungeon exploration focuses on the precise details of
rooms and passages the party traverses. There is no roll
to check for getting lost, but players should carefully map
dungeon areas explored. The players’ map and memories
are their sole means to maintain orientation and recall
safe routes out of the dungeon.
Getting lost: Characters who are captured, magically
transported, or who lose their map may no longer know
where they are in relation to previously explored areas.
Characters in this situation should start a new map and
attempt to find their way back to a known area. The old
and new maps can then be connected.

Modifiers: –1 if wearing Medium armour, –2 if wearing
Heavy armour.

153

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Stealth

When two groups approach each other, there is a chance
that one or both is unaware of the other’s presence. This is
handled by a Surprise Roll (see Surprise, p164).
Movement and encumbrance: Exploration movement
(see Time and Movement, p146) is careful and stealthy,
so as not to automatically give away a group’s presence.
Heavily laden characters must move especially slowly, to
avoid armour or other gear making noise. This is handled
by the encumbrance rules (p148) reducing laden characters’ Speed.

Sneaking
When attempting to sneak up on or sneak past a creature,
a Surprise Roll is made each Round. If the roll indicates
surprise, the sneaking party may move for 1 Round without
being detected. Otherwise, the sneaking party is spotted.
Vigilance: If creatures are actively watching (e.g. a guard
staring fixedly down a corridor, without moving), the
Referee may rule that sneaking is impossible. Most creatures cannot maintain this level of vigilance for long.
Distractions: If creatures are engaged in some activity (e.g.
feeding, conversation) or distracted by a noise elsewhere,
the Referee may rule that their chance of being surprised
is increased.
Lone characters: Sometimes a single character (e.g. a thief
or hunter) splits off from the main party to scout ahead. In
this case, treat the character as a separate party with their
own Surprise Rolls.

Hiding and Ambushes
A common tactic is to hide behind some kind of cover in
order to evade detection or to surprise foes. The chance of
being spotted by casual passersby is determined by the
density of cover available, as judged by the Referee.
Complete cover: A creature fully concealed from view
(e.g. behind a wall, inside a coffer, etc.) automatically goes
undetected.
Partial cover: The Referee should judge the chance of the
creature being spotted based on the density of cover, for
example as an X-in-6 roll.
Searching: The above assumes enemies casually wandering past the location where a creature is hidden. If an
enemy is actively searching, it is only a matter of time
before the hiding place is uncovered.
Ambushing: When creatures attack from hiding, the
opposing side’s chance of being surprised is increased by 1.
For example, the standard 2-in-6 chance of being surprised
increases to 3-in-6.
Example: Hearing the echoing footsteps of castle guards
approaching, a gang of burglars quickly dives behind cover.
One character jumps inside a closet and shuts the door,
another hides behind a curtain, and the third crouches behind
a statue in a corner. The Referee rules that the character in the
closet automatically goes undetected, the character behind
the curtain has a 1-in-6 chance of being spotted (their feet
are sticking out at the bottom), and the character behind the
statue has a 3-in-6 chance.

154

Suffocation

A character can survive for up to 1 Round (10 seconds)
per point of Constitution before suffocating to death. For
example, a character with Constitution 12 can survive
without breath for at most 2 minutes.

Swimming

Unless there is an obvious reason why a character could
not have learned to swim, it is assumed that all characters
can swim.
Speed: Characters can swim at half their normal Speed.

Swimming in Armour
Attempting to swim while wearing armour is perilous in
the extreme. Characters must make a Strength Check to
avoid going under, modified as follows.
Light armour: No modifier.
Medium armour: –2 penalty.
Heavy armour: –4 penalty.
Rough waters: –1 or –2 penalty, as judged by the Referee.

Drowning
A character forced underwater can hold their breath for a
short time before drowning. See Suffocation.

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Traps

Intelligent creatures often protect their lairs and treasures
with traps to deter intruders. Concealed pits may drop the
unwary into captivity or onto deadly spikes. Envenomed
needles may be concealed in locks, ready to spring out and
poison would-be thieves. Adventurers should be wary of
such hazards and act with care.

Triggering Traps
Each trap has a trigger—an action which causes it to spring
(e.g. turning a door handle, walking into a specific area).
Chance of triggering: Many traps have unreliable mechanisms, due to shoddy construction, lack of maintenance,
or poor environmental conditions. When a character
performs the action that triggers a trap, there is a 2-in-6
chance of the trap being sprung. Better maintained traps
may have a higher chance of springing, if the Referee
wishes.
Failing to trigger: When a trap fails to spring, the Referee
may optionally give players a clue as to its presence. For
example, the character may hear a click or feel the movement of a pressure plate, as the trap is almost but not quite
fully triggered.
Monsters and traps: Monsters often know how to safely
bypass traps in the area where they live.

Searching for Traps
Searching for traps is discussed under Hidden Features,
p152.

Disarming and Bypassing Traps
Many traps can be disarmed or bypassed by narrative
interaction (p150). See Tips for Handling Traps. Thieves
additionally have the ability to disarm fiddly, mechanical
traps (e.g. trapped locks)—see p74.

Tips for Handling Traps
The following tricks are often useful when dealing with
traps.
Force: Smashing the lock of a chest with a hammer may
destroy a delicate poison dart trap without triggering it.
Jamming: A judiciously placed rock or flagstone may
be able to jam the mechanism of a trap, preventing it
from triggering.
Liquids: Water poured over a floor may trickle down
cracks, revealing a secret trapdoor or hidden pit.
Probing: Tapping ahead with a pole may trigger a tripwire.
Tapping: Tapping along walls listening for a hollow
sound may reveal hidden compartments.
Weight: A heavy object thrown onto a section of floor
may trigger a pressure plate.

Wandering Monsters

Besides the monsters noted as inhabiting specific areas of a
dungeon or outdoor region, PCs may randomly encounter
monsters on the move between areas. These are known
as wandering monsters. See Travel, p156 and Dungeons,
p162 for specific details.
Frequency: The Referee rolls periodically to determine
whether a wandering monster is encountered. The
frequency of checks depends on the type of area being
explored.
Chance: When a wandering monster check is made, the
chance of a random encounter depends on the type of
area being explored (e.g. dungeon region or level, type of
outdoor terrain).
Monster type: Each area has its own table of wandering
monsters, found in the DCB or the adventure scenario
being run. The Referee rolls on the appropriate table when
an encounter takes place.
Attracting attention: If the party is making a lot of noise
or carrying bright light sources in a dark environment, the
Referee may increase the chance of wandering monsters
being encountered.
Hiding: If the party rests quietly in an out-of-the-way location, the Referee may decrease the chance of wandering
monsters being encountered.

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Travel
The basic procedures for travelling and exploring in the wilds of Dolmenwood.

Travel Procedure Per Day
1. Weather: The Referee determines the day’s weather,
using the tables in the Dolmenwood Campaign Book.
2. Decide course: The players decide on their course of
travel for the day.
3. Losing direction: The Referee determines whether
the party gets lost, depending on the terrain.
4. Wandering monsters: The Referee makes a check for
a daytime random encounter.
5. Description: The Referee describes the terrain
passed through and any sites of interest that the
party comes across, asking players for their actions
as required. If monsters are encountered, follow the
procedure described in Encounters, p164.
6. End of day: If still in the wilds, the party sets camp
(see Camping, p158). The Referee updates time
records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the party’s need to rest.

Time

When travelling overland through Dolmenwood, game
time is tracked in days.

Roads, Tracks, and
Travelling Wild

Adventurers may at times follow useful pathways connecting settlements, but they often find themselves travelling
in the wild woods.
Roads: Actively maintained roads. Parties following a road
travel quickly and have no risk of getting lost.
Tracks: Smaller paths which are seldom frequented and
sporadically maintained. Parties following a track travel
quickly but have a small risk of getting lost.
Travelling wild: All travel off tracks and roads is classified
as travelling wild. The speed of travel and chance of getting
lost are determined by the type of terrain.

Map Hexes

The Referee’s map of Dolmenwood (provided in the
Dolmenwood Campaign Book) is based on a hex grid, with
each hex being 6 miles across. When characters travel
through the Wood, the Referee tracks their progress on
the hex map.
Players may also wish to keep a map of their own, making
notes on hexes as they explore. A blank hex map of
Dolmenwood that players can fill in as they explore can
be downloaded from dolmenwood.com.

156

Movement

Rather than tracking the exact time spent travelling or
the precise distances traversed, travel in Dolmenwood
is abstracted into a simple system of daily Travel Points,
representing the time taken for various travel actions.

Travel Points
A party has Travel Points each day equal to its Speed
divided by 5, as shown in the Travel Points Per Day table.
Any excess Travel Points not used by the end of the day
are lost.

TRAVEL POINTS PER DAY

12

3

Mounted: A mounted party has Speed 40.
Vehicles: A party travelling with a cart or wagon has Speed 30.

Normal Travel
A normal day of travel (whether on roads, tracks, or in the
wild) is assumed to last 12 hours, with 8 hours spent travelling and 4 hours spent resting, preparing meals, eating,
setting up and taking down camp, and so forth.

Forced March
A party may push itself to travel extra distance in a day,
gaining a 50% increase in Travel Points (see the Travel
Points Per Day table). This requires a 16 hour travel day,
including 12 solid hours of travel.
Exhaustion: Following a forced march, characters must
rest for a full day or become exhausted (see Exhaustion,
p151). Characters who forced march again without resting suffer cumulative exhaustion penalties (–1 per day).

Travelling on Roads and Tracks
The Referee tracks the party’s position along roads or
tracks as they travel.
Travel Point cost: 6 miles costs 2 Travel Points, unaffected
by the type of terrain or the number of hexes passed
through. On the Referee’s hex map (DCB), roads and tracks
are annotated with 6 mile marker points.
Hex features: The party may explore any features along
the roadside in hexes they pass through. Features further
from the road are missed.

Travelling Wild
The Referee tracks the party’s position on the hex map,
noting the current hex they are in.
Travel Point cost: The Terrain Types table lists the cost to
enter an adjacent hex, based on its terrain type.
Hex features: Once the party has paid the Travel Point cost
to enter a hex, they may explore any non-hidden features
in that hex without further expenditure of Travel Points.
End of day: If the party does not have sufficient Travel
Points to enter an adjacent hex, the Referee should note
how many Travel Points they have expended and how
many must be expended the next day to enter the hex.
Example: A party with 2 Travel Points remaining is travelling
from a farmland hex toward an adjacent hex consisting of bog
(3 Travel Points to enter). The party spends the 2 Travel Points
it has, nearing the edge of the bog hex but unable to enter it
today due to being 1 Travel Point short. The party makes camp
in the farmland hex. The following day the party need only
spend 1 further Travel Point to enter the bog hex.

Mounts and Vehicles

Wet, muddy woods
Broken terrain, cliffs
Wetland, sparse trees
Dense thorn thickets

Searching Hexes

Some hexes on the Dolmenwood campaign map contain
hidden features which stay unnoticed by a party simply
wandering through the area. Hidden features can be found
by searching a hex, requiring extra time and Travel Points.
Travel Point cost: The Terrain Types table lists the cost to
search a hex, based on its terrain type.
Hidden features: Searching may reveal hidden features in
a hex, if any are present. Once a hidden feature has been
located, it can be found again without searching.

Losing Direction

See Losing Direction, p153 for more information.
Checks: One roll for getting lost is made each day. The
Referee makes this roll at the start of the travel day. If the
party is travelling along a road (no chance of getting lost),
the roll for getting lost is made when they leave the road.
Travelling wild: The chance of getting lost depends on
the terrain being explored—see the Terrain Types table.
Following a road: There is no chance of getting lost.
Following a track: There is a 1-in-6 chance of getting lost.

Mounts and land vehicles provide convenient means of
travelling with heavy loads, but they become inconvenient
when characters are travelling wild.

Visibility: In conditions of reduced visibility, such as fog
or blizzards, the chance of getting lost increases by 1 (e.g.
2-in-6 becomes 3-in-6), and in darkness by 2.

Speed and Travel Points

Effects of getting lost: The effects of getting lost are
described in the Dolmenwood Campaign Book.

Mounts: A mounted party has Speed 40 (8 Travel Points per
day). While some mounts have Speed faster than 40, they
can only move at this rate for short bursts.
Land vehicles: A party travelling with a cart or wagon has
Speed 30 (6 Travel Points per day).

Terrain Restrictions
Mounts and land vehicles can travel freely along roads
and tracks, but travelling wild is limited by certain terrain
types. The Terrain Types table lists which types of terrain
mounts and vehicles may enter, with mounts only able to
be led (i.e. not ridden) in certain types of terrain.

Resting

Characters must rest for 1 day per week of travel (i.e. 6 days
of travel, 1 day of rest) or become exhausted (see Exhaustion, p151).

Wandering Monsters

See Wandering Monsters, p155 for more information.
Checks: One check for wandering monsters is made each
day. The Referee may make this roll either at the start of
the day, halfway through the day (when the party has spent
half its Travel Points), or at the end of the day.
Chance: The chance of an encounter depends on the type
of terrain being traversed—see the Terrain Types table.
Creature: The Dolmenwood Campaign Book includes tables
to determine the type of creatures encountered.
Distance: Wandering monsters are encountered 2d6 × 30′
away. If both sides are surprised (see Encounters, p164),
this is reduced to 1d4 × 30′.

Camping
Procedures for setting up a campsite and sleeping in the wilds.

Camping Procedure
1. Setup activities: The players decide which characters prepare the campsite, fetch firewood, and fetch
water. Any applicable rolls are made.
2. Camp activities: Characters may build a fire. Optionally, someone may try to cook a meal and someone
may try to entertain the group. Any applicable rolls
are made.
3. Watches through the night: Players may decide to
set a series of watches through the night.
4. Wandering monsters: The Referee makes a check for
a nighttime random encounter.
5. Sleep: Characters bed down for the night. Depending
on conditions, a Constitution Check may be required
to get a good night’s rest.
6. Waking up: Characters who slept well heal 1 HP.
Spell-casters may prepare new spells for the day.

Quick Camping (Optional Rule)
Groups desiring a quicker method of resolving campsite activities may rule that if the party has camping
gear suitable for the weather conditions, they automatically succeed in getting a good night’s rest. The full
procedure may be used in adverse conditions.

Setup Activities
Preparing the Campsite
At least one character must remain at the campsite to clear
away branches and rocks, set up tents and bedrolls, prepare
a fire pit, and so forth.

Fetching Firewood
Finding wood suitable for building a campfire (i.e. not
damp, rotting, frozen, etc.) can be difficult and depends
primarily on the weather.
Amount of wood: Each character who goes fetching wood
can collect enough to keep a campfire burning for 1d6
hours.
Bad conditions: The Referee may apply situational modifiers to the roll for the amount of wood found, for example:
–1 for damp conditions, –2 in snow, –4 in heavy rain.

Fetching Water
Dolmenwood is riddled with little streams, pools, and
springs, making it easy to find water suitable for drinking.
Characters may refill any waterskins or other containers.

158

Camp Activities
Building a Fire
Given a means of producing flame (e.g. a tinder box, magic)
and a stash of wood (either gathered from the forest or
carried in packs), a character may build a fire. In normal
conditions, fire building automatically succeeds.
Bad conditions: In troublesome circumstances, the
Referee may rule that there is only a 4-in-6 (or worse)
chance of successfully getting a fire going.

Cooking
Given a fire, cooking pots, and ingredients (e.g. foraged
food, fresh rations, hunted game), someone may cook a
meal. The cook should make a Wisdom Check.
If the check succeeds: An especially tasty dish is produced.
Those who eat the meal gain a +1 bonus to any Constitution Checks required to rest (see Sleep), due to their hearty
supper.
If the check fails: A palatable but not exemplary dish is
produced. On a natural 1, the cook must Save Versus Doom
or produce a ruined and utterly inedible meal (burned,
spilled, etc.), wasting the ingredients used.

Camaraderie
Time spent around the fireside with one’s companions may
lift the spirits and induce restful sleep. A character may
attempt to entertain with music, song, stirring tales, jokes,
and so forth. The entertainer should make a Charisma
Check.
If the check succeeds: All characters gain a +1 bonus to any
Constitution Checks required to rest (see Sleep).
If the check fails: The attempt to entertain falls flat. On
a natural 1, the entertainer must Save Versus Doom or
incur ridicule and discord, incurring a –1 penalty to any
Constitution Checks required to rest (see Sleep).

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Watches through
the night

Sleeping Characters and Surprise

Characters often establish a series of watches through the
night, with at least one character remaining awake at all
times. The following rules may be used to handle this.
Watch durations: The party’s rest period typically lasts
around 8 hours, with 4 characters taking 2 hour watches
during that time. Characters who sleep for less than 6
hours fail to get a good night’s rest (see Sleep).
Spell-casters: Characters whose sleep is interrupted by
taking a watch have difficulty memorising or praying for
spells the following morning. See Difficulty Preparing
Spells under Sleep.

Falling Asleep on Watch (Optional Rule)
Groups wishing to add an element of slapstick and danger
may declare a basic 1-in-10 chance of each character falling
asleep during their watch. Characters with Constitution
15 or higher have only a 1-in-20 chance of falling asleep,
while characters with Constitution 6 or lower have a 1-in-6
chance.

If an encounter occurs, all characters who are asleep
are automatically surprised (see Encounters, p164).
This may mean that some characters in the party are
surprised while others are not.

Wandering Monsters

See Wandering Monsters, p155 for more information.
Checks: One check for wandering monsters is made per
night. If a nighttime encounter is rolled, the Referee may
randomly determine when during the night it occurs (e.g.
during which character’s watch).
Chance: The chance of an encounter occurring depends on
the type of terrain the party is camping in—see the Terrain
Types table (p157).
Creature: The Dolmenwood Campaign Book includes tables
to determine the type of creatures encountered.
Distance: Wandering monsters are encountered 2d6 × 30′
away. If both sides are surprised (see Encounters, p164),
this is reduced to 1d4 × 30′.

If a character falls asleep on watch, this may throw off the
whole sequence of watches, as the character does not wake
the next person in line, and so on.

Sleep

Getting a Good Night’s Rest

In ideal conditions of warmth and comfort, characters rest
peacefully and awake refreshed. Ideal conditions are not
easy to come by when bedding down among the roots and
bracken of the forest, however.

The character awakes refreshed by the primordial woodland airs, with the following effects:

Sleep Difficulty

The character rises grumpy, tired, and uncomfortable, with
the following effects:

When camping in the wild, characters’ ability to get a good
night’s rest is determined by their equipment (whether
they have a bedroll and/or tent), their warmth (whether
they have a campfire burning), and the season. See the
Sleep Difficulty table.
Easy: The character gets a good night’s rest.
Moderate: The character must make a Constitution Check
to get a good night’s rest.
Difficult: The character must make a Constitution Check
with a –2 penalty to get a good night’s rest.

Recuperation: The character heals 1 Hit Point.

Failure to Get a Good Night’s Rest
Exhaustion: The character is exhausted until they get a
good night’s rest (see Exhaustion, p151). Failure to properly sleep for multiple days incurs cumulative exhaustion
penalties (–1 per day).
Difficulty preparing spells: For each spell the character
attempts to memorise or pray for, there is a 1-in-6 chance
of failure. If the roll fails, the attempt to memorise or pray
for the spell fails—the spell slot remains empty and unusable this day.

Impossible: The character fails to get a good night’s rest.

Settlements
Where weary adventurers may rest, heal, and spend their hard-earned gold.

Settlement Procedure Per Day
1. Weather: The Referee determines the day’s weather,
using the tables in the Dolmenwood Campaign Book.
2. Decide actions: The players decide on their actions
for the day (e.g. resting, shopping, researching).
3. Random encounters: The Referee makes a check for
a daytime random encounter.
4. Description: The Referee describes what happens. If
an encounter occurs, follow the procedure described
in Encounters, p164.
5. End of day: The characters return to their lodgings.
The Referee updates time records, with special attention to durations of ongoing downtime activities (e.g.
spell research).
6. Random encounters: If characters are active at night,
the Referee makes a check for a nighttime random
encounter.

Actions

Settlements present a wealth of opportunities for characters weary from the hardships of adventure. Some of the
most common activities are as follows.

Arcane Study
Arcane spell-casters can learn new spells by studying
under a mentor or by a process of research. Learning spells
takes time and requires peace and quiet. See Arcane Magic,
p78 for full details.

Earning Money
Player Characters are professional adventurers, so they do
not usually have the training, equipment, or contacts to
make a living by other means.
Using Class capabilities: Adventurers may sometimes
wish to use the capabilities of their Class to earn a bit
of money on the side (e.g. bards performing in taverns,
thieves picking pockets at a market). Characters can earn
3d6sp per day in this way.

Gossiping
Characters spending time in taverns, drinking with local
folk may hear rumours of potential adventuring interest,
determined by the Referee.

Locating Specialists or Retainers
Characters may ask around to find specialists or retainers
for hire in the settlement. See Specialist Services, p132
and Retainers, p134.

160

Rest and Healing
A stay in a settlement is a perfect opportunity to rest and
recuperate, healing damage accrued during adventures.
Healing overnight: Characters heal 1 Hit Point per night
when staying in a settlement.
Full days of rest: A full day of rest allows a character to heal
1d3 Hit Points. Resting precludes activity more strenuous
than reclining in an inn, supping hot food and a soothing
beverage.

Shopping
Settlements provide all manner of useful businesses where
adventurers can replenish their stocks and spend their
coin. See Settlement Services.

Visiting NPCs
Characters may spend time visiting NPCs they know in the
settlement, discussing plans, business ventures, intrigues,
and goings on in the Wood.

Random Encounters

When PCs are active in a settlement (i.e. not simply resting
in an inn), there is a 2-in-6 chance of a random encounter
during the daytime and a 1-in-6 chance during the nighttime. This is in addition to any NPCs encountered at settlement locations (e.g. innkeepers, store owners, etc.).

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Settlement Sizes

Lifestyle Expenses (Optional Rule)

Settlements in Dolmenwood are classified into one of
five size categories, based on their population.

Instead of separately calculating the costs of inn lodgings and meals, characters’ living expenses may be
abstracted into a simple daily payment based on a
chosen standard of living. This can be especially useful
for extended periods of downtime, when characters’
day-to-day activities are not played out.

Settlement Services

The Dolmenwood Campaign Book describes the main
points of interest in each settlement, including the most
significant shops or services. In addition to any specific
services mentioned, the following common services are
available in most settlements.

Apothecaries and Herbalists
All settlements have a herbalist of one kind or another,
often an apothecary or a local hedge witch. Such people are
experts in the healing, magical, and poisonous properties
of herbs and fungi.
Buying fungi and herbs: See Common Fungi and Herbs,
p130.
Identifying fungi and herbs: For a 5gp fee, a herbalist can
examine and identify a specimen.
Selling fungi and herbs: Herbalists are often willing
to purchase useful (i.e. not poisonous) specimens from
adventurers at 50% of their normal value.

Banking and Money Changing

Wretched lifestyle: Sleeping in back alleys, begging,
and eating scraps. A wretched character does not heal
any lost Hit Points.
Poor lifestyle: Lodging in poor quality inns or rented
rooms in an older part of town.
Common lifestyle: Lodging in common quality inns
or a rented cottage in a quiet part of town.
Fancy lifestyle: Lodging in fancy quality inns or a
spacious, rented house in the nicest part of town.

Buying Property
Characters may sometimes wish to purchase property in a settlement. Use the price guidelines listed
for hiring a builder (see Specialist Services, p132).
Existing property usually costs 50–100% of the price
to build a new structure, depending primarily on the
building’s state of repair and location.

Buying and Selling Equipment

Businesses specialising in exchanging coinage and basic
banking services can be found in towns and cities.

Standard adventuring gear, weapons, and armour can be
bought (and sometimes sold) at small stores such as blacksmiths, carpenters, chandlers, leatherworkers, and so on.

Money changing: Coins of one kind can be exchanged
for coins of another kind of equivalent value (e.g. 1,000cp
exchanged for 10gp). The fee is 3% of the value of the coins
changed. (e.g. a 3sp fee for exchanging 1,000cp to 10gp.)

Buying equipment: Common adventuring gear, weapons, and armour can be bought at standard prices. Certain
items are only available in larger settlements (see Adventuring Gear, p116).

Safe storage: Funds can be left in a money changer’s safe,
with a token given to vouch for the money stored. This
service is free of charge if money is left for at least 1 month.
There is a 10% fee otherwise.
Loans: An item of double the value of the loan must be
left as a deposit. The fee is 10% of the value of the loan per
month. Well-known and respected characters (e.g. high
Level characters with land) may be able to get loans at a
lower interest rate and without a deposit.

Selling used equipment: Stores are often willing to
purchase used equipment from adventurers at 50% of its
normal value, as long as it is in good condition.

Buying and Selling Treasure
Gems, jewellery, and art objects can be bought and sold at
specialist jeweller’s stores in towns and cities.
Buying gems/jewellery: Jewellers sell items to adventurers at their full value.
Selling gems/jewellery: Jewellers purchase items from
adventurers at 80% of their full value.
Valuation (optional rule): It is generally assumed that
adventurers are able to appraise the value of treasures
themselves. If the Referee wishes to keep the value of gems
and jewellery secret, PCs may inquire at the store for a
valuation. The fee for this service is 3% of the item’s value.

Dungeons
Procedures for adventuring in ruins, caverns, and the depths of the underworld.

Dungeon Exploration Procedure Per Turn
1. Decide actions: The party decides what actions to
take (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering
rooms).
2. Wandering monsters: The Referee makes a check for
random encounters as applicable.
3. Description: The Referee describes what happens.
If monsters are encountered, follow the procedure
described in Encounters, p164.
4. End of Turn: The Referee updates time records, with
special attention to light sources, spell durations, and
the party’s need to rest.

What is a Dungeon?
The term dungeon is used to denote any underground,
indoor, or enclosed adventuring locale. Crystal
caverns, barrow mounds, abandoned mines, ruined
castles, enemy fortresses, giant worm tunnels, unhallowed crypts, and haunted manors are all examples of
dungeon locales.

Dungeon Levels

Dungeons typically consist of a series of floors or distinct
regions known as levels. Adventurers usually begin exploring the first level of a dungeon and may discover entrances
to the second, third, and further levels as they explore.
Dungeon levels are often connected by stairways, but
trap doors, chutes, chasms, pits, and magical portals also
sometimes provide means of moving between levels or
accessing secret areas.

Danger and Reward
Dungeon levels further from an entrance (e.g. deeper
underground) present greater challenges but also greater
rewards. More powerful monsters live in deeper levels
and guard more valuable treasure hoards. Generally, a
dungeon level presents suitable challenges and rewards
for characters of equal Level. For example, the first level
of a dungeon is suited to Level 1 characters.

Time

When exploring dungeons, game time is tracked in Turns
(around 10 minutes). See Time and Movement, p146.

162

Movement

Characters move at exploration speed: 3 times their Speed
in feet each Turn (or up to 10 times their Speed through
previously explored, fully mapped areas). See Time and
Movement, p146.

Established Safe Paths (Optional Rule)
To speed up play, the Referee may choose to accelerate
travel along safe, previously explored routes through the
dungeon, rather than playing out the whole journey on a
Turn by Turn basis.
1. Length: Gauge the length of the route.
2. Time: Calculate the number of Turns required to follow
the route: divide the route’s length in feet by 10 times
the party’s Speed.
3. Resources: Check that the party has sufficient resources
(e.g. light sources) to follow the route without incident.
If resources expire part way, resume play at the point
along the route where this occurs.
4. Wandering monsters: Make wandering monster
checks as appropriate for the number of Turns required
to follow the route. If a check results in an encounter,
resume play at the point along the route where it occurs.
5. Journey: Otherwise, describe the journey briefly without going into detail about each area traversed.

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Resting

Characters must rest for 1 Turn per hour (i.e. 5 Turns of
exploration, 1 Turn of rest) or become exhausted (see
Exhaustion, p151).

Sleeping in Dungeons
Dungeons are perilous places not conducive to sleep. When
adventurers become fatigued and their resources run low,
it is usually best to retreat to the safety of a settlement to
rest. However, adventurers may occasionally wish to camp
out in a dungeon.
Getting a good night’s rest: The rules for sleeping in the
wilds may be used (see Camping, p158), choosing a
season appropriate to the dungeon’s conditions. For example, a steamy, moss-carpeted dungeon might be treated
as summer, whereas a chilled crypt might be treated as
winter.
Campfires: Lighting a campfire for warmth is normally
impossible in an enclosed space, due to the smoke.
Wandering monsters: If adventurers set up camp in
a hidden or little-frequented corner of a dungeon, the
frequency of wandering monster checks may be reduced
(per the Referee’s judgement). See Wandering Monsters.
For example, camping behind a closed door in an out-ofthe-way area may entail a check once every 2 hours, while
camping in a secret room unknown to most dungeon denizens may entail only a single check while PCs sleep.

Food in Dungeons

Exiting the Dungeon
(Optional Rule)

Characters wishing to leave a dungeon must make their
way to a known exit to return to the safety of civilisation.
Rather than playing out the whole return journey on a
Turn by Turn basis, it is sometimes convenient to use an
accelerated procedure for exiting a dungeon. For example,
some groups prefer to end each session of play outside of
the dungeon, enabling a different group of characters and
players to reconvene in the next session. In such situations,
one of the following procedures may be used.

Option 1: Established Safe Paths
If players know of a safe, previously explored route to a
dungeon exit, the procedure listed under Movement may
be used.

Option 2: Dungeon Escape Roll
This option strongly encourages players to exit the
dungeon at the end of each game session. Characters who
do not exit the dungeon in a timely manner risk an uncertain doom determined by random rolls. Each character
must Save Versus Doom (with modifiers listed below) to
escape unscathed. If the save fails, the player must roll on
the Dungeon Doom table to determine their character’s
fate.
Dungeon level: –1 Saving Throw penalty for each dungeon
level beyond the first. (e.g. –3 penalty when exploring the
fourth level.)

The weird animals, plants, and fungi of the underworld
are sometimes edible—if adventurers dare to sample
them. Otherwise, it is advisable to bring rations on longer
dungeon expeditions (see Adventuring Gear, p116).

Mapped location: +2 Saving Throw bonus if characters
have a map indicating their location.

Spoilage: Fresh rations spoil and become inedible after 1
day in a dank environment (e.g. a typical dungeon), while
preserved rations last for 1 week.

Dungeon size: The Referee may apply a Saving Throw
bonus for very small dungeons or a penalty for especially
sprawling dungeons.

Clear path: +4 Saving Throw bonus if characters know a
safe, previously explored route to an exit.

Wandering Monsters

The typical chance of wandering monster encounters is
listed below. At the Referee’s discretion, some dungeons
may have higher or lower chances of wandering monsters.
See Wandering Monsters, p155 for more information.

Encounters
When adventurers meet strangers, foes, or monsters in the wilds.

Encounter Sequence
1. Awareness: The Referee establishes whether either
side is already aware of the other.
2. Surprise: The Referee rolls for surprise, if applicable.
3. Encounter distance: The Referee determines the
distance between the two sides.
4. Initiative: Any sides that are not surprised roll initiative to determine who acts first.
5. Actions: Any sides that are not surprised decide how
they will respond to the encounter. The encounter is
played out accordingly.
6. Conclusion: One Turn has passed.

Sides
Typically there are two sides in an encounter—a PC
adventuring party and a group of NPCs or monsters.
It is possible to have more than two sides in situations
where multiple independent groups meet.

Awareness

Sometimes one group is already aware of the other’s presence, negating the chance of being surprised. The Referee
should judge this based on the situation—e.g. a group
making a lot of noise or carrying a light in the dark usually
makes its presence known to others at some distance.
Example: An adventuring party exploring a dank cave
network approaches the cobweb-strewn lair of a giant spider.
The spider has spotted the approaching party’s torch light and
lies quietly in wait. The spider does not need to make a Surprise
Roll, but the party will.

Surprise

A Surprise Roll is made for any side that is not already
aware of the other’s presence. See Stealth, p154 for more
details on avoiding detection.
Surprise Rolls: Each side unaware of the other’s presence
rolls to see if they are surprised. One player rolls for the
adventuring party as a whole, and the Referee rolls for
each other side.
Chance of being surprised: The standard chance of a side
being surprised is 2-in-6. This may be modified in certain
situations. For example, attacking from hiding (see Stealth,
p154) increases the chance of the opposing side being
surprised by 1, to 3-in-6.

Effects of Surprise
Neither side surprised: Neither side has any advantage.
One side surprised: The unsurprised side gains a 1 Round
advantage, during which the surprised side cannot act.
Both sides surprised: There is simply a momentary confusion—neither side has any advantage.

Encounter Distance

The situation in which an encounter occurs often determines the distance between the two sides. If there is uncertainty, determine the distance randomly.
Dungeon: 2d6 × 10′. (1d4 × 10′ if both sides are surprised.)
Outdoors: 2d6 × 30′. (1d4 × 30′ if both sides are surprised.)

Effects of Encounter Distance
Awareness: Encounter distance indicates the distance at
which one or both sides (determined by surprise) become
aware of the other. This may be due to sighting, scent,
sounds of movement, and so on.
Direction: Unless the situation dictates otherwise, both
sides are headed roughly towards each other.

164

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Initiative

Initiative determines which side acts first in an encounter.
Initiative Rolls: Each side rolls 1d6. One player rolls for
the adventuring party as a whole, and the Referee rolls for
each other side.
Highest roll wins: The side with the highest roll acts first,
followed by other sides in order from highest to lowest
initiative.
Ties: Either both sides may roll again, or actions on both
sides may be resolved simultaneously.
Waiting: A side may choose to voluntarily lose initiative,
waiting to react to the other side’s actions.

Actions

The players decide their characters’ actions and the Referee
determines the actions of other sides (see Monster and
NPC Reactions). The following actions are common.

Attacking
If one side attacks, casts spells, or makes tactical movement, follow the procedure under Combat, p166. Use the
previously rolled initiative for the first Round of combat,
re-rolling in the second and subsequent Rounds.

Evasion
If one side wishes to avoid an encounter, it may attempt
to flee. The opposing side must decide whether or not to
pursue.
Surprise: If not obviously visible, a side with surprise may
avoid the encounter altogether by turning back, waiting
quietly, or attempting to sneak past.
Choosing to pursue: Players decide whether to pursue
fleeing monsters or NPCs. The Referee decides whether
monsters or NPCs pursue fleeing PCs, based on their disposition (possibly making a Reaction Roll—see Monster and
NPC Reactions). If the opposing side decides to let the other
side flee, then the encounter is avoided.

Monster and NPC Reactions
Circumstances often make it obvious how a monster
or NPC will react upon encountering adventurers. If
unsure, the Referee may make a Reaction Roll.
Reaction Rolls: Roll 2d6 on the Encounter Reactions
table to determine a creature’s initial disposition when
encountered.
Charisma: When parleying, the Charisma Modifier of
the speaking PC is applied to Reaction Rolls.

ENCOUNTER REACTIONS

3–5

Parley
A side may attempt to communicate with the other. If
PCs begin an encounter with an attempt to parley, the
Charisma of the speaking character can influence the other
side’s reaction. See Monster and NPC Reactions.

Waiting
A side may decide to wait to see how the other side acts,
essentially forfeiting any element of surprise or initiative
it may have had.

Conclusion

An encounter is assumed to take at least one full Turn to
complete, including time to rest, regroup, clean weapons,
bind wounds, and so on, afterwards.

Pursuit: If the opposing side gives chase, it is assumed that
both sides are running—moving at 3 times their Speed in
feet per Round (see Time and Movement, p146). Game
time proceeds in Rounds, with the location of the two sides
carefully tracked to determine their relative positions.
Ending a pursuit: A pursuit ends if the fleeing side is
caught or if the pursuing side decides to give up the chase.
Monsters often break off a pursuit if they lose sight of characters (as determined by the Referee).
Obstacles and distractions: The fleeing side may create
obstacles to block pursuit (e.g. burning oil) or drop items
to distract pursuers. Creatures that value wealth may stop
pursuit if characters drop treasure (3-in-6 chance), and
ravenous creatures may stop pursuit if characters drop
food (3-in-6 chance).

Combat
When swords are drawn and an encounter turns to violence.

Combat Procedure Per Round
1. Declarations: The intent to cast a spell, use a fairy
rune, or retreat from melee must be declared.
2. Initiative: Each side rolls 1d6 to determine which
side acts first. Highest acts first.
3. Winning side acts: Actions of combatants on the
winning side are handled in the following sequence:
a. Movement: Combatants may not move when
casting a spell.
b. Missile attacks: Fired or thrown attacks.
c. Magic: Spells, runes, glamours, magic items,
turning the undead.
d. Melee attacks: And other actions.
4. Other sides act: Repeat steps 3a to 3d for each side,
in order of initiative (highest first).
5. Morale: The Referee makes a Morale Check for
monsters and NPCs, if applicable.

Sides
Typically there are two sides in a combat encounter—a
PC adventuring party and a group of NPCs or monsters.
It is possible to have more than two sides in situations
where multiple independent groups meet.

In Melee
Two combatants are treated as being in melee if they are
positioned within 5′ and one or both has made a melee
attack against the other.

Time

During combat, game time is tracked in Rounds (about 10
seconds). See Time and Movement, p146.

Actions Per Round

Combatants may move and perform one action each
Round. Those wishing to cast a spell or use a fairy rune
may not move in the same Round.

Common Actions
The following count as a combatant’s action for the Round.
For other actions, the Referee must judge what is feasible
within the space of a Round.
▶ Make an attack.
▶ Cast a spell, use a rune, or use a glamour.
▶ Drink a potion.
▶ Activate a magic item.
The Referee may allow combatants to take momentary
actions (e.g. shouting a few words, dropping a held object)
in addition to their main action for the Round.

Declarations

Certain actions must be declared before initiative is rolled,
as they have consequences for the side that loses initiative.
Declaration applies to all combatants, whether controlled
by players or by the Referee.
Spells and runes: The intention to cast a spell or use a
fairy rune this Round must be declared. The spell or rune
is disrupted if the caster loses initiative and is harmed.
Fleeing from melee: The intention to flee from melee this
Round must be declared. Opponents that win initiative
may attack the fleeing combatant with a bonus.
Other actions: Need not be declared.

Initiative

Initiative determines which side acts first each Round.
Initiative Rolls: Each side rolls 1d6. One player rolls for
the adventuring party as a whole, and the Referee rolls for
each other side.
Highest roll wins: The side with the highest roll acts first,
followed by other sides in order from highest to lowest
initiative.
Ties: Either both sides may roll again, or actions on both
sides may be resolved simultaneously.
Waiting: A side may choose to voluntarily lose initiative,
waiting to react to the other side’s actions.

166

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Movement
When in Melee
Combatants can move up to half their Speed in feet per
Round.
Fleeing from melee: A combatant wishing to move at
greater than half Speed must turn and flee melee, forfeiting their attack this Round. Opponents in melee with a
retreating combatant gain a +2 Attack bonus against them
this Round and ignore any AC bonus from their shield.

Outside of Melee

Magic

Spells, fairy glamours, fairy runes, magic items, and turning the undead all take effect in this phase in the initiative
sequence.

Restrictions
Line of sight: Unless noted otherwise, the intended target
(a specific monster, character, or area of effect) must be
visible to the character.
Movement: Characters casting spells or using fairy runes
cannot move in the same Round.

Combatants can move up to their Speed in feet per Round.

Disrupting Spells and Runes

Fleeing an encounter: Combatants not in melee may flee a
combat encounter, beginning running movement (3 times
Speed in feet per Round—see Time and Movement, p146)
and using the rules for evasion (p165).

If a character casting a spell or using a rune is successfully
attacked or fails a Saving Throw before their side’s initiative, the spell or rune is disrupted and fails. Spells are
removed from the caster’s memory as if they had been
cast. Runes are treated as having been used.

Attacks

Melee attacks are possible when opponents are 5′ or less
from each other. Missile attacks are possible when opponents are more than 5′ from one another. See Attack Rolls,
p145 for full details on making an Attack Roll.

Attack Modifiers
Melee: Strength Modifier (also applies to damage).
Missile: Dexterity Modifier (not applied to damage).
Rear attacks: Negates AC bonuses from shields.
Missile range: Short: +1 Attack, Medium: no modifier,
Long: –1 Attack. Beyond Long range: attack not possible.
Missile cover: The Referee may apply Attack Roll penalties
of between –1 and –4 if a target is hiding behind partial
cover. For example, a small table might incur a –1 penalty,
dense woods might incur a –4 penalty. Targets behind full
cover cannot be hit.

Spacing
The Referee should judge the number of opponents that
can attack a single combatant, bearing in mind the combatant’s size and the available space around them.
10′ wide corridors: Have sufficient space for at most 2–3
characters to fight side-by-side.

Morale

If a battle is going against them, combatants may decide
to retreat, flee, or surrender. Players always make this
decision for their characters, but the Referee may roll to
determine if monsters or NPCs break morale.
Morale Checks: Roll 2d6. If the result exceeds the combatant’s Morale, their morale breaks and they try to surrender
or flee in the next Round. Otherwise they keep fighting.
One check per side: Typically a single Morale Check is
made for all members of a side, rather than one check per
individual.
When to check Morale: The first time a combatant on the
same side is killed, and when half of the side has been killed
or defeated. For a creature encountered alone, a Morale
Check should be made when it is first harmed and when it
is reduced to 1/4 or less Hit Points.
Two successes: If a combatant makes two successful
Morale Checks in an encounter, they will fight until killed,
with no further checks necessary.
Morale 12: Combatants with Morale 12 fight to the death,
never rolling a Morale Check.
Situational modifiers: The Referee may apply modifiers
(from –2 to +2) to combatants’ Morale.

167

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Other Combat Matters
Optional extra combat rules covering more specialised situations.

T

he combat rules on p166 cover the most
common situations that occur when an encounter turns to violence. The rules presented here
provide guidelines for handling more unusual or specialised situations. All are optional and only used at the Referee’s discretion.

Fighting in Water

Attacking With Two
Weapons

Melee weapons: Weapons designed to chop, slash, or
bludgeon (e.g. axes, swords, maces) are ineffective underwater. Thrusting weapons (e.g. daggers, spears) function
normally.

Characters with Dexterity or Strength as a Prime Ability
may choose to wield two one-handed melee weapons, gaining the ability to make an extra attack each Round.
Primary weapon: Attack Rolls with the primary weapon
suffer a –2 penalty.
Secondary weapon: The secondary weapon must be of
Small size (e.g. a dagger or hand axe). The character may
make one extra attack per Round with the secondary
weapon, at a –4 penalty to Attack Rolls.

Charging into Melee

Once per combat, a combatant may charge into melee and
attack, as follows.
Declaration: Charging must be declared before initiative
is rolled.
Charge: The combatant must move at least 20′ before
attacking. There must be a clear run.
Effects: The combatant gains a +2 Attack bonus this Round,
but their AC is penalised by –1 this Round.

Land-dwellers are at a disadvantage when fighting in or
beneath water—they are unaccustomed with moving and
attacking in water, and their weapons are often unsuited.
Penalties: Land-dwellers suffer a –2 penalty to Attack and
Damage Rolls when fighting underwater.

Missile weapons: Ineffective underwater.

Invisible Opponents

Melee attacks: Melee Attack Rolls against an invisible
opponent suffer a –4 penalty.
Missile attacks: It is usually not possible to target an invisible creature with missile attacks.
Defending: Invisible creatures gain a +4 bonus to Attack
Rolls against opponents that cannot perceive them.

Missile Fire Into Melee

The constant and unpredictable movement of melee makes
firing or throwing missile weapons at melee combatants
an uncertain proposition.
Attack penalties: The Attack Roll is penalised by –1 for
each combatant in melee with the intended target (to a
maximum penalty of –4).

Brace weapons: Weapons that may be braced against a
charge inflict double damage on the charging combatant—
see Armour and Weapons, p118.

Natural 1s: Optionally, on a natural 1 Attack Roll, the
Referee may rule that the missile hits a randomly determined combatant in melee with the intended target,
inflicting damage.

Death’s Door

Non-Lethal Attacks

The standard rule is that a character reduced to 0 Hit Points
dies immediately. Groups wishing to reduce the risk of
death may rule that when a character is reduced to 0 Hit
Points, rather than being dead, they linger at death’s door.
Effects: A character at death’s door is unconscious and
will die without magical aid. Each Round, there is a 2-in-6
chance of the character dying.
Aid: Healing that takes effect instantaneously (e.g. Lesser
Healing, Spirithame, magic potions) saves a character if
applied before they perish, restoring them to 1 Hit Point.
Characters brought back from death’s door suffer a permanent loss of 1 point from a random Ability Score.

168

Any melee attack may be made with the intent to subdue
or restrain an opponent, rather than killing them.
Non-lethal damage: Handle Attack and Damage Rolls as
normal, but track non-lethal damage separately. If accrued
non-lethal damage equals or exceeds a combatant’s
current Hit Points, they are subdued or knocked unconscious.
Bladed weapons: Bladed melee weapons can deal non-lethal blows by attacking with the flat of the blade. This
incurs a –2 Attack penalty and reduces damage by half.
Healing: Non-lethal damage heals at a rate of 1 point per
Level per hour. For example, a Level 4 character recovers
4 points of non-lethal damager each hour. Magical healing can also be used to heal non-lethal damage, with any
excess points restoring lost Hit Points as normal.

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Paralysed Opponents

Switching Weapons

Parrying

Unarmed Attacks

Helpless opponents, such as those magically paralysed or
frozen, can be automatically hit in melee without an Attack
Roll. Only a Damage Roll is required.

Instead of attacking (or performing another action) in a
Round, a combatant may opt to act solely defensively.
Declaration: Parrying must be declared before initiative
is rolled.
Armour Class bonus: The parrying combatant adds their
Strength Modifier or +1 (whichever is greater) to their AC
against all melee attacks that Round.

Pushing

A combatant may attempt to push past an opponent (for
example, someone blocking a doorway) or to push them
back (for example, someone fighting close to a cliff edge).

Unless a combatant simply drops their current weapon on
the ground, switching weapons is treated as the combatant’s action for the Round (i.e. instead of attacking).

Some monsters do not wield weapons, using their natural
unarmed attacks (claws, horns, bites, etc.) instead. Humans
and other characters may make unarmed melee attacks by
punching, kicking, and so on.
Damage: Unarmed attacks inflict 1d2 damage, plus the
character’s Strength Modifier.

Unstable Surfaces

Combatants on an unstable surface, such as a ship in rough
waters or riding a flying animal, are affected as follows.
Note that magical means of flight (e.g. the Fly spell) generally do not count as unstable.

Push attack: The attacker makes a melee Attack Roll with
a –4 penalty.

Missile attacks: Suffer a –4 Attack penalty.

Effects: Instead of suffering damage on a successful attack,
the defender must Save Versus Hold. If the save fails, the
attacker may choose to move past the defender or to push
the defender 5′ back.

Magic items: Can be used normally.

Spells: Cannot be cast.

Opponent size: If the defender is significantly larger than
the attacker, the Referee may grant a +4 bonus to their
Saving Throw. If the size difference is extreme, a push
attack may simply be impossible.

Splash Weapons

Splash weapons—for example burning oil or holy water—
are containers that smash on contact, dousing the victim
in a dangerous liquid. (See Armour and Weapons, p118.)
Targeting a creature: A splash weapon may be thrown at a
single creature. This is handled as a normal missile attack
against the target’s Armour Class.
Targeting a surface: Alternatively, a splash weapon may be
thrown so that it smashes on a hard surface close to one or
more creatures. This is handled as a missile attack against
Armour Class 10. If the attack succeeds, all creatures within
5′ of the targeted surface are splashed with the liquid and,
if it is harmful to them, suffer one-quarter normal damage
(rounded up).

Misses
When a splash weapon misses its target (whether a creature or a surface), the Referee may determine the actual
location where it smashes.
Direction: Roll 1d12 to determine the direction, interpreting the roll as a clock-face direction.
Distance: The container smashes 10′ from the intended
target in the specified direction.
Damage: Creatures within 5′ of this location are splashed
with the liquid. If it is harmful to them, they suffer
one-quarter normal damage (rounded up).

Example of Combat
Demonstrating how the rules and procedures of combat work in play.

E

mily (playing Grendl Lockehorn, a Level 3 breggle
knight), James (playing Samwise Lank, a Level
3 human friar), and Jeff (playing Boots Pouncemouse, a Level 3 grimalkin enchanter) have been accosted
in their campsite by a knight atop a strange mount. Once
again, Gavin as the Referee sets the scene.
Gavin: You catch the scent of freshly cut roses and hear
the padding of feet as a huge dormouse bounds out of the
forest in front of you. A tall, lithe figure with hair the colour
of the midnight sky and twinkling with stars sits astride
it—bareback, no less! He’s clad in plate armour that looks to
be crafted from living ivy. He wears no helmet and wields
a sword in his left hand. As his pupilless silver eyes fall
upon you, he cries out as if he were singing a song, “Stand
and deliver, ye knaves and interlopers. Ye stand before a
Knight of the Goblin Rhymers and must render unto me
that which is due my master!”
James (playing Samwise): I knew it! They have been tracking us.
Gavin: It looks like it, yeah. The knight leaps off his strange
mount with a flourish, clearly intent on battle. <Gavin
starts following the combat procedure—p166.> Before
we roll Initiative, does anyone want to cast a spell? <No
characters are in melee currently, so declaring retreats
isn’t on the cards.>
James: Yes I want to cast Mantle of Protection. One question. I know it’s technically another person, but does the
protection extend to Rosemary since I’m carrying her?
Gavin: <Thinking for a second, since Rosemary has been
more of a story MacGuffin than an independent character>
Hmmm... yeah, sure. She’s small. It’ll protect her as well as
long as you keep holding her close.
James: Great.

Emily: Speed 20. So I can get to the knight this Round.
<Double-checking the optional charging rule> Yep, and 20′
of movement is enough to do a charge attack. He’s not holding a brace weapon, so he can’t hit me with double damage.
Gavin: Good stuff. So you charge him, lowering your head
to get a good aim with your horns. As you’re charging,
you’ll get a +2 Attack bonus when we come to the melee
phase, and you suffer a –1 AC penalty this Round as you’re
rushing in recklessly. Next up would be missile attack, but
you both said you wanted to use magic, so let’s go straight
to your side’s magic phase.
James: Yep, so I cast Mantle of Protection as I said.
Jeff: And I want to use my Conjure Treats glamour to entice
the giant dormouse and prevent it from attacking us.
Hoping it’s a mortal animal and can be affected.
Gavin: Alright, so James you say your prayer to St Benester
and your protection spell takes effect. It lasts for 12 Turns,
so we’ll just cross off 1 Turn after the combat finishes. Jeff,
you gesture toward the giant dormouse and a wheel of
cheese appears in your hand!
Jeff (as Boots): “Mousy mousy, come and get it!”
Gavin: The giant dormouse looks imploringly between
your cheese and its master. I’ll make a Morale Roll to see
whether it goes for the tasty treat or stays loyal to the
knight. <Gavin is using the DMB giant rat stat block for the
dormouse, with double normal Hit Points and +1 Attack. He
rolls 2d6, scoring a 7—just under the dormouse’s Morale
score of 8. The beast remains loyal.> The dormouse licks
its lips but turns its attention towards Grendl charging its
master. Sorry Jeff, that was a great idea.
Jeff: Ah too bad. Makes sense though. Not everyone favours
fine cheese over mortal combat.

Jeff (playing Boots): I want to use a glamour, but that
doesn’t count as casting a spell, right? It can’t be disrupted.

Gavin: Ha, right. So that was your side’s magic phase. Now
the moment everyone’s been waiting for—melee attacks!
Go for it Emily.

Gavin: That’s right, so you don’t need to declare it before
we roll Initiative. OK let’s roll Initiative then. <Gavin rolls
a d6 for the enemy side—the knight and the dormouse.>
I got a 4.

Emily: <Making an Attack Roll. She rolls a d20, adding +2
for being a Level 3 knight, +2 for charging, and +2 for her
Strength of 16, for a total of +6 to the roll.> An 18 total!

Emily (playing Grendl): I’ll roll for us. Yes, 5! We go first.
Oh, it is on!
Gavin: Great, so movement first. Do any of you want to
move this Round? You’re all standing about 20′ away from
the knight and his steed.
Emily: Yes I’m totally going to move! I lower my head and
make a charge attack at Sir Fancy Pants with my horns.
Gavin: Excellent, decisive action! Anyone else moving?
<James and Jeff shake their heads.> What’s your Speed
Emily?

170

Gavin: <Checks the Armour Class of the elf knight stat
block in the DMB—AC 17.> The knight attempts to parry
the incoming horns, but is taken aback by the breggle’s
burst of aggression and you slam into his side. It’s a hit—
roll damage!
Emily: <Rolls 1d4+1 for the horn damage, adding +2 for her
Strength modifier> Nice, a total of 6 damage!

P a r t S e v e n | Ad v e n t u r i n g

Gavin: <Updates the elf knight’s current HP—he has 15 HP
left.> He staggers back with an “oof” and cries out “Toothtipper! Attack!” OK that’s your side’s actions wrapped up
for the Round. Now your enemies get to act. They’re both
going to attack Grendl as she’s the one who started the fight
and she’s right next to both of them. I’ll roll the knight’s
attack first. <Rolls a d20, adding +5 for the knight’s sword
attack, as listed in the DMB.> 14! What’s your AC Emily?
Emily: 16, plate mail with no Dexterity or shield bonus.
Oh minus 1 for having charged this Round, so 15. Still not
enough. Better luck next time!
Gavin: You deftly dodge the knight’s blow, only to find the
great fangs of the dormouse coming at you. <Rolls a d20,
adding +1.> Whoa, 18! That’s one vicious rodent. Toothtipper blindsides Grendl, biting her shoulder from the flank.
You take <Gavin rolls 1d3> 3 damage.
Emily: Just a scratch. <Updates Grendl’s current Hit Points
on her character sheet.> 16 HP left.
Gavin: Both sides have acted now, so it’s the next Round.
Any spells or retreats from melee to declare?
Emily: I’m staying put. Can either of you jump in and help
with this dormouse?
Jeff: Sure, I can try to stab Toothtipper while it’s distracted
trying to eat Grendl. I was thinking of firing at it with my
crossbow, but I don’t want to risk hitting Grendl.
James: Am I close enough to Grendl to cast a touch spell
on her?
Gavin: Not really. She’s a good 20′ away, and you can’t move
and cast a spell in the same Round.
James: Alright. Then I’ll get close enough that I can touch
her or Boots next Round, but still hold my staff across the
arm where I’m carrying the baby.
Gavin: Oh yeah. Rosemary bursts into tears and is loudly
wailing in your arms, Samwise. It doesn’t look like either
of your opponents is retreating, so let’s roll Initiative.
Jeff: I’ll roll this time. Nice, I got a 6!
Gavin: Well, I got a 1. You guys go first again. So Jeff you
wanted to move up to attack Toothtipper, and James you
wanted to move up to be in a position to cast a spell next
Round, right?
James: Yep, I’ll get just behind Grendl.
Jeff: Yep, I’m going for that big tasty mouse! Oh, I just
remembered, I heal if I eat a giant rodent.
Gavin: Alright so you’re both in position now. I don’t think
anyone wanted to do any missile attacks or magic, so let’s
go to the melee attacks phase. Make your Attack Rolls
Emily and Jeff.
Emily: If Jeff’s gonna deal with the vermin, I’m gonna
attack Sir Fancy Pants again. <Rolls d20 + 6.> Aw crap, 12, I
doubt that’s enough.
Gavin: Nope, the blow glances off his armour. It looks like
ivy, but protects like steel.

Jeff: OK here goes, against the dormouse. <Rolls d20,
adding +1 for being a Level 3 enchanter.> Also a 12.
Gavin: <Checking the DMB giant rat monster entry> That’s
a hit! Dormouse fur isn’t quite as tough as plate mail.
Jeff: Nice! That’s <rolls 1d6> 3 damage with my shortsword.
Gavin: <Updates the dormouse’s current HP—it has 2 HP
left.> You get a really good blow, slicing down its side. The
dormouse squeals in pain but keeps fighting. You think
another blow like that would kill it. OK I think everyone’s
gone now, right? So it’s the enemies’ turn to act now. Toothtipper is going to continue gnawing on Grendl, while the
Knight of the Goblin Rhymers uses the distraction to move
past her and make an attack on Samwise in the hopes he’ll
drop the child.
Emily: Hey! Can’t I block him from moving around me?
Gavin: Well, strictly speaking he can move up to half
his Speed and remain in melee, so he’s not disengaging
exactly. Samwise is right behind you, so the knight only
has to manoeuvre 5 or 10 feet around you.
Emily: Fair enough. Maybe think twice about getting so
close to me in melee next time Samwise!
Gavin: I’ll roll Toothtipper’s attack on Grendl first. <Rolls a
d20, adding +1. He gets a total of 12, missing.> Toothtipper
suddenly realises there’s a large anthropomorphic fairy
cat right next to him and is more than a bit distracted. Its
teeth glance off the armour protecting your arm, Emily.
The knight moves to intercept Samwise, trying to slay him
with one quick thrust of his sword that appears crafted
from goblin teeth bound and sharpened to a razor’s edge.
<Rolls a d20, adding +5 as noted in the elf knight’s entry in
the DMB. He rolls an 18, for a total of 23!> Oof, what’s your
AC James?
James: Uh oh, only 12. Oh... is the knight Chaotic by any
chance? If so my Mantle of Protection gives me AC 13.
Gavin: Yep, he’s affected by the spell. But I rolled a 23, so
it’s still a hit. You jerk aside to avoid injury to the child,
Samwise, but the sword pierces your shoulder. Take <rolls
1d8+2> 8 damage.
James: <Updates Samwise’s current HP> Argh, I only have
10 Hit Points! I’ve got 2 HP left, but there’s no way he’s
getting this baby. I didn’t do anything after moving up.
Can I smack him with my staff? Remember, I had the tips
capped with cold iron, and he’s a fairy...
Emily: Oh, nice!
Gavin: I mean, technically, your side’s actions are over
for the Round, but since you didn’t take an action, then
sure, you can go at the end, after everyone else. Make an
Attack Roll.
James: <Picks up the d20> Here we go...
Will Samwise defeat the already wounded elf knight? Will
they escape with the baby Rosemary? Why did the Knight of
the Goblin Rhymers want her? Fate and free will are mired
in mystery when one wanders beneath the eaves of Dolmenwood...

“

ortals are a strange lot. They act as though they
own both this world and whatever their religions
say comes in the hereafter. They refuse to take the
world as it is, always trying to bend it to their will, whether by
the sword or by some elusive claims of universal truth. It’s all
quite comical watching them chase their own tails in the name
of enlightenment. What fools these mortals be!”

Dolmenwood Calendar
The reckoning by which the folk of Dolmenwood track the passing of time.

A

printable calendar PDF, designed for use by the
Referee in tracking events and the passage of
time in Dolmenwood campaigns, is available as
a free download from dolmenwood.com.

The Year

The common reckoning of time in Dolmenwood divides
the year into 12 months of 7-day weeks and a total of 352
days. The lunar cycle is 29⅓ days, yielding precisely 12 lunar
months per year.
Days of the week: Each week has 7 days, named as follows:
Colly, Chime, Hayme, Moot, Frisk, Eggfast, Sunning.
Wysendays: Some months have additional days—known
as Wysendays—with their own unique names. Wysendays
are not regarded as being part of a week.
Months: Each month contains 4 standard weeks, followed
by any Wysendays. The first day of the month is always
Colly. The Months of the Year table shows the months,
their place in the procession of the seasons, their lengths,
the names of their Wysendays, and the name given to the
moon that waxes and wanes within each.

Festival of the Green Man (30th of Reedwryme, Druden
Day): A relic of ancient worship in Dolmenwood. The Green
Man was at one time honoured as King of the Wood. In
modern times, that title is given to the Nag-Lord, who is
believed to have slain the Green Man and brought woe
to Dolmenwood. This festival pays memorial to the slain
king through the hanging of manikins of moss and wood
by their ankles in the branches around villages.
The Hunting of the Winter Hart (30th of Braghold,
Dolmenday): On this night, a white fairy stag of great
nobility and beauty rushes through Dolmenwood. Villagers throughout the forest ride into the woods and return
at the twilight of dawn. If the Winter Hart is caught, it is
said that winter will be banished for a year.

Moon Signs
(Optional Rule)

Characters born in the mortal world (i.e. mortals and demifey—excluding fairies such as elves and grimalkins) come
inevitably under the sway of the moon’s potent magical
influences.

Feast days

Waxing, Full, and Waning Moon Signs

The Feast of Cats (2nd of Symswald): For reasons lost to
the vagaries of time, the people of Dolmenwood associate
cats with the first blossoms of spring. Thus, their spring
dances are accompanied by screeching fiddle tunes and
all are masked as cats.

Determining a Character’s Moon Sign

A multitude of local festivities are celebrated in obscure
hamlets and out-of-the-way villages of Dolmenwood, but
the following dates are observed throughout the region.

The Feast of St Clewyd (25th of Reedwryme): The patron
saint of Dolmenwood, in whose honour unicorn-effigies
are burned atop bonfires and pheasants and partridges
baked into spiced pies.

Each moon of the year has different effects during its
waxing phase (around 13 days), its full phase (around 3
days), and it waning phase (around 13 days). Therefore there
are 36 moon signs in the year.

Optionally, during character creation, roll on the Moon
Signs table. The result indicates the moon and phase under
which the character was born, along with the associated
influence. Unless noted otherwise, the effects of a character’s moon sign are permanent and unalterable.

Noble Houses of
Dolmenwood
The nine noble families that hold dominion over Dolmenwood.

House Brackenwold
Alignment: Lawful.

Domain: The Duchy of Brackenwold, encompassing the whole of Dolmenwood (at
least notionally) as well as a large region to the south. The domains of all other listed
noble houses fall within the duchy.
Seat: Castle Brackenwold, upon the south-eastern verge of Dolmenwood.
Head: Duke Thespian III of Brackenwold. A troubled man who, it is said, would prefer
to spend his days hunting rather than presiding over a great realm. It is known that
the duke harbours a deep hatred of the Drune and a growing fear of the Nag-Lord.

House Guillefer
Alignment: Neutral.

Domain: A region of forest on either side of the Lochsbreth Road, in north-eastern
Dolmenwood, encompassing the villages of Blackeswell, Meagre’s Reach, and Odd.
Seat: The Hall of Sleep, located at the north-eastern end of the Groaning Loch.
Head: The nobles of this house share rulership on a sporadically rotating basis.
The current ruler, Edwin Guillefer, is a poet and harpist, and is said to be a friend of
Ygraine the sorceress. He remains untroubled by the waxing of the Nag-Lord’s influence in the region, to the consternation of his neighbour, the Lady Harrowmoor.

House Harrowmoor
Alignment: Lawful.

Domain: A broad region of forest at the heart of Dolmenwood, stretching from the
town of Prigwort in the east to the shores of Lake Longmere in the west.
Seat: Harrowmoor Keep, located on the southerly cliffs of the Groaning Loch.
Head: Lady Theatrice Harrowmoor. A famed intellect and expert on matters historical, Lady Harrowmoor is cool-headed but not cold-hearted. Of late, she has taken
more direct involvement in the affairs of Prigwort, bolstering the town guard
against the growing presence of crookhorn ruffians in the area.

House Hogwarsh
Alignment: Neutral.

Domain: The Barony of the High Wold, encompassing the long-settled south-western corner of Dolmenwood and the rustic pastures to the south. The domains of
houses Malbleat, Murkin, Nodlock, and Ramius fall within the barony.
Seat: High-Hankle, located in the central plains of the High Wold, in the south-east
of Dolmenwood.
Head: Baron Sagewine Hogwarsh. Inherited the lordship of the High Wold as a
callow youth. Now in his thirties, Hogwarsh is known for his lax attitude to the law,
being more interested in wine and debauchery than in the maintenance of order.

176

P a r t E i g h t | App e n d i c e s

House Malbleat
Alignment: Chaotic.

Domain: The eastern portion of the High Wold region in the south-east of Dolmenwood, encompassing the towns of Lankshorn and Dreg.
Seat: Redwraith Manor, located in the woods four miles north of Lankshorn.
Head: Lord Gryphius Malbleat, longhorn breggle. A refined aesthete known for his
cruelty and his bitter enmity toward his elder half-brother, Lord Ramius.

House Mulbreck
Alignment: Lawful.

Domain: The woods and meadows of southern Dolmenwood, east of the River
Hameth, encompassing the Woodcutters’ Encampment.
Seat: Bogwitt Manor, located in the south-eastern corner of Dolmenwood.
Head: Lady Pulsephine Mulbreck. A reclusive lady who seldom sets foot outside of
her manor and permits no guests to enter. It is said that she remains in mourning
over the death of her husband a decade past.

House Murkin
Alignment: Chaotic.

Domain: The rugged, little-travelled lands west of Dolmenwood, within the Barony
of the High Wold, bounded by the marshes of the Northern Scratch.
Seat: Kolstoke Keep, located on the western edge of Dolmenwood.
Head: Lord Simeone Murkin, a boorish and cruel-tempered man of mixed breggle/
human parentage. Murkin’s only passions are conquest and military dominance.

House Nodlock
Alignment: Neutral.

Domain: A small pocket of pasture and woodland at the far south-western tip of
Dolmenwood, within the Barony of the High Wold.
Seat: Nodding Castle, located on the south-western edge of Dolmenwood.
Head: Lord Harald Nodlock. A slovenly man renowned for his love of wine (at all
hours of the day), his volatile mood, and his proclivity for spontaneously meting
out justice. Nodlock is said to be a lackey of his neighbour, Lord Ramius.

House Ramius
Alignment: Neutral.

Domain: The western deeps of Dolmenwood and a small portion of the grasslands
upon its south-western verge, within the Barony of the High Wold.
Seat: Castle Everdusk, located two miles into the woods in the High Wold region in
the south-east of Dolmenwood.
Head: Lord Shadgore Ramius, longhorn breggle. A brilliant mind, known for his
subtle strategies and far-reaching ambition. Resents the meddling Baron Hogwarsh
for granting his younger half-brother, Lord Malbleat, dominion over much of the
High Wold.

Religion in Dolmenwood
The faiths and spiritual practices of the mortal folk of Dolmenwood.

R

Pluritine Church Hierarchy

Pluritine Church

Archbishop: Per land.

eligious practices play a daily role in the lives of
many among the mortal Kindreds of Dolmenwood. An overview of the religious beliefs of
humans, breggles, and mosslings is presented here.

The major hierarchical ranks within the Church are
as follows, along with the Levels of PC clerics/friars
regarded as being of roughly equivalent rank.

The dominant religion in Dolmenwood, sanctioned as
the official religion of the Duchy of Brackenwold. Most
humans in Dolmenwood are adherents of the Church, to
one degree or another.

Bishop: Per major region of each land.

Deities: A nameless, male god, only referred to by the
epithet “the One True God.” God’s true name is regarded as
ineffable. Daily practice focuses on venerating the host of
saints—exalted people who performed mighty and miraculous deeds in the service of the Church, now said to act as
intermediaries between mortals and God.

Vicar: Per settlement. Level 3+ PCs.

Origin: The Pluritine Church originated 1,600 years ago, in
a land far from Dolmenwood, when the five prophets (Ogrimund, Hogrish, Elidine, Lacrimyde, and These) received a
vision of the cosmos and the struggle of all living beings.
The prophets travelled the world to spread word of their
vision—that the gods of all religions are falsely named
aspects of One True God, who should not be named or
depicted. After 17 years of proselytising, the prophets
ascended to heaven without knowing mortal death.
Cosmology: The Church teaches that God created the
mortal world, the paradisical realm of heaven, and the
accursed realm of hell. He populated the mortal world with
humans, other mortal Kindreds, and animals. He created
angels to serve Him in heaven and devils to torment the
damned in hell. Lastly, God created the world of Fairy to
demonstrate the folly of life without faith and salvation.
Tenets: Depiction or naming of God is heresy. Sentient
life is sacred and must be protected and nurtured. Evil
deeds are to be punished, but free will is fundamental. Each
individual must be free to choose a life of evil (and eternal
damnation in hell) or good (and eternal reward in heaven).

Commander: Three (one per Holy Order) under each
bishop. Level 10+ PCs.
Abbot / Archdeacon: Per abbey or city. Level 6+ PCs.
Curate: Several serve each vicar. Level 1+ PCs.

Practices: Daily prayer to a patron saint. Weekly visits to
church for communal prayer (traditionally on Sunning).
Pilgrimage to cathedrals or holy sites.
Holy symbols: A circle with five rays descending from it,
representing God and the five prophets. This symbol is
known as the Chapes. Symbols of the three clerical orders
(p61) and effigies of individual saints are also common.
Holy texts: The most holy text—known as the Pragmaphon—recounts the visions, lives, and apocalyptic prophecies of the five prophets. Lesser bodies of text also exist
around most of the saints, recounting their deeds and
teachings.
Membership: The Church has a strict hierarchy of priesthood—see Pluritine Church Hierarchy. Clerics and friars
serve the Church in wild and dangerous lands.
Relationships: While all Kindreds are welcomed into the
faith, most adherents and officials are humans. The Pluritine Church, prevalent in many human domains beyond
Dolmenwood, is a monotheistic, evangelistic religion that
seeks to convert all to its faith. While usually undertaken
with compassion, this urge to convert others has historically led to conflict (sometimes bloody) with other religions and nations. This, in turn, has led to the persecution
of adherents of the Pluritine Church in certain lands.

Gwyrae

The old religion of the human folk of Dolmenwood, before
the arrival of the Pluritine Church (around 1,200 years
ago) largely swept it away. Gwyrae is an Old Woldish word
meaning “sacred glade.”
Deities: A pantheon consisting of dozens of deities—called
Wood Gods—of greater or lesser importance. They are
regarded as manifestations of the spirit of Dolmenwood.
In modern times, the Green Man—god of feast, ale, revelry,
and hunting—is the only Wood God that remains prominent in folkloric memory.
Origin: Lost to time.
Cosmology: Remnants of Gwyrae mythology can be found
in local folk belief in Dolmenwood. For example, locals still
speak of a “world tree” on which all known realms of existence are placed, with Fairy as the tree’s root. Belief in reincarnation into plants or animals also lingers in folklore.
Tenets: Lost to time.
Practices: A number of folk practices in Dolmenwood can
perhaps be traced back to Gwyrae: for example, the belief
in a state of merry inebriation as a means of communion
with greater powers.
Holy symbols: The symbol of the Green Man—a cruciform oak—can still be spied carved on old buildings or in
graveyards that were appropriated by the Pluritine Church.
In ancient times, adherents would wear cruciform or
Y-shaped pendants of oak wood or root, but such symbols
are seldom seen in the present day.
Holy texts: None known.
Membership: It is said that the witches of Dolmenwood
still worship the old gods in secret.
Relationships: The Pluritine Church suppresses any
remnants of Gwyrae. Otherwise, as a virtually dead religion, it has little contact with other faiths or folk.

Aud frengd Hlerr

The system of ancestor worship practiced among breggles.
The name roughly translates as “praising the ancestors.”
Deities: None. A multitude of ancestors are venerated,
ranging from personal family members to great heroes
of myth. The semi-mythical ancestor Hraigl is commonly
revered, as mother of the longhorn noble houses.
Origin: The practice of revering ancestors originates in
the Passions of Ghrygaile—the tale of an ancient breggle
warrior-chieftain who attributed his glory in battle to the
aid of his ancestors, who fought by his side.
Cosmology: Aud frengd Hlerr teaches that the world (this
includes Fairy) is a testing ground. Individuals who prosper
and honour their families gather in an afterlife of eternal
feasting, along with their ancestors. Those who lead craven
or spiritless lives enter a dismal realm of torment where
their souls are annihilated by gnawing worms.
Tenets: Honouring and furthering the position of ones
family is utmost. Personal misdeeds can be redeemed by
sufficient propitiation of the ancestors.
Practices: Daily prayer to ancestors. Occasional sacrifices
of valuables to ancestors. Pilgrimages to the graves of
venerated ancestors.

Cults of the Nag-Lord
According to rumour, cults venerating the wicked
Nag-Lord have begun to spring up in the wild places of
Dolmenwood. It is said that crookhorns, monsters, and
even corrupted humans gather to worship the twisted
King of the Wood and further his evil plans.
Holy symbols: A ring of horns, often those of honoured
ancestors.
Holy texts: The Hlerrllaindr—a set of books recounting
the deeds of the most esteemed breggles.
Membership: Most breggles practice Aud frengd Hlerr.
There is no formal priesthood.
Relationships: Breggles regard Aud frengd Hlerr as a
philosophy of living, rather than a religion per se. It is not
contradictory to also follow another religion, for example
the Pluritine Church. The cosmology of Aud frengd Hlerr
is broadly compatible with that of the Church.

Mogba

The traditional religious practices of the mosslings of
Dolmenwood, called Mogba in their own language (meaning something like “holy decay”).
Deities: A multitude of deities of the deep forest and fecund
underworld, too numerous to list in full. Each settlement
has its own local deity, and many homes have their own
god of the cauldron, trough, or compost heap. All are
regarded as inhabiting the mortal world as divine siblings,
part of a pantheon. Some of the most widely known deities
are Mbombre (the clay god), Blosquom (fungal god of the
village of Orbswallow), and Splobgra (the worm god).
Origin: Mogba goes back to the unrecorded mists of time
in Dolmenwood. Mossling mythology does not speak of a
founder of the religion.
Cosmology: Visions sent by the Mogba deities reveal
that the world sits atop a cosmic puffball on the back of a
toad named Hwogra. At the end of time, the puffball will
explode, releasing the spores of the next cosmic cycle.
Tenets: The cycles of nature are sacrosanct, especially
those around ageing, death, and decay into the soil. Individuals are but temporary manifestations of the whims of
the soil. The unfathomable mystery of life is to be savoured.
Practices: Psychedelic communion with the Mogba deities.
Questing to consult with mould oracles. Fertilising sacred
plants with the compost of beloved ancestors.
Holy symbols: A toadstool with one or more eyes.
Holy texts: The evolving body of myths and legends known
as Hwogm is primarily passed down orally, but the mould
oracles do maintain written copies of various vintages.
Membership: Mould oracles act as hermit-priests and
spiritual guides. Otherwise, there is no formal religious
structure.
Relationships: Mogba is virtually unknown to other
Kindreds and the religion has nothing to say on the subject
of the religions of other folk.

Playing a Kindred-Class
Some players prefer the option of a simple archetype
for non-human Kindreds, for example playing a breggle as opposed to a breggle bard or a breggle knight. If
this option is preferred, the player should ignore the
Kindred traits presented on p32. The character only
has the traits listed here.

Arcane Magic

Upon attaining longhorn status (from Level 4), breggles
begin to study arcane magic. See Arcane Magic, p78 for
full details on arcane magic, including learning spells, spell
memorisation, and the list of spells that breggles can learn.
Spell casting: The Breggle Spells Per Day table shows the
number of spells a breggle may memorise, determined by
the character’s Level. For example, a Level 6 breggle may
memorise at most two Rank 1 spells and one Rank 2 spell.
Learning spells: A longhorn does not automatically know
any spells and must learn spells from a mentor, from
discovered spell books, or by research.
Using magic items: Breggles of Level 4 or higher can use
magic items that may only be used by arcane spell-casters
(for example, magic scrolls of arcane spells).

when unarmoured or wearing Light armour.

Gaze

Upon attaining longhorn status (from Level 4), a breggle
character can use their gaze to charm humans and shorthorns into obeisance.
Activating: The longhorn must gaze intently at an individual human or shorthorn.
Effect: If the target fails a Save Versus Spell, they are
charmed to view the longhorn character with awe and
respect. While charmed, the target is unable to harm the
longhorn, either directly or indirectly.

Duration: Until sunrise the following day.
Resisting: The holy spell Mantle of Protection counters a
longhorn’s gaze.
Usage frequency: A longhorn may use their gaze a limited
number of times per day, depending on their Level—see
the Breggle Advancement table. The gaze may be used on
a specific subject at most once a day.

Horns

Breggles may make a melee attack with their horns instead
of a weapon. The damage inflicted increases with Level, as
indicated in the Breggle Horns table.

Horn Length and Social Standing
A breggle character begins play as a commoner of the
shorthorn caste aspiring to improve their lot in life. As
they advance in Level, gaining experience, wealth, and
renown, their horns grow (see the Breggle Horns table).

Longhorn Status
Upon reaching Level 4, a breggle character’s horns have
grown to the point that the character is recognised as a
longhorn.

being able to use scrolls and other arcane magic items and
possessing secret runes granted to them by the lords of
Fairy.

Playing a Kindred-Class
Some players prefer the option of a simple archetype
for non-human Kindreds, for example playing an elf as
opposed to an elf enchanter or an elf thief. If this option
is preferred, the player should ignore the Kindred traits
presented on p36. The character only has the traits

Elf Skills

Elves have a Skill Target of 5 for Listen and Search. They also
have one additional, specialised skill. The Elf Skill Targets
table lists the character’s Skill Targets as they advance in

Detect Magic
An elf can attempt to detect the subtle resonances that are
woven into an enchanted object, place, or creature. If the
attempt succeeds, the elf knows if the object, place, or creature being focussed on is magical—i.e. enchanted, affected
by a spell, or possessed of innate magic of some kind.
Requirements: The elf must touch the object, place, or
creature to be analysed and must be able to concentrate
without distraction.
Time: Each attempt to detect magic requires 1 Turn.
Retrying: The elf may retry failed attempts as often as they
wish, each attempt requiring an additional 1 Turn.
Referee rolls: The Referee rolls all Detect Magic Checks,
so that players do not know if the roll failed or if there is
no magic present.
Downtime: Given an hour of solitude in a safe location,
an elf can automatically detect magic on an object, place,
or creature.

Fairy Runes

Elves are granted the use of fairy runes—the secret, magical sigils guarded by the rulers of Fairy. As a character
advances, fairy nobles may be drawn by the elf’s great
deeds and grant new runes. See Fairy Magic, p92 for
details on the fairy runes.
At Level 1: An elf knows one randomly selected rune of
lesser magnitude.
Subsequent Levels: Each time the character gains a Level,
the player should roll for the chance of acquiring a new
rune. See Learning Runes, p92.

Glamours

Elves possess minor magical talents known as glamours
(see p94). The number of glamours known is determined by the character’s level as shown in the Elf Advancement table. Known glamours are determined randomly.

Immortality

Elves can be killed but do not die naturally. They are
immune to diseases of non-magical origin. Elves also
cannot die of thirst or starvation, though a lack of sustenance drives them desperate and sadistic (see p153).

Magic items

Elves have a natural affinity for the arcane and are able to
use magic items that may only be used by arcane spell-casters (for example, magic scrolls of arcane spells).

Resistance to divine aid

The saints of the Pluritine Church are loath to aid those
allied with the godless world of Fairy. If an elf is the subject
of a beneficial holy spell, there is a 2-in-6 chance of it having
no effect.

Unearthly beauty

Elves—both benevolent and wicked—are beautiful by
mortal standards. When interacting with mortals, an elf
gains a +2 bonus to Charisma (to a maximum of 18).

Vulnerable to Cold iron

As fairies, cold iron weapons inflict +1 damage on elves.
(e.g. a cold iron shortsword would inflict 1d6+1 damage on
an elf, rather than the standard 1d6).

Armour Tailoring

Pick Lock

Defensive Bonus

Time: Each attempt to pick a lock requires 1 Turn.

Armour must be tailored to grimalkins’ small size (see
Tailoring Armour, p119).

In melee with Large creatures, grimalkins gain a +2 Armour
Class bonus, due to their small size.

Eating Giant Rodents

After spending 1 Turn devouring a freshly killed giant
rodent, a grimalkin heals 1 Hit Point.

A successful check allows a grimalkin to open a lock without the key. Thieves’ tools are required for picking locks
(see Adventuring Gear, p116).
Retrying: The grimalkin may retry failed attempts as often
as they wish, each attempt requiring an additional 1 Turn.
Difficult locks: The Referee may rule that certain locks
are more difficult. These may incur a penalty to the Pick
Lock Check or only allow a fixed number of attempts, after
which the grimalkin is stymied and can only try to pick the
lock again after gaining a Level.

Fur Balls (Thrice a Day)
During the day after eating a giant rodent, a grimalkin
may sacrifice 1 Hit Point to spew up a violent stream of
congealed fur, spittle, and bone. All creatures in a 30′ line
suffer 1d6 damage (Save Versus Blast for half).

weapons, pick locks, or use glamours.
Equipment: All gear carried is optionally transformed with
the character, reappearing when they return to humanoid
form.

Chester (Unlimited Usage)

may make a bite and two claw attacks each Round. Each
attack inflicts 1 point of damage.
Speech: The character can understand language, but can
only respond in wordless yowls and meows.
Changing back: Takes 1 Round. Only possible when the
grimalkin is unobserved by any other sentient being.

Wilder (Once a Day)
Entering wilder: A grimalkin may only transform into
wilder when in melee and at less than half of their maximum Hit Points. On entering wilder, the character heals
2d6 Hit Points.
Near-invisible: Only the grimalkin’s deranged eyes are
visible. Opponents who cannot see the invisible suffer a –2
penalty to Attack Rolls against the grimalkin. Those who
can see the invisible discern a bulky feline form, 3′ high,
with a leering grin and fur standing electrified on end.
Combat: The character has Armour Class 13, Speed 30, and
may make a bite and two claw attacks each Round, with a
+2 bonus to Attack Rolls. Each attack inflicts 1d4 damage.
Fey chaos: The grimalkin cannot distinguish friend from
foe, indiscriminately attacking the nearest creature.
After 2d4 Rounds: The grimalkin instantly returns to their
humanoid (estray) form.

Vulnerable to Cold iron

As fairies, cold iron weapons inflict +1 damage on
grimalkins. (e.g. a cold iron shortsword would inflict 1d6+1
damage on a grimalkin, rather than the standard 1d6).

ossling adventurers have a number of useful
capabilities related to fungi and possess minor
magical talents known as knacks.

Playing a Kindred-Class
Some players prefer the option of a simple archetype for
non-human Kindreds, for example playing a mossling
as opposed to a mossling fighter or a mossling hunter.
If this option is preferred, the player should ignore the
Kindred traits presented on p48. The character only
has the traits listed here.

Starting Equipment
Armour (roll 1d6): 1. Leather armour. 2. Leather armour +
shield. 3. Bark armour. 4. Bark armour + shield. 5. Pinecone
armour. 6. Pinecone armour + shield.
Weapons (roll 1d6 twice): 1. Club. 2. Dagger. 3. Sling + 20
stones. 4. Shortbow + 20 arrows. 5–6. Shortsword.

Armour

Armour must be tailored to mosslings’ small size (see
Tailoring Armour, p119). Mosslings prefer non-metal
armour, and manufacture special suits of armour from
hardened bark and pinecones.

Fungal symbiosis

From Level 4, a mossling may spend 1 Turn to attempt
to enter into a symbiotic agreement with a non-hostile
monstrous fungus.
Level limit: The fungus must be at least 3 Levels lower than
the mossling. For example, a Level 6 mossling is limited to
symbiosis with fungi of Level 3 or lower.
Chance of success: To determine whether the symbiosis
is successful, the mossling must Save Versus Spell. If the
save succeeds the symbiotic pact is agreed.
Once per fungus: Entering into a symbiotic agreement
may be attempted only once per fungus.
Successful symbiosis: Spores from the fungus infest
the mossling’s body, blooming after 1d4 days into fungal
growths riddled throughout their skin and organs. The
mossling may subsequently activate any special trait or
power of the fungus up to once a day per 2 Levels (e.g. up
to 4 times a day at Level 8). Any special attack or defence
forms of the fungus may be activated, including magical
powers. The mossling is immune to any harmful effects.
One symbiosis only: It is not possible to initiate simultaneous symbiosis with multiple fungi, and the only way to
reverse or cancel a symbiosis is by use of magic (e.g. the
holy spell Cure Affliction).

Mossling Skills

Mosslings have a Skill Target of 5 for Survival when foraging.

Knacks

Mosslings practice carefully guarded, quasi-magical crafts
known as knacks. Each mossling knows one knack, rolled or
chosen at character creation. See Mossling Knacks, p112.

Resilience

Mosslings are hardy and resilient like the gnarled bole of
an old tree, as indicated by their saving throws. Mosslings
gain an additional +2 bonus to Saving Throws against
fungal spores or poisons.

Symbiotic Flesh

As a mossling ages, their dank, fertile flesh picks up seeds
and spores which germinate into symbiotic plants and
fungi. At each Level (including Level 1), the character
acquires a random trait from the Symbiotic Flesh table.
Duplicates may be re-rolled or taken to indicate an amplification of the trait.

Playing a Kindred-Class
Some players prefer the option of a simple archetype for

as opposed to a woodgrue bard or a woodgrue thief. If
this option is preferred, the player should ignore the
Kindred traits presented on p52. The character only
has the traits listed here.

Armour Tailoring

Armour must be tailored to woodgrues’ small size (see
Tailoring Armour, p119).

Compulsive jubilation

A woodgrue who witnesses a party, feast, celebration, or
festival must partake; they are utterly compelled with
every fibre of their being. If, for some reason, a woodgrue
wishes to resist this compulsion, they may Save Versus
Spell (but feel drained and downtrodden for the length of
the engagement).

Defensive bonus

In melee with Large creatures, woodgrues gain a +2 Armour
Class bonus, due to their small size.

Mad revelry

Once per day per Level, a woodgrue may play one of the
enchanted melodies listed below on a wind instrument
while hooting and dancing terribly.
Subjects: All living creatures within 30′ (including allies)
must Save Versus Spell or be afflicted by the melody. Fairies and demi-fey gain a +2 bonus to the Saving Throw.
Duration: The effects of the melody last as long as the
woodgrue keeps playing. While playing, the woodgrue
may move but cannot attack or perform other actions.
Disrupting: If the woodgrue is harmed or fails a Saving
Throw, they stop playing. Subjects who are harmed or fail
a Saving Throw likewise cease to be affected.

Enchanted Melodies
Confide: Subjects speak in a slurred voice, confessing some
deeply hidden emotion or revealing an ally’s secret.
Dance: Subjects begin dancing a profane, nonsensical jig.
Those affected gain a +1 bonus to Armour Class, but cannot
move from the spot where they dance.
Imbibe: Subjects ravenously consume any liquids (potable
or not), herbs, mushrooms, and such like that are available
and proceed to act as though drunk, suffering a –2 penalty
to Attack Rolls until the revelry ends.
Jape: Subjects mock the immediately preceding occurrence, be it a deed of words or acts.

Moon Sight

A woodgrue can see in darkness up to 60′, viewing the
world as though it glows in faint moonlight. This does
not incur low light penalties (p150), but fine detail (e.g.
writing) cannot be perceived.

Musical Instruments

A woodgrue can employ a musical instrument as a melee
weapon, doing 1d4 damage.

Vulnerable to Cold iron

As demi-fey, cold iron weapons inflict +1 damage on woodgrues. (e.g. a cold iron shortsword would inflict 1d6+1
damage on a woodgrue, rather than the standard 1d6).

Woodgrue Skills

Woodgrues have a Skill Target of 5 for Listen. They also have
one extra specialised skill. The Woodgrue Skill Targets table
lists the character’s Skill Targets as they advance in Level.

Stealth
Hiding: A woodgrue may make a Stealth Check to remain
undetected when shadows are the only cover available. See
Hiding and Ambushes under Stealth, p154.

Jubilate: Subjects burst into irrepressible laughter, preventing them from speech. There is a 1-in-6 chance each Round
of falling over in a laughing fit.

Sneaking: If a Surprise Roll indicates that a woodgrue’s
party has been detected, the woodgrue may make a Stealth
Check to remain undetected. See Surprise, p164 and
Sneaking under Stealth, p154.

Mount: Subjects attempt to mount nearby creatures, be
they friend or foe, and ride them piggyback (Save Versus
Hold to resist being mounted). Unaffected creatures may
Save Versus Hold once per Round to buck off a rider.

WOODGRUE SKILL TARGETS

Revel: Subjects cannot speak; instead they bark out terrible
scats of sound, in an attempt to keep up with the woodgrue’s maddening melodies. Speed is halved if subjects are
not headed in the direction of the woodgrue.

Setting Conception

Dolmenwood was originally conceived by Gavin Norman
and Greg Gorgonmilk in 2013. It was partially developed in
the Wormskin zine (2015–2018), before being fully realised
in the Dolmenwood Player’s Book, Dolmenwood Campaign
Book, and Dolmenwood Monster Book.

Inspiration

Thanks to the originators of early Dungeons & Dragons—
Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson, John Eric Holmes, Tom Moldvay, Steve Marsh, Dave Cook, Frank Mentzer—upon whose
work the rules of Dolmenwood are founded.
Thanks to Jeff Rients and Justin Alexander for the concept
of the Dungeon Doom table (p163).

A dv en t ur e a nd Per il in Fa iry ta le Wo od s
The complete player’s guide to the beguiling realm of
Dolmenwood—a moss-clad forest on the borders of
Fairy, rife with intrigue, secrets, and magic. Step then,
bold and foolhardy adventurer, into the tangled Wood
and beware, for little here is as it seems.

D

olmenwood is a weird fairy tale adventure game, conjuring
the wonder, horror, whimsy, and strangeness of British
folklore. Included in this book:

▶An introduction to the intrigues and mysteries of Dolmenwood.
▶6 Kindreds: goat-headed breggles, starry-eyed elves, tricksome
grimalkin cat-fairies, everyday humans, fungus-riddled mosslings,
and bat-faced woodgrues.
▶9 Classes: bard, cleric, enchanter, fighter, friar, hunter, knight,
magician, and thief.
▶4 kinds of magic: mighty arcane workings, fairy glamours and
runes, holy prayers to the saints, and the odd knacks of mosslings.
▶Flavourful equipment with lists of adventuring gear, arms,
mounts, hounds, tavern fare, beverages, pipeleafs, fungi, and herbs.
▶Complete game rules,
rules, including easy-to-follow procedures for
travel, camping, foraging, dungeon delving, encounters, combat,
and downtime.

Core book 1 of 3. Referees also need the Dolmenwood
Campaign Book and the Dolmenwood Monster Book.
Contains adult themes and elements of horror.
May not be suitable for children.

Secrets of
Dolmenwood

I

“

’ve been to the ends of the Wood and back and I’ve
seen a lot, bless my burls. More than you’d believe.
And you’d be right to think me a liar, because truth’s
a tricksy thing in Dolmenwood. But let me tell you something:
there’s more secrets under the eaves of Dolmenwood than
you or I could experience in a dozen mortal lifetimes. Standing stones older than time itself, ley lines flowing like the lifeblood of the earth, shrines praising mysterious saints, and the
tumbled ruins of ancient Elfdom. You start from the seeming
safety of your village, but before long you find yourself walking
a fairy road, stepping through a fairy door, and you’re nothing
more than another local legend told to younglings before they
slip off into dreamland.”
—Gombly Smallcheese, mossling hunter

Part One | Secr ets of Dolmenwood

Welcome, Master
of Dolmens
The scroll of lore is unfurled, and the telling of Dolmenwood begins.

W

ith the contents of this book, the Referee is
equipped to run long-term campaigns within
the moss-draped bounds of Dolmenwood.
Adventure of all kinds lurks beneath the forest’s eaves,
enabling campaigns of serious depth or frivolous fun. The
Referee may weave tales of lost treasure, looming war,
wicked fey revenge, perilous magic, and free-wheeling
antics from the warp of Dolmenwood’s lore. Read on then,
sagacious Master of Dolmens, and begin to set the story
in motion.

The World Around Dolmenwood
This book describes the forest of Dolmenwood and its
immediate surroundings in great detail, but does not
detail the wider world beyond the Wood. This makes
it easy for the Referee to insert Dolmenwood into a
wider campaign world of their choosing, if desired (see
p89). This is entirely optional, however, as there
is enough material in this book to run a long-term
campaign fully within the bounds of Dolmenwood,
without ever detailing the world beyond.

Starting Play

When starting a new campaign in Dolmenwood, the
following steps are recommended:
1. Read the Player’s Book first: Make sure you are familiar with the content of the Dolmenwood Player’s Book,
which presents an introduction to the realm of Dolmenwood and its denizens.
2. Background reading: Next, read the first two sections
of this book (Secrets of Dolmenwood and Factions and
Powers). It is also useful to read through the Referee
advice in Running a Campaign.
3. Choose a starting date: Decide whether the campaign
begins in the spring, summer, autumn, or winter. See
Seasons and Unseasons, p110. Then select a date.
4. Choose a starting settlement: Take a look at the
campaign map and select a settlement for PCs to start
in. If the PCs are outsiders entering Dolmenwood for the
first time, a good option is to start with them approaching Lankshorn (p156) or Castle Brackenwold (p128).
If the PCs are natives to Dolmenwood, Prigwort (p174)
and Dreg (p140) make for good starting locales.
5. Read settlement info: Read the description of the
selected settlement, focussing on the overview, the map,
and the most important NPCs.
6. Read nearby hexes: Read the descriptions of the hex
in which the starting settlement is located and the six
surrounding hexes, with a focus on the opportunities
for adventure that they present.
7. Place adventures (optional): Locate any dungeons or
adventure modules that you intend to integrate into
the campaign in hexes close to the starting settlement.
A short starter adventure—Pipes on Droomen Knoll—is
found on p434. Necrotic Gnome also publishes a line
of official Dolmenwood adventures, for example the
introductory adventure Winter’s Daughter.
8. Prepare rumours: In addition to any explicit hooks
to the selected starter adventure, note three or four
rumours to feed the players in the first session. These
can be drawn from the Rumours section (p440), the
desires of NPCs in the settlement, or potential sites of
interest in nearby hexes.
9. The first session: Begin with the PCs approaching the
starting settlement, seeking lodgings and rumour of
adventure. Allow the players to soak up the flavour of
the settlement, meet NPCs, and sample local fare, while
slowly introducing the prepared hooks and rumours.
Before long, players will follow up on one or more of the
rumours, and your campaign is under way.

Part One | Secr ets of Dolmenwood

Regions
The regions into which mortal folk divide the Wood and what lies in each.

Aldweald

Prigwort (Hex 1106)

East of the Hameth: The eastern region of Dolmenwood—
with the exclusion of the fungal forest of Mulchgrove—is
known as Aldweald. This region is bounded on the west by
the River Hameth and on the north by the Valley of Wise
Beasts.

Population: 2,800.

Civilised and well-travelled: In Aldweald, Dolmenwood
is at its most settled, with the well-maintained Horse-Eye,
Swinney, and Fort Roads connecting the stronghold town
of Castle Brackenwold (hex 1508) with the military outpost
Fort Vulgar (hex 0604), via the market town of Prigwort in
the centre of the Wood (hex 1106).

Fine ales and spirits: Prigwort is especially famed, even in
the wider region of the Duchy, for its breweries and distilleries. Fine Prigwort spirits, flavoured with the wild herbs
of the forest, are found on the tables of connoisseurs far
and wide.

Don’t stray from the path: If one sticks to the roads and
settlements, Aldweald is a relatively safe place to travel.
However, as is the way in the whole of Dolmenwood, stepping but a short distance from the structures of human
civilisation brings one into contact with the wider weird.
Tricksome fairies of all kinds are rife in the glades of
Aldweald, weird ley energies crisscross the region, and
witches congregate in secret to worship their obscure gods.

The Groaning Loch
Just over a mile wide at its widest point (in hex 1204), 15
miles long, and of unfathomed depth, the cold waters of
the Groaning Loch divide the human-realm of south-eastern Dolmenwood from the weird reaches of the northern
woods (the Valley of Wise Beasts, the Fever Marsh, and the
domain of the Nag-Lord).

Ruined Abbey of St Clewyd (Hex 0906)
Relic of past glory: East of Lake Longmere, in the depths
of Dolmenwood, a great monastery was founded, of old,
in honour of the revered St Clewyd. A century past, an
ill-judged ritual of communion with the dead went horribly awry, opening a dimensional rift in the abbey’s crypts
and bringing about its utter destruction.
Ghosts and treasures: Weird energies wrack the crypts of
the abbey still, thwarting any attempts to restore the place
to its former glory. Many treasures—including lost holy
relics—remain untouched in the ruins.

8

Bustling trade: The most populous settlement beneath the
eaves of the forest, the town of Prigwort is the centre-point
of trade in the region, situated halfway along the road that
connects Castle Brackenwold and Fort Vulgar.

The consulting wizard: Of interest to adventurers, it is
also known that a magician of commercial bent makes his
home within the town. See Mostlemyre Drouge, p180.

Odd (Hex 1403)
Population: 90.
Halfway to the wild north-east: A small settlement
halfway along the old road that marches proudly out of
Prigwort and creeps to a halt at the threshold of Chateau
Mauvesse, home of Ygraine the sorceress (hex 1802).
Uncertain name: Odd is the name given to this huddle
of dwellings by those that live outside of it. The villagers
themselves seemingly refer to their home by a different
name every time outsiders arrive.
Drune spies and rituals: The place is under the control of
the Drune, who have spies among the villagers and hold
the keys to the barricaded church, wherein they conduct
nighttime rituals around the monolith that forms the
spire.

Meagre’s Reach (Hex 1703)
Population: 120.
Returned from the dead: An odd, archaic village of dark
brick houses, situated in the seldom-trod north-east of the
Wood. Meagre’s Reach was once a plague-decimated ruin,
but was rescued (after a fashion) by the powerful dimension-twisting magic of the sorceress Ygraine.
Lost in time: The place now exists in a hazy bubble of
history, half a real village in the present day, half a memory
of its heyday some centuries past.

Part One | Secr ets of Dolmenwood

Aldweald

Dwelmfurgh

Dwelmfurgh

Lake Longmere

Rocky highlands: The wild, western reaches of Dolmenwood consist of a stony highland of treacherous slopes,
rocky outcroppings, and fast-running falls and rivers,
cascading down to Lake Longmere.

The great lake at the heart of Dolmenwood. See p11.

Drune heartland: This is the heartland of the Drune,
self-proclaimed masters of the ley lines and standing
stones of Dolmenwood.

Guards Lake Longmere: A run-down palisade and keep
overlooking the northern end of Lake Longmere. The Fort
was constructed following the banishment of the Cold
Prince and is (poorly) maintained by Sir Osric the Gaunt—a
vassal of the Duke of Brackenwold—and a small retinue of
mounted knights, boatmen, and domestic servants.

Ringed by standing stones: The region of Dwelmfurgh
is demarcated by a vast ring of standing stones. The
arcane potency of this ring is such that the encircled area
possesses supernatural qualities quite distinct from the
rest of the forest. In the parlance of modern folk, the sisterstones that make up the ring are called the “Summerstones” and the great ring itself is called the “Witching
Ring” (though, in truth, the ring of stones is in no way
related to the witches of Dolmenwood).
Ward against the Cold Prince: The origin of this enchanted
section of the Wood lies in deep antiquity, at a time when
the Drune conspired with the Church and the King to
banish the erstwhile fairy ruler of the forest—the Cold
Prince—from the mortal world forevermore. The stones
and the ring maintain the ban to this day, and are carefully guarded by the Drune, in case the Cold Prince should
attempt to reclaim his dominion of old.

Fort Vulgar (Hex 0604)
Population: 90.

Docks and shanty town: The Fort stands at the mouth of
Quogg’s Creek as it empties into Lake Longmere. Trade
boats from the north unload their goods onto wagons
for transport on to Prigwort (for no ships ply the haunted
waters of Lake Longmere). A cluster of shacks and cottages
has accumulated here, forming a dock-side hamlet catering
to the needs of weary sailors.
Taxation: Sir Osric assesses and collects taxes from all
boats and barges that dock here—a not insubstantial sum!

Effects of the warding ring: See The Ring of Chell, p20
for further details on the ward and the stones that bound it.

9

Part One | Secr ets of Dolmenwood

Fever Marsh

Stagnant lowland: A lowland pocket of cold, stagnant
marsh pooled at the foot of the Table Downs, feeding the
roots of Dolmenwood’s northern tangle.
Outcasts, fairies, and fungi: The place is home to a scattering of strange outcasts, recluses, and hermits, along with
an unsettling profusion of bog-fairies and malicious fungi.
Remnants of ancient habitation: In spite of the current
state of this region, ancient earthworks and burial mounds
attest to the fact that humans once dwelt here.

Hag’s Addle

Treacherous swamp: Hag’s Addle is the name given to
the region of mazy swampland that clogs the banks of
the River Hameth as it drains from Lake Longmere into
southern Dolmenwood.
The Hag: This place is shunned not only due to the natural hazards of the stinking marsh, but also because of
tales of the Hag who haunts its sodden expanse (see The
Hag, p82). The foolhardy or desperate sometimes seek
consultation with the Hag, as she has the power to see into
the past and future and to raise the dead, though the price
she demands in return is perilous.
Magical herbs: Adventurers dare to explore Hag’s Addle on
occasion, as the place is rich with magical herbs.

Woodcutters’ Encampment (Hex 1109)
Population: 180
Once-famed foresters: A small township on the verge
of the swamp, situated on the eastern bank of the River
Hameth. The people of the village were once famed for
their expertise in forestry, though these arts have now
devolved into little more than a cursory tradition.

Rule of law faltering: Of late, the barony has become
somewhat wild, under the lax rule of the Baron Hogwarsh:
bandits and highwaymen ply their trade with increasing
boldness, charlatans peddle brews and compounds of
questionable morality, and the hand of the Drune claws
ever southwards.

High-Hankle (Hex 0512)
Population: 5,300.
Capital of the High Wold: The seat of administrative power
in the High Wold lies to the south of Dolmenwood, amid a
region of windswept grasslands and rolling hills.
Town of hedonism: The baron is renowned for his lax attitude to the law, more interested in wine and debauchery
than in the maintenance of order. High-Hankle has thus,
in recent years, become a favoured haunt for jaded nobles
and hedonists of all stripes.

Lankshorn (Hex 0710)
Population: 1,100.
Threshold to Dolmenwood: The northernmost settlement in the High Wold, the market town of Lankshorn lies
within a bowshot of the forest’s border, acting as one of the
two main “thresholds” into Dolmenwood (the other being
Castle Brackenwold, in the east).

Trading port: In recent times, the people of the Encampment have grown rich and indolent on the profits of trade:
the village operates a port ferrying goods to Dreg. This
forms an essential part of the trade route connecting Castle
Brackenwold with Lankshorn and the High Wold.

Superstitious folk: Lankshorn is regarded as a cultural
oddity by outsiders, as the traditions of the civilised south
meld with the quaint, superstitious ways of Dolmenwood.
The respect Lankshorners hold for the longhorn nobles of
the wood is an apt example of the cultural melange in this
border-town.

The High Wold

Master bladesmith: The finest bladesmith in the High
Wold makes his home in Lankshorn.

Northern reach of a wider barony: The corner of Dolmenwood that lies south of Lake Longmere and west of the
River Hameth is part of a larger region, known as the High
Wold, that extends south of the forest for some further
forty leagues. The region is a barony under the dominion
of the Duchy of Brackenwold.
Independent spirit: This area of wild, rolling hills and
rustic meadows has been long inhabited. The folk who now
dwell there regard themselves, indeed, as the original and
true inhabitants of Dolmenwood.
Intermarriage of breggle and human aristocracy: The
High Wold has an unusual political structure, peculiar to
this region, whereby the land and titles of the longhorn
aristocracy are respected by the humans of the region.
Marriage of breggle and human nobles is commonplace.

10

Dreg and Shantywood Isle (Hex 1110)
Population: 300.
The port of Dreg: A rough port-town and fishing village on
the marshy banks of the Hameth. Dreg has a seedy reputation as a haunt for thieves, charlatans, and rascals of all
stripes.
Shantywood Isle: Dreg’s reputation is made only worse (in
the eyes of right-minded outsiders) by its proximity to the
island of Shantywood, a notorious port of ill repute run by
the seductive and ruthless Madame Shantywood.
Pubs and sausages: Aside from its profusion of public
houses and gambling dens, Dreg is known for its fine
sausages, made from the flesh of the swine kept in the
bogs to the north of the village.

The High Wold

Lake Longmere

The Heart of the Wood: The great lake Longmere—15 miles
long and 12 miles broad at its widest point—is known colloquially as “the Heart of the Wood.”
Ancient magic: The waters of Longmere were once home to
a mighty dragon-spirit named Gheillough (p37), which
now lies in an enchanted torpor.
Haunted waters: Locals now shun Lake Longmere, as the
place is haunted by Gheillough’s twisted dream-double—
the monster Big Chook (hex 0606), whose mind-melting
wailings assault those who venture onto the waters.
Relics of the Cold Prince: Two sites of great importance to
the Cold Prince—the fairy who ruled over Dolmenwood in
days long past—are situated upon the shores of Lake Longmere. Firstly, the ruins of Hoarblight Keep, his palace and
court, overlook the western banks (hex 0505). Secondly,
the fairy embassy to the human kingdom of old lies hidden
behind the torrent of the Falls of Naon (hex 0504). Both of
these sites hold many secrets of the past.

Mulchgrove

Bogs and fungal forest: The southern central region of
the Wood is a dank lowland riddled with fungal forests,
treacherous bogs, and twisted willow-woods.
Home of the mosslings: Mulchgrove is little traversed by
any save the mosslings who are native to the place, loving
fungi and moulds and all that is dank.

Magical and monstrous fungi: Mulchgrove is a paradise
for mycologists, as a profusion of magical fungi can be
found there. Many an adventurer comes to Mulchgrove on
a fungus-foraging errand for a herbalist or witch, seeking
rare specimens, while hoping to stay out of the clutches
of the fungal monstrosities that also lurk in the region.

Blackeswell (Hex 1604)
Population: 90.
Former mining town: Once a thriving mining town,
exporting the rare metal Hag Iron, the exhaustion of the
mineral veins left Blackeswell isolated among the foetid
fungus of Mulchgrove.
Isolated bog town: Among humans, the village of Blackeswell is nigh forgotten—a curiosity that may be spotted
on old maps. Nevertheless, a small number of devout folk
eke out a living from the bogs, trading with mosslings and
the occasional pedlar who passes their way.

Orbswallow (Hex 1405)
Population: 80 mosslings.
Heart of mossling culture: The largest mossling settlement in Dolmenwood.
Fine cheeses and pipes: Orbswallow is centred around
three venerable and magical trees, whose produce—fine
cheeses, oils, pigments, and high quality smoking pipes—is
famed throughout the Dolmenwood region.

11

Part One | Secr ets of Dolmenwood

The Table Downs

Windswept range of hills: The northern edge of Dolmenwood opens onto a range of high, windswept hills called
the Table Downs.
Relics of ancient habitation: A smattering of hamlets
and farms once huddled in the valleys of these hills, and
fortresses were built atop them. All now stand abandoned.
Haunted hills and deathly silence: Only phantoms and
the incessant moaning of the wind now break the stillness
of this place. Travellers may walk the old roads that cross
the hilltops, if they dare disturb the silence of the Downs.

Drigbolton (Hex 0702)
Population: 40.
Rustic goatherds: Desperately clinging to existence in the
borderlands between the forest and the Table Downs, the
hamlet of Drigbolton is home to a few dozen goatherds and
an old wooden church.
Ancient crossroads: Drigbolton sits near the junction of
two forgotten roads: an ancient trade road at the foot of
the Downs and an abandoned road that once led to Fort
Vulgar (hex 0604), passing through the plague town of
Midgewarrow (hex 0703).

The Tithelands

Bountiful farmland: Dolmenwood can be best described
as a borderland, where the civilised and wild meet. The
rolling expanse of bountiful farmland to the south-east of
the Wood is wholly within the realm of human dominion,
under the vigilant eye of Castle Brackenwold, looming
upon a high hill on the verge of the forest.
End of the Weird: Travellers along the gentle country lanes
of the Tithelands encounter a profusion of the mundane:
toiling farmers, conniving merchants, steadfast soldiers,
and pious clergy. The weird of Dolmenwood ends here.

The Nagwood

Atanuwë’s dominion: A stretch of twisted woods that
lies between Quogg’s Creek and the Avernal Lake, to the
north, and the Valley of Wise Beasts to the south. This is the
realm of Atanuwë, the wicked nine-legged unicorn godling
known in folklore as the Nag-Lord. The monster squats in
this region of Dolmenwood, oozing out its Chaotic taint
into the roots and waters of the forest.
Crookhorns and evil trees: None who value their lives
venture here, for the place is overrun by corrupted breggles
known as crookhorns, under the Nag-Lord’s command. The
trees themselves are hostile to intruders, and the place is
under a sorcerous malaise that twists the mind.

Northern Scratch

Windswept bog: At the far north-western extent of
Dolmenwood, the trees dwindle, giving way to a disputed
region of wild, windswept fens and bogs.
Wild and pathless land: Travellers shun this trackless
and treacherous region. It is home only to marsh lanterns,

Castle Brackenwold (Hex 1508)
Population: 8,700.
Ancient fortress town: A great, walled town sits sprawled
upon the hillside at the feet of the fortified castle and keep.
Castle Brackenwold is an ancient place whose oldest parts
were used by elf lords in ancient times, before the people
of Brackenwold migrated to Dolmenwood.
Seat of the duke and the Pluritine Church: At the summit
of a hill, the ducal keep is the ancestral home to the nobility
of the Brackenwold line. Alongside the mighty garrison
maintained by the duke is a great cathedral, making this
fortress-town also the centre of the Church’s power in the
region. Indeed, the Bishop of Brackenwold holds sway over
Dolmenwood equal to the duke himself.

The Valley of Wise
Beasts

Home of the Cobbins: In the northern central region of the
forest, this long valley, though uninhabited by humans, is
home to many a sentient soul. The quaint, wooden homes
of the talking, humanoid beasts who call themselves
Cobbins sit beside the placid River Shiver that winds at
the Valley’s base.
Baron Fragglehorn’s regime of terror: To an outsider, the
Valley gives a surface impression of tranquil, well-ordered
society, where all Cobbins live as equals and hunger and
evil are but rumours. In truth, however, the inhabitants
of the Valley live in a regime of terror as subjects of the
Nag-Lord, under the totalitarian rule of the crookhorn
Baron Fragglehorn (p46).

The Nag-Lord as lord of creation: The command of the
Baron is so absolute that Cobbins of the Valley have no
conception of the world beyond, believing the Nag-Lord
to be lord of all of creation.

Cobton-on-the-Shiver (Hex 1104)
Population: 200 Cobbins.
Largest Cobbin town: This settlement of respectable stone
houses, straw-built nests, and looming barracks is the
centre of Cobbin civilisation in the Valley.
Built on top of human ruins: Cobton-on-the-Shiver was
founded on the ruins of a human-built hamlet, long abandoned. The beasts of the Valley were tasked with clearing
the stone remnants from the undergrowth and restoring
the place to domestic function.

History
A brief telling of the deeds of godlings, fairies, and mortals in Dolmenwood
since the beginning of days.
Overview
Beginning of days: Dolmenwood untrod by sentient
life; the spirit of the Wood manifested in the form of
primeval beings called the Wood Gods; the dragon
Gheillough was the lifeblood of the waters.

The Beginning of Days
Primeval Sentience of the Wood

L

2,000 years ago: The Cold Prince withdraws into Frigia;
fairy frost melts.

ike all natural places of significance, the trees,
waters, stones, and earth of Dolmenwood are host
to a native consciousness which operates on a
scale far beyond the comprehension of the mortal mind.
This consciousness manifested in the form of primeval
spirits, known collectively as the Wood Gods. In the primeval days of yore, when Dolmenwood was freshly sprung
from the designs of the divine, it was these manifestations
of Dolmenwood itself that first beheld the Wood. See Wood
Gods, p36 for more details.

1,900 years ago: Arrival of the Drune; Drune Lodge
established.

Gheillough—Lifeblood of the Waters

Prehistory: Fairies venture into Dolmenwood; the
dominion of the Cold Prince; Dolmenwood cloaked in
eternal winter.
2,500 years ago: Arrival of mortals; breggles serve the
Cold Prince; trade with humans.

1,800 years ago: Early human settlements; first witches.
1,700 years ago: Drune bind Gheillough, call up ley
stones; breggles serve the Drune.
1,500 years ago: Breggles betray the Drune; theft and
destruction of the Horned Crown of the Hydrogyle.
1,200 years ago: Brackenwolders arrive; Pluritine
Church begins to replace Gwyrae worship.

Of especial importance to the history of Dolmenwood
is the Wood God known as Gheillough—a being of dragon-like aspect whose dominion is the waters of Dolmenwood, in particular the great Lake Longmere. Gheillough’s
function, via the waters of Dolmenwood, was to regulate
the arcane energies of the forest.

Current Year 1089
The founding of Castle Brackenwold and the Kingdom
of Brackenwold, 1,089 years ago, marks the beginning of
the Brackenwold Calendar used in Dolmenwood (DPB).

14

In ancient times, long before the dominion of mortal folk
had spread wide across the earth, beings from the timeless
realm of Fairy found their way into the dew-fresh glades of
Dolmenwood. Elves and others of fairy kin were thus the
first outsiders to lay eyes upon the Wood.

The Wood Gods Veiled
Sensing the arrogance and capriciousness of the fairies,
the Wood Gods hid themselves from the interlopers and
observed their doings with dispassion.

Establishment of Fairy Kingdoms
Some fairies tarried in Dolmenwood for but a short while
before returning to their own realm. Others, acquiring a
taste for the odd tapestry of arcane energies in the forest,
established outposts, dwellings, manses, and castles there.
These early settlers became known as lords of the forest,
long before the first human set foot beneath its eaves. Some
eventually abandoned their domains in Dolmenwood and
returned to Fairy, but many retained their presence in the
forest, even after the arrival of mortal folk. It is thus that
the foundations of culture in Dolmenwood are ultimately
of fairy origin.

Part One | Secr ets of Dolmenwood

2,000 years ago
The Cold Prince Withdraws
This period is considered the beginning of known history
in Dolmenwood, commencing with the gradual withdrawal of the Cold Prince into his dominion in Fairy, Frigia.
The Prince remained the nominal ruler of Dolmenwood,
but left its governance to his courtiers and underlings.

Nature Takes Hold—The Frost Recedes
With the Prince’s attentions elsewhere, time and the natural processes of the mortal world took hold once more and
the cycle of the seasons returned to Dolmenwood. The
fairy frost began to recede. In its place, lush mosses and
vegetation sprang up, fed by the enchanted meltwaters,
which pooled to form fens and swamps.

Only Dwelmfurgh Remains Frozen
Only Dwelmfurgh, where the Prince’s castle was located,
on the verge of Lake Longmere, remained frozen.

1,900 years ago
The Arrival of the Drune

Dominion of the Cold Prince

A

s the years slipped by and the whims of fairy lords
waxed and waned, Dolmenwood came under
the sway of a cruel elf lord known as the Cold
Prince. All other fairy lords who maintained an interest
in the Wood were subservient to his will, who claimed the
entirety of Dolmenwood as an extension of his domain
in Fairy.

Eternal Winter
By the whim of the Cold Prince, Dolmenwood was cloaked
in frost and snow, locked in an eternal winter. All waters
were frozen solid, save Lake Longmere, which remained
untouched by the frost due to the presence of the dragon
Gheillough. Fairies, unicorns, and magical beasts frolicked
beneath the rime-frosted boughs of the Wood, but few of
mortal kin dared trespass in the Prince’s dread dominion.

The commerce between humans and the fairy dominion
in Dolmenwood had attracted cunning folk—the occult
cabal known as the Drune. These were the first humans to
venture into the forest and build dwellings after the receding of the frost. To establish their presence in Dolmenwood, the early Drune settlers founded the Drune Lodge
in the depths of Dwelmfurgh (hex 0507).

The Origins of Ley-Magic
The Drune discovered a powerful confluence of ley lines
in Dolmenwood, which they learned to harness to their
own ends. This was the beginning of the Drune’s greedy
accumulation of occult power in Dolmenwood.

The Drune and the Wood Gods
In their wanderings through the hidden places of Dolmenwood, the Drune came into contact with the Wood Gods.
As is their way when encountering magic of any kind, the
Drune lusted after the power of the Wood Gods and experimented with means of binding and ensnaring them.

Breggles Serve the Cold Prince

Early Woodcutters and Hunters

The first mortals to arrive in Dolmenwood were breggles,
who prostrated themselves before the Cold Prince and
were accepted into his courts and castles as servitors.

Humans Trade with the Fairy Kingdom
Although no humans settled within Dolmenwood at this
time, certain bold folk from neighbouring lands would
traffic with the Prince’s people, bringing them various
oddments in exchange for fairy trinkets and knowledge.

A small number of other humans—not affiliated with the
Drune, though some of the same cultural origins—settled
in Dolmenwood during this era, founding hamlets under
the eaves of the forest, eking out a living as woodcutters
and hunters.

The Wood Gods Venerated
These early settlers encountered and venerated the Wood
Gods, establishing the Gwyrae religion and the traditions
and practices of witchcraft in Dolmenwood.

Gheillough Bound

The Arrival of the Brackenwolders

t the heart of the wood, in the frost-clad fairy
woods of Dwelmfurgh, the Drune discovered an
ancient magical potency in the flashing waters
of the great Lake Longmere—the Wood God Gheillough.
The sorcerers bent their will upon harnessing the mystic
powers of the dragon, eventually succeeding in binding it.
With this godling beneath their yoke, the Drune’s capacity
to mould the forest to their will increased manifold.

A second, more organised wave of human settlers entered
Dolmenwood from the south-east, bringing with them
their rigid, monotheistic religion—the Pluritine Church.
They rapidly inhabited the south-eastern reaches of
Dolmenwood and appropriated the small number of
extant settlements as their own, coercing the natives to
convert (if, initially, in appearance only) to their faith.

A

The Workings of the Drune
In this intermediate era, the Drune achieved the peak of
their arcane potency. Their chiefs rivalled the fairy lords in
wizardly might, and they worked great magic in Dolmenwood, re-routing and amplifying the ley energies, and
calling up many of the ley stones from the earth.

Breggles Serve the Drune
As the influence of the Cold Prince and his court waned,
the breggles who had served the fairy aristocracy swore
fealty to the Drune in their stead, worshipping them as
men-made-gods.

1,500 years ago
The Betrayal of the Breggles
The Drune’s lordship over the breggles was short lived,
however, due to the deeds of a breggle woman named
Hraigl. Hraigl was favoured by the Drune and was granted
high rank within the hierarchy of their servants, including access to their secret libraries and sacred relics. The
Drune’s trust was misplaced: Hraigl became enamoured
of the most potent of all Drune-relics—the Horned Crown
of the Hydrogyle—and stole the artefact, using its powers
to disappear into the twisting pathways of the ley lines.

Drune and Breggles War
Using the power of the Horned Crown, Hraigl turned her
folk against the Drune, drawing them to her side and establishing the breggle-dominion of the High Wold. The Drune
fought this betrayal fiercely, finally cornering Hraigl at the
craggy summit of Wight Falls (0607). Knowing her doom
was at hand, Hraigl cast herself into the torrent. She was
thus killed and the Crown shattered and ground to dust.
The Drune cursed the kin of Hraigl for ninety-nine generations, and to this day harbour a mistrust of all breggles.

Origins of the Longhorn Nobility
The longhorn nobility, for their part, trace the heritage of
their noble houses back to the seven kids borne by Hraigl
before her demise.

16

The Drune Withdraw
Faced with aggressive settlers and eschewing mundane
power, the Drune withdrew to the secrecy of the deep
woods, becoming ever more obscure.

1,100 years ago
The Kingdom of Brackenwold Founded
The invaders established the Kingdom of Brackenwold,
encompassing, in the absence of the Cold Prince, the whole
of Dolmenwood outside of the frozen Dwelmfurgh.

The Building of Castles and Shrines
Castle Brackenwold was founded on the ruined remnants
of an ancient fairy keep, and a profusion of shrines and
churches glorifying the God of the Pluritine Church were
constructed in and around the forest at this time.

1,000 years ago
Breggles and Humans Rule the High Wold
The people of Brackenwold spread wide throughout
Dolmenwood and came to build villages and farms in
the breggle-ruled regions of the High Wold. It was in this
period that the tradition, peculiar to the High Wold, of
longhorn and human aristocrats ruling side by side originated.

900 years ago
The Cold Prince’s Wrath
The Cold Prince’s fickle mind turned once more to Dolmenwood, which he still regarded as his own property. Asserting his claim to Dolmenwood above that of the King of
Brackenwold, the Cold Prince caused a fey winter to fall on
the forest. Many mortal folk died in the fairy winter, and
territorial dispute soon escalated to war.

Fairies and Mortals War
The fairy armies of the Cold Prince marched forth from
Frigia and were met by the armies of the King upon the
battlefield of the High Wold. The armies of mortals suffered
great losses in this first battle.

Triple Compact Banishes the Cold Prince

F

ollowing two years of all-out war, the King and the
Church made a desperate and unlikely alliance
with the power-hungry Drune. This alliance—
known as the “Triple Compact”—colluded to divert the
energy of the ley line Ywyr into a great ring encircling
Dwelmfurgh, where the gates to the fey kingdom of Frigia
lay. A mighty ward was erected, banishing the Cold Prince
from Dolmenwood, forcing him into exile in Frigia, and at
last freeing the central woods from their ages-old mantle
of frost.

Saint Clewyd and the Atacorn
The living saint Clewyd journeyed to Dolmenwood, following the trail of the wicked Atacorn Sallowbryg, who took
the form of a scarlet unicorn. Clewyd pursued the beast
into the depths of the forest, where the two battled and
struck deadly blows upon one another. With his dying
breath, the saint swore to pursue the monster’s soul to hell
and vanquish it there.

The Saint Slain
St Clewyd’s followers discovered his slain body alongside that of the Atacorn several days later and vowed to
construct a great abbey at the site, in honour of the saint.

600 years ago

300 years ago

Political Alliances

The Abbey of St Clewyd Founded

The Kingdom of Brackenwold was amalgamated into a
wider kingdom, becoming a duchy. At this time, the High
Wold became a barony under the rule of the Duke of Brackenwold.

400 years ago
Atanuwë Arrives in Secret
A wandering Chaos godling—known to the learned as
Atanuwë Nine-Legs—chanced upon the fecund realm of
Dolmenwood and took a liking to the place.

Sargstone Wrested from the Drune
Atanuwë was drawn to the weird energies of the nodal Sargstone (hex 0904). The beast confronted and vanquished
the guardian Audrune (Hemlack) and established a secret
court around Sargstone, claiming the nodal for its own.

Cults and Spawn of Chaos
Atanuwë enslaved and magically corrupted the rustic breggles of northern Dolmenwood, creating the wicked crookhorns as worshippers and servants. In unholy union with a
sect of corrupted human women, Atanuwë’s children—the
accursed Atacorns—were spawned.

Gheillough Corrupted
The presence of Atanuwë slowly corrupted the waters of
Lake Longmere, breaking the dragon Gheillough free from
the bondage of the Drune and causing the manifestation
of its twisted dream-double—the monstrosity known
to locals as Big Chook. With the loss of their most potent
source of arcane energy, the Drune’s power was lessened.

350 years ago
Rumours of the Nag-Lord

A capstone for the Church and its conquest of Dolmenwood, the Abbey of St Clewyd was completed at the site of
the saint’s death, in the heart of the wood (see hex 0906).

100 years ago
The Ruination of the Abbey
The abbot of St Clewyd’s, an arrogant and ambitious man
named Lummingwyll, delved into forbidden texts in an
attempt to commune with the spirit of St Clewyd. A magical disaster resulted, ripping open a dimensional rift in
the abbey’s crypts. An explosion of chaotic energies and
monstrous beings was released, including a monstrous
man/unicorn hybrid—the amalgam of Clewyd and Sallowbryg. The abbey was destroyed and has lain abandoned,
in ruins, ever since. The Chaos Rift still rages, although its
effects on the surface have recently subsided. The abbey’s
downfall marks the beginning of the decline of the Church
in Dolmenwood.

The Rise of Atanuwë, Shrines Lost
No longer content to lurk in the obscure north of the forest,
Atanuwë harnessed the weird energies of the Sargstone
to send a corrupting arcane miasma oozing into Dolmenwood’s waters and soil. Many of the shrines erected by the
Pluritine Church in the deep places of the Wood were lost,
being hidden, veiled, warped, or displaced by the corrupting influence of Atanuwë.

Present Day
Crookhorns Massing for War
Atanuwë’s minions roam ever more boldly abroad, venturing into Aldweald and the heartland of civilisation. With
the Pluritine Church weakened and its own forces waxing,
Atanuwë is poised for all-out warfare, seeking dominion
of all Dolmenwood.

Wanderers in the wild northern woods encountered the
court and minions of Atanuwë. The few who escaped with
their lives whispered of this evil presence, and the wicked
Nag-Lord entered folklore.

Ley Lines
and Standing Stones
The earth magic of Dolmenwood, long cultivated by the learned.

A

s its name conveys, the Wood of Dolmens is a
place brimming with monoliths, obelisks, and
stone circles, erected by its inhabitants since the
long forgotten past. Wandering in the woods, adventurers
are bound to stumble across these stones and wonder at
their origin and secrets, for even to the simple, rustic folk
of the Wood, it is clear that the stones of Dolmenwood have
some occult significance.

Lamm—The Line of Woe
Inscribes a directly north-south line through central
Dolmenwood, passing through the Court of the Nag-Lord
(0904) and the foetid wastes of Hag’s Addle. Two of the four
nodals on Lamm have been corrupted by Atanuwë.
Arcane scent: The sensation of being observed by a pitiless
malevolence.

Certain stones, known as nodals, are indeed of great significance: marking, in the physical world, the lines of otherworldly energy that run through the Wood—the ley lines.

Spell enhancement: The range of arcane spells of divination or detection is increased by 50%.

Ley Lines

Runs from the south-western corner of the Wood, within
a mile of Nodding Castle, through the northernmost
reaches of Hag’s Addle, beneath Chateau Mauvesse (home
of Ygraine the sorceress), and to the desolate Table Downs
in the north-east.

Ley lines, said to exist throughout the world, are paths
of arcane earth energy that sustain the life of the land.
Dolmenwood is located at a nexus of great potency: the
crossing of three major ley lines. This arcane confluence
heightens the occult significance and weird atmosphere of
the Wood. Additionally, a fourth, artificial ley exists, curled
within the western reach of the forest.

Magical Effects of Ley Lines
Even to those not versed in the secrets of geomantic magic,
ley lines have two noticeable effects:
Arcane scent: Arcane spell-casters perceive a supernatural
sensation in hexes which a ley line passes through.
Spell enhancement: Spells of a certain type are enhanced
when cast in hexes which a ley line passes through.

Chell—The Witching Ring
Inscribes a circle around Lake Longmere, in the far west of
the Wood. Chell is described in detail overleaf.
Arcane scent: The curious dual sensation of balmy heat
and biting cold.
Spell enhancement: Arcane spells of fire, cold, or lightning
inflict one additional point of damage per damage die.

Hoad—The Line of Birthing
Runs from the north-western corner of Dolmenwood,
where the woods overwhelm the fens of the Northern
Scratch, through the Groaning Loch, and to the south-east
of the Wood close to Castle Brackenwold.
Arcane scent: The feeling of having just awoken from a
dream.
Spell enhancement: Saving Throws versus arcane spells
of illusion or phantasm are made at a –2 penalty.

18

Ywyr—The Line of Ravens

Arcane scent: The distant moaning of the dead.
Spell enhancement: Saving Throws versus arcane spells
dealing with death or undeath are made at a –2 penalty.

Nodal Stones

The most potent standing stones in Dolmenwood are
known as nodal stones, each erected at a nexus point of
arcane power along the course of a major ley line. Presently, the great majority of the nodals are under the
control of the Drune, with a member of their sect posted
as a permanent guardian in the vicinity. The Nodal Stones
table gives a summary of the nodals, including the name
of each stone’s guardian. Other unique properties of each
nodal are described in the appropriate hex description (see
Part Six: Hex Descriptions, p187).
Inscribed spells: Most nodal stones are inscribed with
Drunic runes for an arcane spell. An arcane spell-caster can
transcribe the runes for future study (treated as studying
a spell book—see Arcane Magic, DPB). Transcribing a spell
takes 1 hour per Rank.

Lesser Stones

While the nodal stones represent the geomantic crown
jewels of Dolmenwood, they are not the only stones of
magical significance in the Wood. The numerous lesser
stones are not coveted like the nodals, but they are not
without power. Many a glade lies under an old enchantment centred on a long-disused standing stone. The location and powers of the most important of the lesser stones
are noted in the appropriate hex description (see Part Six:
Hex Descriptions, p187).

In addition to the four ley lines proper within Dolmenwood, those who are learned in the arts of geomancy have
noted the emergence of what may be a fifth ley, tracing an
east-west path through the Wood. This enigmatic protoley has—as yet—no arcane scent and no known magical
properties; its existence is hypothesised only due to the
presence of four spectral stones that appear in specific

locations (hexes 0106, 0306, 1306, 1706) under certain
conditions. These stones are known collectively as vorpal
monoliths.
The origin, development, and possible powers of this fifth
ley line and its spectral nodal stones is a topic of great interest to those who concern themselves with the geomantic
energies of Dolmenwood (i.e. primarily the Drune).

The Ring of Chell
The mighty warding effects and vulnerabilities of the artificial ley line Chell.

C

hell is an artificial ley line brought into being
some 850 years ago by an unlikely alliance known
as the Triple Compact—the Drune, the Church,
and the King of Brackenwold. The purpose of Chell is the
banishment of the Cold Prince and his frost elf armies from
Dolmenwood forevermore (see History, p14).

The Creation of Chell

The energy of Ywyr was tapped at its southernmost
nodal—the circle of obelisks called the Pelloryons. From
this foundation point, Ywyr’s energy was siphoned into
a ring of arcane power. Five great stones were called from
the earth at points around the ring, tethering it. A final,
central stone was summoned and, with a great ritual, the
ring was made permanent. These six summoned stones
are known as the Summerstones.

The Effects of the Ward

Chell forms a mighty ward that to this day keeps the gates
to the fairy kingdom of Frigia locked shut, barring the Cold
Prince and his armies from returning to Dolmenwood. The
ban has the following side-effects within the Ring of Chell:
The ban: Frost elves cannot enter Dwelmfurgh. It is even
impossible to physically drag a frost elf across the border.
Inaccessible from Fairy: No doors to or from Fairy exist
within Chell, and no fairy roads cross through the ring.
Fairy malaise: True fairies, excluding demi-fey, are
afflicted by a malaise of the spirit, perceiving the shadow
of death hanging heavy over all things.
Teleportation nullified: Magical teleportation (including
magic that summons creatures or objects from a distant
location) is utterly ineffectual.
Reality prevails: Magic of illusion or charm is weak and
hazy, with a 2-in-6 chance of failure.
Drune magic: As masters of Dwelmfurgh and the Ring of
Chell, Drune magic is unaffected by the limitations listed
above. They are able to use teleportation within the ring,
and Drune magic of charm and illusion has no chance of
failure.

The Warding Stones

Chell is tethered and maintained by a set of seven nodals—
six forming the ring and a seventh at its centre.

The Pelloryons
The first and most crucial nodal on Chell is the Pelloryons
(also known as the “Three Sisters”), the point at which the
energy of Ywyr is siphoned into the warding ring.
Appearance: The Pelloryons consists of three towering
pillars, each constructed of a single cyclopean column
of chalky limestone, approximately 10′ around and 18′ in
height, and carved into the likeness of different characters.

The Summerstones
The other six warding stones are the Summerstones.
Placement: The Summerstones are positioned at locations where, in ancient times, access to the fairy kingdom
of Frigia was possible. No sign remains of the fairy gates
which once stood at these locations.
Appearance: Physically, the Summerstones are all alike:
massive shards of basalt (a black, volcanic rock), warm to
the touch, approximately 8′ in diameter and 15′ high. Each
is inscribed with a text in Old Woldish runes (see below).
Frost ward: Within 120 yards of a Summerstone, a hazy
warmth and balmy stillness of the forest air pervades,
reminiscent of the intoxicating days of high summer.
These glades are never touched by frost or snow, even in
deepest winter.

The Runic Inscription
This stone stands by decree
Of the Triple Compact of Tolmenwode:
King Hadryg of Brackenwold,
The High Abbot of Wellskeep,
The Elder Phanatarch of the Wood.
Hereby knows fire dominion over frost.
The gates of Frigia be shut.
The Lord of Winter may pass no more.

Breaking the Ward

The magic that maintains Chell is of a magnitude that
modern magicians cannot equal. It is not, however,
completely impervious to attack. Two main possibilities
for breaking or suspending the ward exist: tampering with
the Summerstones or disturbing the Pelloryons, the source
of the ley energy.

Disturbing the Summerstones
The Summerstones are impervious to mundane damage
and magical energy attacks (including disintegration).
They could, however, be destroyed by powerful relics or
specially constructed magic items. Were the warding about
one or more stones to be broken or suspended, the following events would transpire.
One stone disturbed: An invisible doorway opens beside
the stone, allowing entrance to Dolmenwood from the
fairy Kingdom of Frigia. Frost elf spies emerge and race
through the wood, carrying fey jewels and ice gems to
tempt mortals to their cause. Their goals are to contact the
Prince’s embassy behind the Falls of Naon (hex 0504) and
to locate and destroy the remaining warding stones. They
know of the weak-point at the Pelloryons and may choose
to focus their attack on that site.
Two stones disturbed: A freezing wind wracks the forest.
In spring or summer, the trees drop their leaves in a premature autumn. Frost elf knights and their icy steeds march
into the forest. They carry blasting horns that can shatter

stone, and seek out the remaining warding stones, bent on
reducing them to rubble.
Three stones disturbed: The armies of the Cold Prince are
unleashed onto Dolmenwood, accompanied by deep snow
over the whole wood. All waters freeze.
Four or more stones disturbed: Chell is utterly destroyed.
The earth shudders as the energy of Ywyr violently returns
to its natural course. The ban is completely broken and the
fairy gates to Frigia are reopened. The Cold Prince may
return to the mortal world. His wrath brings a fey winter
upon Dolmenwood for all eternity.

Disturbing the Pelloryons
As the foundation point from which the energy of Ywyr is
siphoned into Chell, the Pelloryons are the most vulnerable node of the warding ring. Naturally, this means that
they are also the most vigilantly guarded.
Befuddling illusions: The Pelloryons are concealed at the
centre of a maze of glamours and illusion (see hex 0509).
Guardian Audrune: The Pelloryons are under the constant
watch of the Audrune Cadraigaunt, who will protect the
stones with his life, should any come with malice in mind.
Toppling the Three Sisters: If the illusions and guardians are overcome, the Pelloryons may be toppled with
mundane might. This causes the instant and final destruction of Chell and its warding enchantment. (This has the
same effects as disturbing four Summerstones, see Four
or More Stones Disturbed.)

Shrines
Places of spiritual respite for devout adventurers, many now lost in the wilds.

A

multitude of wayside shrines once dotted the
tracks of Dolmenwood, a balm to the way-weary
and a monument to the Church’s power over the
wild woods. Time and the pernicious influence of Atanuwë,
however, have caused many of the shrines to become lost.

History of the Shrines

Upon arriving in Dolmenwood (see History, p14), the
Pluritine Church set about making its mark on the landscape and in the minds of the local folk. A profusion of
shrines, chapels, and churches sprang up in towns and
villages and along roadsides.

A Shrine in Every Village
At the peak of the Church’s power, a shrine to all thirty-four major saints existed within Dolmenwood, as well
as shrines to many saints of lesser importance. For centuries, these were places of pilgrimage and spiritual respite
to travellers in the wild woods.

Corruption by Atanuwë
With the waxing power of the Nag-Lord, the woodland
paths of Dolmenwood grew once more wild, Atanuwë’s
corrupting influence pushing back against the forces of
order and civilisation. A century ago, the wayside shrines
began to disappear, veiled or displaced by Atanuwë’s capricious magic. Outside of towns and villages, the majority
of the old wayside shrines are now lost. Many have been
overwhelmed by the wild growth of plants and fungi, the
pilgrims’ paths that once led to them absorbed into undergrowth. Others have been concealed or moved entirely,
under the influence of more pernicious energies.

Locating Shrines

The locations of all shrines in Dolmenwood are denoted in
the Shrines of Dolmenwood table.
Active shrines: Shrines highlighted in bold are in active
use. Their locations are well known to the Church.
Lost shrines: Other shrines are lost. Adventurers may
locate lost shrines by travelling to the appropriate hex, but
their locations are not known to the Church. The Referee
may wish to send PCs on quests to locate a specific lost
shrine. In this case, they may have advice from a Church
official on the supposed whereabouts of the shrine (e.g.
from old maps). It is recommended that such information be inaccurate, leading PCs to roughly the right part of
Dolmenwood, but not to the exact hex where the shrine
is located.

22

Praying at Shrines

Holy spell-casters who pray for 1 hour at a shrine may
receive the blessing of the saint in the form of a specific
holy spell.
One use: The spell bestowed by a saint’s blessing is added
to the character’s list of memorised spells. Once cast, it is
gone and the saint’s blessing expires.
One blessing at a time: A character may only have the
blessing of a single saint (and therefore only a single additional spell) at any one time. Praying at a shrine dedicated
to a different saint causes the spell bestowed by the new
saint to replace that bestowed by the previous saint.
Spells of higher Rank: A spell bestowed by a saint’s blessing may be of higher Rank than the character is usually
able to memorise. For example, a Level 2 cleric (normally
able to memorise only Rank 1 spells) is able to memorise
and cast a single spell of Rank 2 or higher after praying at a
shrine. Or, for example, a Level 1 cleric (not normally able
to memorise spells at all) is able to memorise and cast a
single spell after praying at a shrine.
Repeated blessings: Characters may wish to return to a
previously visited shrine and pray again. The saint’s blessing is bestowed once more only if the spell is of a Rank that
the character can normally memorise and as long as at
least one day has passed.

Non-Spell-Casters (Optional Rule)
The Referee may also allow adventurers of other Classes
(i.e. not holy spell-casters) to pray at shrines and receive
the blessing of the saints.
Requirements: The character must be of Lawful Alignment, Level 3 or higher, and have performed worthy deeds
in the service of the Church.
Once ever: The character can only receive the blessing of
each saint once ever.

Restoring Shrines

Some lost or abandoned shrines are in a rather poor state
of repair. Before characters can gain the benefits of prayer
at such shrines, they must repair or restore the shrine to a
decent condition. The details of this are noted in the hex
descriptions of lost or abandoned shrines.

Fairy
The nature of the timeless realm and how one may get there from Dolmenwood.

T

he native realm of fairies is adjacent to the mortal
world, but veiled from those of mortal birth. In
Dolmenwood, the boundary between the two
realms grows thin, such that the laughter of fairies may at
times be heard drifting on the winds of the fields we know.
An exhaustive account of the Undying Realm is beyond
the scope of this book—only the most pertinent details
on Fairy and its peoples as they relate to Dolmenwood are
discussed here.

The Nature of Fairy
Permeated With Magic

Fairy Dominions in
Dolmenwood

Of old, all Dolmenwood was ruled by fairy nobles, who
claimed sections of the forest as extensions of their
domains in Fairy. Those days are long since past, and
the Wood as a whole is now ruled by mortals. However,
remnants of fairy rule abide to this day in certain corners
of Dolmenwood, and a small number of fairy nobles retain
a dominion in the mortal world. These are discussed under
Fairy Nobles and Their Dominions, p30.

FAIRY DOORS

Fairy is endless and timeless, beyond the comprehension
of mortals. The very nature of Fairy is steeped with magic,
so much so that, to natives of that realm, magic is entirely
natural and unremarkable.

Doors into Fairy exist in a few special places in Dolmenwood, though some are hidden and others are guarded.
The Fairy Doors table lists these portals. Individual doors
are detailed in the descriptions of the hexes where they
are located.

Time Flows Unevenly

Doors directly into Fairy: A few fairy doors lead directly
into the domain of a particular fairy noble. Such doors are
impassable without a special invitation from the noble.

The forces of time, ageing, and decay do not wrack Fairy
in the same way as they do the mortal world. While events
come to pass one after the other, decay and death are not
inevitable facts of life and time does not flow in an even
course, but twists and loops and lurches.
Those few bold or hapless mortals who journey for long
periods in Fairy often find that, upon returning to their
own world, only a few days have passed. Conversely, one
who makes a brief dalliance in Fairy may find that years
have passed upon their return to the mortal world.

Doors into fairy roads: Other fairy doors lead into one of
the fairy roads that crisscross Dolmenwood. These magical
roads allow rapid travel from one part of Dolmenwood
to another, via isolated regions of Fairy. See Fairy Roads,
p26 for full details on travelling along fairy roads.

A Multitude of Regions
Fairy is divided into innumerable regions, each with
its own character and denizens. Some regions are lush
and fecund, filled with flitting, mirthful sprites; others
are sombre and forbidding, ruled by mighty Kings and
Queens; still others are wild and untamed, abandoned save
for flowers of deathly beauty.
The most important regions and personages of Fairy are
described under Fairy Nobles and Their Dominions, p30.

Fairies of Myriad Kinds
The inhabitants of Fairy are endless in their variety. Many
fairies are of a particular folk—elves, goblins, sprites,
satyrs, hobs, pooks, redcaps, and bogeys, to name but a
small number—each having their homeland in a particular region of Fairy. Other fairies are unique individuals,
sprung into existence without parent or kin.

24

Journeys Into Fairy (Optional)
While adventurers may journey along Dolmenwood’s
fairy roads, Fairy itself is inaccessible, with all entrances
requiring an invitation from a fairy noble. The game is
set up in this way to simplify the Referee’s job by avoiding unprepared jaunts into another world that is only
lightly detailed in this book.
Referees wishing to expand play into one or more
specific regions of Fairy may provide PCs with an invitation or other means of entering Fairy. This requires
the Referee to develop adventure locales of their own
in the desired region of Fairy.

Fairy Roads
Pathways constructed by mighty fairies of old, some of which still function.

I

n ancient days, when all of Dolmenwood was
ruled from Fairy, the mighty lords and ladies of
the Wood set about constructing a web of magical roads that enabled travel from one place in the mortal
world to another via the twisting ways of Fairy. Six of these
ancient fairy roads remain in Dolmenwood and may be
used by those of adventurous spirit. The use of fairy roads
is not without peril.

Entering a Fairy Road

Fairy roads are accessed by magical doors in the mortal
world, one located at each end of the road. Some of these
doors are plain to see, while others are magically warded or
veiled. Doors are detailed in the descriptions of the hexes
where they are located.

Where Fairy Roads Lead

While fairy roads conceptually lead directly from one location in Dolmenwood to another, in reality they twist and
meander through the border regions of Fairy, such that
travellers do not experience them as a straight course.

Journeys Along Fairy
Roads

When entering a fairy road, one leaves the comfortable
surety of the mortal world and ventures into Fairy, where
magic permeates all things. Journeys along a fairy road are
thus perilous and unpredictable.

Travel Procedure
Use the standard rules for overland travel (see Travel, DPB).
Each fairy road has a defined length in miles.
Getting lost: As characters are following a road, there is no
chance of them getting lost.
Encounters and locations: As characters travel along a
fairy road they may encounter monsters or special locations. Roll 1d6 up to three times per day (or part of a day) of
travel on a fairy road. If the roll comes up 1–2, a monster is
encountered (roll 1d20 on the Fairy Road Encounters table).
If the roll comes up 3–4, a location is encountered (roll 1d8
on the Locations table for the road being traversed—note
that the same location may be encountered twice!).

26

Don’t Stray From the Path
Fairy roads, though they may appear to pass through wide
expanses of terrain, are in fact only partially real, existing
in magically isolated regions of Fairy. Characters who stray
from a fairy road soon begin to feel faint. Those who persist
lose consciousness within 1 Turn, awakening some time
later in a random hex in Dolmenwood. Roll 2d6 on the Time
Passed in the Mortal World table to see how much time has
passed in the mortal world.

Side-Roads
Fairy roads are not only useful as a means of travel between
distant locations in the mortal world, but also lead into
Fairy via side-roads to the domains of specific fairy nobles.
Invitation only: Side-roads are impassable without a
special invitation from a fairy noble (see Journeys Into
Fairy, p24). They lead the uninvited off the fairy road
(see Don’t Stray From the Path).

Journey’s End
Time in Fairy does not flow in the same manner as it does
in the mortal world. The perceptual time elapsed during a
party’s journey along a fairy road bears no relation to the
passing of time in the mortal world.
Time in the mortal world: When the party returns to the
mortal world, roll 2d6 on the Time Passed in the Mortal
World table to see how much time has elapsed.

A broad, flagstoned road branches off. An ivy-crowned

a large stone. The side-road leads to Diuthurnia (p30).
The road passes along a rocky ledge. At the bottom of the
50′ drop can be spied a second road which soon diverges.
This is a side-road to Ravenwild (p34).
The road ascends a boulder-strewn hillside in a series of
gravelly switchbacks. There is a 3-in-6 chance of a landslide: Save Versus Hold or suffer 1d8 damage.
The road crosses a stone bridge flanked by unicorn statues. Gazing into the misty river below, one may glimpse
the goings-on in Castle Brackenwold.
Night falls, bringing utter darkness for 6 hours. During
this time, 2d4 shadows (DMB) emerge from the trees,
grasping after living souls.
The forest recedes and the road passes through a misty
heath. 1d6 blessed unicorns (DMB) are grazing on the
rough grass.
A hunting lodge, copiously adorned with antlers,
stands beside the road, windows shuttered. The door
is not locked. Inside are five lightly furnished rooms,
cobwebbed and dusty, but serviceable. Any who sleep
here regain 1d6 HP and awake with greying hair.
The ravens’ cries intensify to a maddening din. PCs with
Wisdom 6 or less must Save Versus Spell or run into the
woods, leaving the road.

The Prince’s Road

A relentlessly straight road, paved with slabs of cut ice. The
Prince’s Road passes through a frozen wasteland wracked
by howling wind and snowstorms.
Cut short: The Prince’s Road originally ran to the gates of
Hoarblight Keep (hex 0505), but its path is now blocked
by the ley line Chell (see p20). Thus only a single door
grants entry to this road. Travellers who reach the end of
the road are dumped without warning into hex 0806, close
to the wall of white flame.
Doors: The hoary gate (1308).
Length: 24 miles.

A lopsided, 4′-high door in the canyon wall hangs open,

A green-varnished door in the canyon wall, with a shiny
brass door-knocker, clasped in the mouth of a jester.
Behind the door is a side-road leading into the steaming
tropical gardens of the Gladding-Gloam (p34).

The canyon splits into a winding maze of rocky paths,
increasing the effective length of the road by 4d6 miles
(reduced by 2 miles for each PC with Intelligence 15+).
A twinkling star emerges in the sky, gradually waxes,
and plunges comet-like into the canyon ahead. Impish
faces dance amid the flames of the star-ember. They
offer the PC with the highest Charisma a wish in
exchange for their soul. (The PC can never be raised
from the dead.)
2d4 goblins (DMB) peddle their wares from candlelit
niches in the canyon walls.
The road descends a steep stairway, entering a chthonic
region of pitch darkness extending for 1 mile.
2d6 skeletons burst from the canyon walls, clawing after
living flesh.
The influence of the ley line Chell disrupts the road.
Space fractures and the party tumbles into a void,
emerging in the mortal world in hex 0807.

The road crosses a frozen river that heads toward a misty
pine-wood in the distance. The river is a side-road to
Ravenwild (p34).
Icy statues of elf nobles line the road. They whisper to
passersby in High Elfish: “Pay fealty to the Prince.”
A pair of 16′ tall, ice-carved knights flank the road.
Speaking in distant whispers, they demand a toll of
100gp per mortal who wishes to pass. If denied their
price, they attack. (Treat as wicker giants—DMB—with

A raging blizzard descends, rapidly burying the road
under snowdrifts. There is a 3-in-6 chance of PCs becoming lost and wandering off the road.
A frozen human is entombed beneath the surface of the
road. If dug up they thaw out within a day. They angered
the Cold Prince in ages long past with a petty deed and
still fear his wrath. They speak Old Woldish.
A homely inn—the Hobbler’s Rest—stands beside the
road. It is run by a cantankerous old goblin woman
named Thoggle. Lodgings are available (common
quality—DPB), but the only food served is Fairy Fruit
(p426), at 1gp per serving.
A trail of blood crosses the road and leads off into the
snow.
A bottomless, 20′ wide chasm interrupts the road. Any
who cannot cross it must turn back.

The path passes through a wood of sweetly blossoming elder trees. Amid the trees are gravestones, some
bearing names of PCs’ deceased relatives. Laying flowers
upon a relative’s grave grants the PC a +1 bonus to Saving

The path climbs a tall hill, its top carpeted with wildflowers. Butterflies of all hues flit around. Any who sleep here
amid the flowers regain 1d6 HP.
The path crosses a wooden bridge over rushing river. A
sylvan centaur (DMB) named Cmbrogh guards the way,
challenging the strongest PC to defeat her in (non-lethal)
unarmed combat.
The path passes through a 3′ high tunnel in the roots of
a giant willow. 2d6 sprites (DMB) dwell among the roots
and harass passing PCs.

The White Way

This gravel road twists through a gloomy, bewildering
twilight forest. The White Way is utterly colourless; those

A road paved with dark grey stones crosses the path. It
is a side-road leading (in either direction) to Absynthe

The path fords a sparkling stream that meanders into a
cave mouth in the valley wall. The cave is a side-road to
Catland (p35).
The path passes a crossroads in the midst of a field of
golden corn. A wooden signpost indicates that the other
road leads to “Spoondrift” (to the right) and “WattleTown” (to the left). Both ways lead to Whyforth (p32).
Within the space of a breath, the sun begins to set. A

Tallowspire (p35).
2d6 hollow, lupine creatures formed of rasping husks

Fairy Nobles and
Their Dominions
The mighty rulers of Fairy and the weird realms over which they hold dominion.

W

hile the ancient beings who rule realms within
Fairy seldom have direct dealings with the
mortal world, Dolmenwood and its inhabitants are sometimes embroiled in their inscrutable machinations. The main fairy nobles and realms that appear
in the folklore of Dolmenwood are described here. Many
more exist and may be heard of in rumour and folktale.

The Blind King

A terrible iron-crowned giant with grey, sagging skin, hair
stiff with frost, and empty eye sockets. Though sightless,
the Blind King senses the echoes of all that comes to pass
within his drear realm, Gloomhold. All of the King’s servants are blind, for his countenance brings eternal death.
The Blind King has no contact whatsoever with Dolmenwood and mercilessly imprisons any mortals who trespass
in his realm.

The Realm of Gloomhold
A vast, lightless realm of perilous mountains, fathomless
chasms, and smothering fogs.
The Fortress of Absolom: The Blind King rules from the
obsidian fortress of Absolom, which stands at the summit
of a great peak known as the Mountain of Whispers.
The dungeons of Absolom: Mortals speak fearfully of the
fortress’ dungeons, whose darkness is so profound that it
seeps into a mortal’s mind, erasing all memory of light.

The Cold Prince

A cruel, alabaster-skinned frost elf, erstwhile ruler of all
Dolmenwood, whose mind has been twisted by centuries
of exile in his realm of Frigia (see History, p14). The Cold
Prince is chief of one of the major factions in Dolmenwood.
See Cold Prince, p48.

The Realm of Frigia
A realm of hoar-cloaked forest and snowy peaks.
The Palace of Ruvanaith: The Prince’s ice-palace, Ruvanaith, sits in a hidden mountain valley and can only be
reached by air.
Magically warded: All erstwhile paths between Frigia
and Dolmenwood are magically warded, leaving the frostrealm deeply isolated in an obscure recess of Fairy. See The
Ring of Chell, p20.

30

The Blind King

Duke Mai-Fleur

A wild-spirited fairy with an elf father and a human
mother, crowned with holly and ivy, whose dreadful anger
and heartening laughter are ever imminent. Mai-Fleur
rules the fairy realm of Diuthurnia. He is renowned as the
most accomplished hunter ever to set foot in Dolmenwood.

The Realm of Diuthurnia
A moderately sized realm of dense, primal forest.
Castle Ravenmere: Deep in a pathless tract of wood is the
Duke’s castle, Ravenmere, which is ruled by his wife.

Mortal Dominion—Hunting Grounds
Duke Mai-Fleur rules a small area of eastern Dolmenwood
(hexes 1402, 1502, 1503, 1602) in addition to the forest realm
of Diuthurnia.

Encounters in Dolmenwood
The Duke spends three out of every four seasons hunting
with his retinue in the tangled depths of the forest and
beyond. The Wild Hunts which cross over from Fairy into
Dolmenwood are under the command of Duke Mai-Fleur.
See hex 1502.

The Duke Who Cherishes
Dreams

A ficklesome being, ruler of Hypnagogia, who takes a variety of guises, as suit his whims. In the presence of mortals
or elves, he usually takes the form of a corpulent, robed
courtier bearing wondrous trinkets of illusion and dream.

The Realm of Hypnagogia
A disorienting dimension of endless, mazy forest where a
playful, dream-like sentience pervades all things.
The Alabaster Spire: The Duke Who Cherishes Dreams
rules from his fortress, the Alabaster Spire. His greatest
treasure is his library of dreams, wherein the reveries and
nightmares of every mortal in Dolmenwood are archived.

Mortal Dominion—The Dark Mirror
The waters of the Dark Mirror in Dolmenwood (hex 1802)
are traditionally counted as a part of the Duke’s dominion.
The dreams of the mortal folk of Dolmenwood pool in the
Dark Mirror and are dredged by the Duke’s sailors.

Ygraine and Meagre’s Reach
The Duke was traditionally an ally of the sorceress Ygraine.
Their relationship has become strained of late, as he holds
Ygraine responsible for the irksome repeating dreams of
the people of Meagre’s Reach (hex 1703).

The Earl of Yellow

A mirthful, ochre-skinned satyr with horns of shimmering
ivory and a mane of radiant gold. The Earl rules the realm
of Whyforth and a portion of central Dolmenwood. While
he seldom visits the mortal world himself, the Earl takes an
active interest in the doings of mortal folk in his dominion.

The Realm of Whyforth
A realm of golden plains and rolling meadows.
Spoondrift Castle: A towering fortification of spiralled,
yellow sandstone—seemingly carved from a single piece,
by the whimsy of the wind—from whence the Earl rules.

Mortal Dominion—The Yellow Wood
The Earl’s dominion also encompasses part of central
Dolmenwood (hexes 1106, 1205, 1306, 1406), known as
the Yellow Wood. The Earl’s emissaries—enigmatic elf
knights clad entirely in yellow and riding atop great golden
wolves—patrol this area of Dolmenwood and visit Prigwort in secret.

The Goblin King

A lithe, silver-haired elf of jealous, sardonic temperament
who has ruled over goblinkind since ancient times. He
loves music and cavorting, often accompanied by hordes
of goblin followers. The Goblin King is feared among
mortals for his love of whisking children away to his realm,
Goblinhold, where they are imprisoned in his befuddling
dungeons. The Goblin King keeps many names, some of
them public and some known only to a few individuals.
(His true name is known only to himself, of course.)

The Realm of Goblinhold
A flat and barren plain of rocky wastelands and mazy
swamps. The sun of Goblinhold is merciless and its moon
is bewitching.
Castle Muddlemoot: The Goblin King’s castle looms at the
centre of Goblinhold. The castle has a whimsical sentience
of sorts and works to befuddle and mislead those unfortunates who pass through its gates and wander its seemingly
endless mazes, courtyards, and dungeons.

The Goblin Market

The Fealty of Prigwort
The town of Prigwort (hex 1106) is located within the Yellow
Wood and its folk secretly pay fealty to the Earl of Yellow.
If the town were ever seriously threatened, the Earl would
certainly lend his aid.

Winding pathways from all over Fairy converge on the
market of the goblins—an important centre of commerce
in the timeless realm. It is here that goblins and fairies of
all other kinds gather to trade weird and fantastic wares.
Some few mortals of cunning bent (e.g. Drunes) find their
way here too, and are welcomed by the goblins, who make
no discrimination with whom they trade.
The true location of the Goblin Market is unknown, though
some believe it to be situated within Castle Muddlemoot.

The Hag Thorn-Rosy

A mistress of illusion, Thorn-Rosy typically takes the form
of voluptuous, silk-robed giantess. She is the proprietor of
a dimension-hopping bath-house known as the Baths of
Astralon, where she dwells in palatial suites in the upper
floors. She is known for her changeable temperament,
her iron-fisted rule of the bath-house, her fits of sudden
mirth, and her love of gold. Though she spends her days
surrounded by interdimensional nobility, she has little
true respect for rank, preferring to consort with those who
have the talent to reach above their station.

The Baths of Astralon
An extravagant bath-house where fairy nobles, powerful
magicians, astral travellers, and the like may find rest and
recuperation. The bath-house drifts throughout Fairy and
may be reached via portals in many realms and strange
dimensions.

The Hag Thorn-Rosy

32

In the mortal world: The bath-house occasionally manifests beside pools or rivers in the mortal world. Mortals
are not permitted entry as guests, but may apply for
employment as maids or furnace-tenders. Adventurers
may also, upon occasion, gain an audience in the baths
with an eminent individual seeking emissaries, servitors,
or mercenaries.

Part One | Secr ets of Dolmenwood

King Pusskin

A grimalkin king who has completely abandoned Fairy and
“gone native” in his domain in the mortal world. As is the
fate of any fairy noble who takes up permanent residence
in the mortal world, King Pusskin has faded, over many
centuries, into a dilute presence that pervades his dominion, no longer having a fixed, physical form. In time, he will
fade entirely into folklore.

Mortal Dominion—The High Wold
King Pusskin’s presence is felt around the town of Lankshorn (hexes 0609, 0610, 0710, 0711, 0712, 0809, 0810, 0811,
0910, 0911), manifesting as a series of odd by-laws and
taboos that, if not respected, bring down his wrath.

Lady Belladonna

An elf lady of refined taste and capricious nature. Her eyes
are blue as glaciers, her hair is crimson and wildly backcombed, and her garb is of black lace and cobwebs. Lady
Belladonna is a rare, wandering noble, and the whereabouts of her ancestral dominion are unknown. Some speculate that it was destroyed in war or disaster. She roams in
Fairy (where she is treated with respect) and in Dolmenwood.

Encounters in Dolmenwood
In the mortal realm, Lady Belladonna typically takes on
the guise of an alluring, well-bred lady in distress, seeking
the aid of adventurers in some grave matter. Inevitably the
quest they undertake for her is under false pretences. Characters seldom escape a quest for Lady Belladonna without
new enemies, a criminal reputation, or worse.

The Lady of Midnight

A grim elf lady with skin the colour of rock and hair like
living shadow. The Lady of Midnight rules the beleaguered
fairy realm of Everborne. She is a cool-headed leader and a
great poet who inspires her afflicted people to great valour.

The Realm of Everborne
A domain of dismal thorn-forests and broken deserts. The
harrowing moon of Everborne looms ever-full.
The City of Tainglass: At the centre of Everborne stands
the walled city of Tainglass, with its great garrison, eternally beleaguered by mindless hordes that descend from
the moon. The Lady of Midnight remains in the city, in
solidarity with her people.

Mercenaries and Alliances

Lady Belladonna

The Lady of Spring
Unending

A cruel elf woman of eternally youthful complexion, clad
in white, with golden hair falling to her feet. The Lady is
the half-sister of Princess Andromethia (p34), banished
from her native realm of the Blossom Fields after poisoning her own brother in an attempt to take the throne.

Mortal Dominion—The Death Glades
Exiled from Fairy, the Lady lingers in a small dominion
in north-western Dolmenwood (hex 0402). Despite her
cheery name, the lady’s lands are dreaded—few who set
foot in her ever-blossoming glades are seen again by
mortal eyes.

The Lady’s Beauty
Some say that the Lady of Spring Unending is the most
beautiful woman in Dolmenwood, and no small number
of mortals have wandered into her dreaded lands wishing
to catch a glimpse of her.

In an attempt to break the siege of Tainglass, the Lady
of Midnight accepts aid from all quarters. She has been
known to enlist mercenaries from the mortal world, in
times of dire need. She would enter into an alliance with
any faction that could tip the balance of her eternal battle.
Indeed, servants of the Cold Prince have recently fought
their way to Tainglass, seeking an audience with the Lady
to discuss the possibilities of a coalition.

Lord Gladhand

Prince Mallowheart

The Realm of the Gladding-Gloam

Mallowheart is the estranged half-brother of the Cold
Prince (p30) and foster father of the magician Ygraine
Mordlin (p84).

A fathomless expanse of lush, tropical gardens with an
infinite variety of flowering plants.

The Realm of Ravenwild

A portly, blue-skinned elf lord with broad, violet eyes
and a prodigious, ivy-like beard. Gladhand dresses in
pied garb of padded silk and has a fondness for absurd
masks. Lord Gladhand can step between his realm, the
Gladding-Gloam, and the mortal world at will and can take
mortals back with him, if it is his wish.

Shandycoiffe Manor: A rambling manse of mahogany and
teak, situated atop a bluff overlooking the gardens. The vast
hordes of servants who toil in the manse’s gloomy interior
seldom know whether their enigmatic Lord is at home or
off on one of his wanderings.

Ruler of Ravenwild, also known as Prince Seven-Past-Noon.
A decadent, cruel, and capricious frost elf who regards
mortals as mere playthings. His sallow lips and skin are
blackened by frostbite. He dresses in robes of rich fur and
wears a crown of iron thorns and fused diamonds.

A wild, desolate realm of eerie pine woods and treacherous
bluffs. Ravenwild is unpopulated by sentient life.
Nooning Keep: Mallowheart’s palace of granite and obsidian stands upon a lonely isle on a haunted lake.

Encounters in Dolmenwood

Encounters in Dolmenwood
Lord Gladhand is a trickster who often wanders Dolmenwood in various guises. He delights in toying with mortals,
taking a special interest in adventurers. One of his
favoured tricks is to take on the guise of a kindly magician,
send adventurers on a dangerous quest, and then assume
the role of their antagonist. When he tires of his tricks, he
reveals himself, then disappears with a chuckle.

Prince Mallowheart comes and goes as he pleases within
Dolmenwood’s bounds, though the ring of Chell bars him,
as it does all frost elves (see The Ring of Chell, p20). The
Prince and his entourage of sadistic knights, amoral courtiers, and jaded ladies are sometimes encountered upon
the roads of Dolmenwood, either charging toward some
unknown destination or arrogantly setting up court in
the middle of the road, forcing beings of lesser stature to
trudge through the underbrush.

Princess Andromethia

The ruler of the Blossom Fields is of half-elf, half-satyr
heritage, with a single spiralling horn above her left ear and
the hoof of a goat in place of her right foot. She is a kindly
woman of ancient years, yet appears eternally young.

The Realm of the Blossom Fields
Located in an obscure region of Fairy, the Princess’s
domain consists of a wide expanse of carefully tilled farmlands, rolling hills, and wild meadows. Her dominion is
famed among mortals for the pastoral beauty of its timeless blossom fields, where a person may rest and dream for
a century, without a care in the world.

Mortal Dominion
The Blossom Fields are partially coexistent with a small
region of rolling meadows to the south east of Dolmenwood (hexes 1212, 1311, 1312).

Encounters in Dolmenwood
In the balmy days of high summer, mortals of light spirit
and good intent may chance upon the Princess and her
courtiers, picnicking among the fields of her dominion in
the mortal world (see hex 1312). Her hampers contain the
most heavenly luncheon snacks that one could wish for.

The Prince Who Is Seven

A world-weary elf lord—ruler of the realm of Lampwrack—
who manifests as seven identical individuals. Surrounded
by a thousand courtiers and petty nobles, six of the Prince’s
seven forms dance with elf-ladies and dine at overflowing
banquet tables, while one dwells in near-isolation, in a
forgotten tower in an obscure reach of his palace.

The Realm of Lampwrack
An endless waste haunted by husk-like beings that devour
the souls of mortal and fairy alike.
The ruined city of Harkthold: At the centre of Lampwrack
stands the ruined fairy city of Harkthold, where the Prince
Who Is Seven holds his courts, which are host to a ball and
banquet that persist without end. A languid decadence has
taken hold here over centuries beyond memory.

The Prince’s Research
The private form of the Prince is absorbed in a study of
the magical arts of Fairy. He seeks to revive his mythical
ancestor, the vanquished First King of Lampwrack, who
he believes has the power to return the kingdom to its
former glory.

Queen Abyssinia

The Queen of Blackbirds

A raven-haired, black-eyed elf lady, cloaked in crows’ feathers, who rules over the fairy realm of Absynthe. The Queen
is aloof and ignorant to the concerns of mortal folk, but is
for the most part benign toward any mortals who should
cross her path.

The Realm of Absynthe
A great, phantasmagoric thorn-wood and a vast estate of
frozen gardens and dark, cold lakes.
Blackwood Manor: The Queen’s brooding manse, formed
of a forest of shadows. Visitors frequently become lost for
all eternity within its benighted halls.

Former Mortal Dominion—Hag’s Addle
In ancient times, the Queen’s dominion encompassed the
region of Dolmenwood now known as Hag’s Addle. She no
longer maintains this erstwhile domain and has no interest in the mortal world.
The Hag: The Queen’s sister (now known simply as the
Hag) haunts Hag’s Addle, where she has been exiled for
millennia for her wicked deeds. See p82 for full details
on the Hag.

The Queen’s Banquets

Ruler of Catland, also known as the Queen of All Cats. The
fearsome Queen Abyssinia is a fairy of odd heritage, half
elfish, half grimalkin. She appears as a tall, slender woman
dressed all in silver, with straight, silver hair, green, feline
eyes, and needle-like claws as long as her fingers. She is
volatile, reckless, spiteful, and whimsical.

The Queen of Blackbirds holds great balls and banquets
upon barges in the lakes of Absynthe, as she once did upon
the river Hameth. It is said that mortals who find their way
to Absynthe are welcomed at the banquets.

The Realm of Catland

A mercurial being who shifts between a multitude of physical forms, all with cerulean skin and golden, rope-like
locks. Ruler of the infinite city of Tallowspire, Hador values
aesthetic beauty above all else and is known as a collector
of unsurpassed taste.

A hidden realm of gloomy woods, mazy rocks, and bewildering caverns. This is the native realm of grimalkins.
Murquine Palace: The palace of Queen Abyssinia: a palazzo
of some fantastic proportion, its domes, spires, halls, and
parlours said to extend infinitely.

Former Ally of the Cold Prince
Queen Abyssinia was once an ally of the Cold Prince, but
spurned him long ago.

The Regent Hador

The Realm of Tallowspire
An infinite city whose catacombs are said to date from
before the creation of the mortal world.
The Palace of Sighs: The palace of the Regent, walls studded with jade and opal, seemingly constructed by and for
giants. The parlours, studies, and vaults of the palace house
objects of exquisite beauty collected from obscure reaches
of Fairy and the mortal world.

Wood Gods
Godlings that have dwelt in Dolmenwood since the dawn of time.

T

he Wood Gods are a manifestation of the spirit
of Dolmenwood—or, seen the other way around,
the forest may be a physical manifestation of the
Wood Gods. Though the first humans in Dolmenwood
worshipped these entities, this religion (Gwyrae) is now
outlawed by the Pluritine Church. Among humans, the
Wood Gods are now largely absorbed into the half-truths
of folklore. Eleven Wood Gods are described here, but
others—now disappeared—existed in the distant past.
The Wood Gods are neither good nor evil and, despite
the allusions in the names mortals give to them, they are
neither male nor female—as powerful otherworldly entities, they transcend human conceptions of gender.

Ambule

A smiling, pot-bellied giant with red clay flesh coated in
thick, trailing mosses and a single, hexagonal eye of absolute blackness. Ambule is a manifestation of the mutability
of earth, from silt to mud to rock.
Relationship with humans: The folk of northern Dolmenwood once worshipped Ambule, propitiating the Wood
God for protection and good fortune. Ambule is now
forgotten to all save those who study ancient gods.
Locus: Ambule slumbers in the chalky chasms beneath
a treeless, flat-topped hill at the eastern edge of Dwelmfurgh (hex 0805). Atop this hill stands the sole remaining monument to Ambule: a tall column of roughly hewn
chalk, carved with hundreds of names. The chalk column
marking the godling’s sleeping place has some power still,
if one carves one’s name into its surface.

Cwrnus—The Green Man

A portly, merry giant with twinkling emerald eyes and a
benevolently smiling, leaf-ringed visage. Cwrnus is a manifestation of the fecund growth of trees, mosses, and creepers throughout Dolmenwood, dressed in a cloak of moss,
with a crown of holly. As the plants beloved of Cwrnus rely
on the waters of Dolmenwood for life, Cwrnus was a close
ally of the water-dragon Gheillough in ancient times.
Relationship with humans: Before the coming of the
Pluritine Church to Dolmenwood, the people of the Wood
worshipped Cwrnus as King of the Wood. He was revered
as a god of feast and plenty, mirth and debauch, master
of hops and ale-craft, and lord of the hunt. Of old, the
ivy-wreathed face of the Green Man was carved upon every
inn and way-sign in Dolmenwood.
Modern remnants: If one looks closely, one can still find
the face of Cwrnus and the symbol of his dominion—a
cruciform oak—among the old stones and carvings of
churches and gravestones, a near-hidden echo of the past,
amalgamated into the trappings of the monotheistic Pluritine Church.
Suppressed by the Church: Worship of all Wood Gods—but
especially that of Cwrnus—was swiftly stamped out by
the Church upon its conquest of Dolmenwood some 1,200
years ago (see History, p14), but the Green Man lingers
still in local folklore to this day.
Poisoned by tainted waters: The poisoning of Dolmenwood’s waters by Atanuwë (also see Gheillough) has greatly
diminished the already failing power of Cwrnus.
Supplanted by Atanuwë in folklore: Folk tales tell that
the Green Man was slain by the Nag-Lord, who usurped
his position as folkloric King of the Wood. The new bearer
of that title is not well-loved, and many tales speak of the
day when Cwrnus will sprout anew from the soil and defeat
the Nag-Lord to reclaim his rightful title.
Locus: Suppressed by the Church and slowly poisoned by
Atanuwë’s toxic influence, Cwrnus no longer has the power
to manifest physically, instead existing in a disparate form
throughout the verdant undergrowth of the Wood.

Wood Gods and Worshippers
Wood Gods are beings of godling status, bound to
some aspect of the mortal world. As such, while they
can bestow magical powers upon worshippers, they
cannot grant spells in the way that true deities can. The
god of the Pluritine Church, for example, is of a higher
order of magnitude than the Wood Gods.

Embala

A gargantuan lamprey-like monstrosity with seven spherical eyes, a ring of writhing blue tentacles around the
mouth, and numerous smaller, suckered mouths along
its underbelly. Embala is a manifestation of the cold depths
of the Groaning Loch.
Relationship with humans: Embala was once primary
among the deities (known as “Gwyrigons”) worshipped
by the witches of Dolmenwood (see Witches, p72), who
named the Wood God “Embala of the Husk.” The witches
associate Embala with dreams, prophecy, and madness.
The Mirrors of Embala: Embala could only be contacted via
a set of three crystal mirrors of entrancing beauty, known
as the Mirrors of Embala (see p75), possessed by the
Queen of all Witches. The loss of two of the mirrors many
centuries ago made communion with Embala impossible.
For some witches in the modern day, the ancient quest to
recover the mirrors becomes an obsession.
Locus: Embala lies in a comatose slumber in a deep crevice
at the base of the Groaning Loch (hex 1204).

Ertta

A giant, black-scaled serpent, wreathed in mist, with
seventeen heads and a like number of tails, coiled in on
itself with each head devouring a tail in a bizarre cycle of
perpetual digestion and growth. Ertta is a manifestation
of the power of the skies and winds of Dolmenwood and
is especially active on stormy days.
Relationship with humans: Ertta is one of the three
primary deities (known as “Gwyrigons”) worshipped by
the witches of Dolmenwood (see p72), who name the
Wood God “Ertta the Devouring Mother.” The witches associate Ertta with ageing, death, and decay.
Locus: Except when manifest, Ertta exists in a invisible,
disparate form, drifting in the skies, clouds, and winds
above Dolmenwood. The Wood God’s primary locus—
where the witches commune with it—is in hex 0505, upon
the Isle of Yeth.

Gheillough

A great, flashing, silver-scaled water-dragon which is a
manifestation of the energies of Dolmenwood’s waters.
The waters of Dolmenwood carry not only the vital stuff
of mortal life, but also form a conduit for the spiritual and
magical energies that sustain the forest on a subtler level,
with Gheillough a physical manifestation of the cycles of
flowing, gathering, and purification.
In ancient times: Gheillough’s presence kept Lake Longmere unfrozen during the reign of the Cold Prince, when
Dolmenwood was cloaked in ice (see History, p14).
Relationship with humans: Despite Gheillough’s fundamental role as a manifestation and conduit of the magical energies of Dolmenwood, its existence has been long
forgotten by all but the Drune and a few sages of mythology. The Drune, long ago, subjugated Gheillough with their
binding magic, siphoning a portion of its supernatural
force for their own purposes. The sorcerers’ hold on the
godling has not lasted until the present day, however.
Corruption by Atanuwë: The corrupting influence of the
Nag-Lord, oozing out from its chosen domicile in the north
of the Wood, spread quickly through the waters, pooling
in Lake Longmere. The waters became magically tainted,
causing Gheillough to fall into a soporific delirium in the
mud of the lakebed (hex 0606), dispelling the arcane bonds
that the Drune had placed upon it.
Locus: Gheillough once manifested in all the waters of the
great Lake Longmere and the torrent of the Falls of Naon.
In the present day, however, the Wood God lies submerged
in the mud in the depths of the lake (see hex 0606), slumbering fitfully under the noisome influence of Atanuwë.
Connection with Big Chook: Gheillough’s troubled dreams
manifest in the mortal world as a monster of violent
temperament and horrid aspect—the beast known as Big
Chook (see p253), which haunts Lake Longmere. This
relationship is unknown to any but Atanuwë.
Awakening: If Gheillough were to be awoken, the consequent revitalisation of Lake Longmere would be disastrous
for Atanuwë, causing the unnatural Chaotic influences
of the nine-legged lord to be flushed out of Dolmenwood
within a matter of months. The reappearance of Gheillough
would be cause for celebration among the Drune, who
would doubtless connive to reinstate their arcane bonds
around the Wood God.
Slaying: Likewise, the death of Gheillough would tip the
balance of power heavily in favour of Atanuwë, whose
influence would spread rapidly throughout the Wood.

Part One | Secr ets of Dolmenwood

Hasturiel

The Myconom

Relationship with humans: Hasturiel is one of the three
primary deities (known as “Gwyrigons”) worshipped by
the witches of Dolmenwood (see Witches, p72), who
name the Wood God “Hasturiel Thrice-Crowned” and “She
From Beyond.” The witches associate Hasturiel with metamorphosis, vision, and speech.

Relationship with humans: Due to its aeons-long perspective on life, the Myconom has no concern for the comings
and goings of mortals. The voice of the Myconom is aloof
and alien (from the mortal perspective, at least).

This Wood God is a manifestation of fire and embers,
taking the form of a 10′ tall humanoid skeleton formed of
ashen wood, veiled in three concentric layers of energy:
a wreath of writhing, carmine plasma, a sheen of flickering, emerald flame, and an aura of flashing, cyan sparks.
Hasturiel’s single, lidless, flashing eye is terrible to behold.

Locus: Hasturiel dwells in subterranean caverns deep
beneath the gargantuan granite pylon in hex 1404.

Howawi

A tall, humanoid being, cloaked in black, with the head and
antlers of a stag. Howawi is associated with the hunt and
with the symbiosis of hunter and hunted.
Relationship with humans: In times beyond knowledge, a
cult devoted to Howawi existed among the people dwelling
in northernmost reaches of Dolmenwood and the lands
beyond—including the Table Downs and the Northern
Scratch. This forgotten folk lived in mud huts, burned
bog-peat to assuage the wind’s cold bite, and hunted beasts
on the fens. In a scant few sites, remnants of this worship
can be found in the form of time-worn statues of Howawi,
depicted clutching a human skull.
Relationship with deorlings: Although Howawi is all but
forgotten among humans, the godling has power still
among the deorlings (DMB) who tread the wild paths
of the northern woods. The deer-folk regard Howawi as
their spiritual patron—a proud and vengeful god, halfway
between man and beast.
Locus: Howawi lingers in the shadows of the wild woods
in hex 1702.

Limwdd

A gargantuan being of roughly humanoid form, with six
clawed limbs, a head like a chestnut, a tail alike to a curled
fern frond, and earthy flesh teeming with worms. Limwdd
is a manifestation of the fecund soils of Dolmenwood.
Relationship with humans: Limwdd is one of the three
primary deities (known as “Gwyrigons”) worshipped by
the witches of Dolmenwood (see Witches, p72), who
name the Wood God “Limwdd the Quiet Brother.” The
witches associate Limwdd with stasis, growth, and rejuvenation. Witches in union with this Gwyrigon can feel the
pulse of its energy in the ground when walking barefoot.
Locus: Limwdd’s giant body lies curled up a mile beneath
the earth in hex 1006, like a seed awaiting the spring.

38

An incomprehensibly vast bulk of pallid, fungal fibrils
that form a unified whole, concealed beneath the feet of
mortal folk. The Myconom has a vast intelligence, but one
wholly alien and attuned to time scales unimaginable
to mortal minds. It lurks within the soil, spread web-like
throughout the entirety of Dolmenwood, waiting with
aeons-long patience for the age when mortals pass and
the forest returns once more to the rule of the vegetative.

Relationship with mosslings: Though the mosslings of
Dolmenwood have no conception of the Myconom as a
single entity, they worship a variety of its aspects. The
gods of the mosslings are, in sooth, all manifestations of
the fungal over-mind. For example, the entity Blosquom
worshipped by the mosslings of Orbswallow (p173) is an
avatar of the Myconom.
Eyes of the Myconom: The Myconom’s sensory organs are
spread throughout Dolmenwood, for the multitudinous
fungi of the forest are its eyes and ears. It is able to hijack
the body of a sentient fungus and use it as a vessel of verbal
communication. A person under the influence of hallucinogenic mushrooms also comes into fleeting contact
with the Myconom, and becomes a conduit for its senses
and (potentially) voice.
Locus: The Myconom reaches throughout Dolmenwood,
though its presence is especially strong in hex 1505, where
its throbbing “upper brain” lurks amid the fungal forest.

Part One | Secr ets of Dolmenwood

Orsath

A massive, burly ursine creature, 14′ tall, with fur as black as
pitch, teeth and claws of glowing amber, and wide, pitying,
human-like eyes. Orsath is a manifestation of the wild,
rocky hills and caves of north-east Dolmenwood, which
were long utterly uninhabited.
Relationship with humans: Humans have never truly
worshipped Orsath, though the long-forgotten people who
once dwelt in the Table Downs to the north of Dolmenwood
made sacrifices to the Wood God as lord of wild beasts and
guardian of the souls of the dead. Remnants of these practices can be seen in the bear’s-head markings upon ancient
burial mounds in the northern woods.
Destruction of the woods: Orsath’s reign in the wild
woods came to an end when the people of the Table Downs
encroached southwards into the forest. They stripped a
hillside of its trees and dug a mine into the rich veins
of copper running beneath. Orsath looked on in sorrow
and fury as the humans greedily pillaged the earth and
poisoned the woods with toxins leaching from the mine’s
carelessly discarded tailings.
Orsath’s wrath and demise: Finally, in a single day of
carnage, the Wood God arose to end the depredations,
bearing down upon the mine and destroying it, slaying
all within. In the course of the slaughter, the godling was
exposed to the dreadful toxins of the mine, initiating an
unholy alchemy between the toxic metals and Orsath’s
magical essence. Metallic crystals sprouted from its fur,
and in mortification Orsath hid itself in the deepest part
of the mine, its new home and prison.
Locus: Orsath still lingers in the abandoned mine in hex
1801, a twisted shadow of its former self. It no longer has
any power elsewhere in the Wood.

Yorghan—The Stag Lord

A lumbering, 30′ tall humanoid with toad-like skin and
hands, great fronds of shaggy fur hanging between its
arms and torso, and a stag-like, antlered head. Yorghan
is associated with the deer of Dolmenwood and with the
forest’s hidden springs and grottoes.
Relationship with humans: Hunters may whisper a prayer
to Yorghan when setting out into the deep woods, but this
Wood God is otherwise virtually unknown to humans.
Relationship with deer and deorlings: On auspicious
nights, the stags of the Wood gather in a secret grotto in
hex 1305 and bellow in unison, summoning Yorghan. In
addition to the veneration of mundane beasts, the Stag
Lord is sacred to the deorlings (DMB), who regard the Wood
God as the guardian of their dead.
Decapitation: Yorghan’s proudly antlered head is currently
missing, having been stolen by servants of Atanuwë (it
hangs above the Nag-Lord’s throne in hex 0904). Decapitation has not reduced the Wood God’s power, but it does
cause it to stumble blindly when manifest.
Locus: Yorghan drifts in an astral space parallel to hex 1305,
where it manifests on nights on the new moon.

“

o one can ever truly rule Dolmenwood, but that

kingdoms from tiny little thrones and make tiny little promises
they’ll break at the first sniff of power. Whether it’s one of the
human or longhorn nobility, or one of them ageless fairy lords

Atanuwë
The nine-legged chaos godling and its horde of wicked minions.

Faction Overview
Alien to Dolmenwood
The origins of Atanuwë, the Nag-Lord, are unknown,
though the beast is certainly not native to Dolmenwood. The illusion, treachery, and lies that attend its trail
compound the difficulty in tracing its provenance. The few
sages who specialise in the study of chaos godlings have
reached no agreement on the subject.

A Monster Beyond Human Concepts of Gender
As a monstrous being of Chaos transcendent of human
concepts of gender, the Nag-Lord is referred to as “it.”

Absurdity and Dark Comedy
At root, Atanuwë is a godling of dark comedy. Its deeds and
decrees are laced with cosmic irony, absurdity, and horrific
slapstick—all to satisfy its morbid sense of humour.

Entered Dolmenwood 400 Years Ago

Destruction and Debauchery

On first coming to Dolmenwood some 400 years ago (see
History, p14), Atanuwë found a realm dominated by
petty sects vying for such tedious things as military or
magical domination. Perceiving the lack of fun (i.e. depravity, madness, and horrific absurdity) in the place, Atanuwë
set about carving out a dominion from which to ooze its
unsettling influence.

As is the case with all beings of cosmic Chaos, the Nag-Lord
has a passion for wanton waste and destruction. It relishes
the extermination of beauty, the toppling of order, and
the annihilation of knowledge. Connected with this
love of destruction, Atanuwë has a taste for debauchery.
Feasts are constantly upon its tables, mounds of decaying
food crushed beneath piles of fresh delicacies. For beings
inclined towards Chaos, the balls and banquets of Atanuwë
are without rival.

Wrested Sargstone from the Drune
Atanuwë found the ideal location for its court—the Sargstone (hex 0904), which marks the nexus point of two ley
lines. The mortal who claimed himself the warden of the
stone circle (the Audrune Hemlack) was quickly dispatched
and the power of Sargstone subjugated.

Minions Called to the Court of Chaos
Its court established around the Sargstone, the Nag-Lord
sent out a call, inviting all creatures of Chaos to bow before
it. A ghastly menagerie of monsters flowed through the
gates of the court, pledging their allegiance to Atanuwë.
Atanuwë rules its horde with absolute, despotic authority.
Its whim is law to be followed without question.

Creator of the Crookhorns
The rustic breggles of northern Dolmenwood, who heretofore served no master, were corrupted by contact with
Atanuwë, giving birth to the crookhorns.

Poisoned the Wood God Gheillough
Atanuwë’s presence poisons the waters of Lake Longmere,
causing the water-dragon Gheillough (long bound by the
Drune) to fall into a dream-wracked torpor in the mud of
the lake-bed (see History, p14). By keeping the dragon
in this state, Atanuwë has usurped its role as regulator of
the arcane energies of Dolmenwood, twisting the forest
ever more in the direction of the Weird.

42

Ruler of the Valley of Wise Beasts
As a pet project, Atanuwë awakened sentience in the
animals of the valley its Court overlooks. Thus awakened and given humanoid form, the little creatures were
trapped in a nightmare of quaint tea parties and policestate terror under the rule of the crookhorns.

Atanuwë’s Schemes
Become Ruler of All Dolmenwood
The Nag-Lord cannot abide the thought of mortals who live
free from its command, and seeks to increase its dominion
to encompass the whole of Dolmenwood and the lands
beyond.

Marriage With Gheillough
Having usurped Gheillough’s role as regulator of the
arcane energies of Dolmenwood, Atanuwë’s next fancy
is to summon the slumbering dragon-spirit to its side,
complete its corruption into a being of pure Chaos, and wed
it. The spawn of such a union would surpass all conceptions
of wickedness.

Collect the Bones of Holy People
Atanuwë has come into the possession of several saints’
skulls and revivifies them for the amusement of the court.
The skulls’ sanctimonious wailings proved so droll that the
Nag-Lord seeks to expand its collection.

Members and
Organisation
Atanuwë, The Nag-Lord
The nine-legged unicorn godling, whose psychedelic
horn and lunatic braying hold sway over all others in this
faction.

Atanuwë and Worshippers
Atanuwë is a being of godling status, similar in cosmic
stature to the Wood Gods of Dolmenwood (see p36).
As such, while it can bestow magical powers upon its
followers and teach them unspeakable secrets of dark
magic, it cannot grant spells in the way that true deities
can. The god of the Pluritine Church, for example, is of
a higher order of magnitude than the Nag-Lord.

Atacorns
The spawn of the Nag-Lord, birthed by unholy union with
a harridan (see below). Atacorns are unicorn-things with
human features and a bizarre, cruel sense of humour. The
Atacorns number eighteen—one who is slain (Sallowbryg,
see History, p14), three who have remained in Dolmenwood, and fourteen who have roamed to distant lands
to spread woe and discord. Those in Dolmenwood are:
Ignormwm (hex 0807), Crewithyant (in the village of Dreg,
see p140), and Hawalyeer (hex 1509).

Crookhorns
Breggles corrupted by Atanuwë’s wicked magic, who now
carry out its every twisted whim. Crookhorns form a large
(and ever-increasing) force of brigands, making travel in
the northern woods treacherous and threatening the
safety of civilisation to the south (in particular, Prigwort,
hex 1106).

Harpies and Giant Humanoids
Among the creatures of Chaos that have gathered around
Atanuwë and its fell court are a multitude of wicked
harpies, twisted ogres, and evil fomorians.

Harridans
Harridans are witches (see p72) corrupted by Atanuwë’s
dark magic, now twisted into the form of hideous ogres.
They serve the Nag-Lord as lieutenants and soothsayers.

Corrupt Unicorns
Atanuwë’s delight in corrupting that which is pure and
good makes unicorns a favoured target. A small number
of the creatures have been so thoroughly corrupted that
they have come under the Nag-Lord’s banner. These wicked
fairies now serve as Atanuwë’s lieutenants in matters of
war and its assistants in rituals of dark sorcery.

Atanuwë—The Nag-Lord

A monstrous, nine-legged unicorn godling, Atanuwë’s
physical form is mutable, shifting through an unsettling
variety of structure, composition, and colour before
onlookers’ eyes. At one moment, the beast may appear
as a mound of grinning pink jelly with flailing legs and
crooked horn protruding; at the next moment it may seem
to be a gargantuan, flaming unicorn with eyes of ruby and
nine clawed hooves.
Names: The name Atanuwë is rarely used, except by those
of scholarly bent. The beast’s servants commonly call it the
Nag-Lord or “Your Worshipfulness,” while in folklore it is
often referred to by the moniker “Old Shub.”
Demeanour (Chaotic): Cruel, decadent, utterly narcissistic.
Basks in flattery. Loves to mete out absurd injustice.
Speech: Suave insinuations, punctuated with lunatic braying. Speaks all languages (via telepathic communion).

Servants: 7 silver goblins and 5 silver-eyed goats (see 0911).
Location: Woodland cottage in hex 0911.

Summoning Shub’s Nanna

Combat stats: Longhorn breggle (DMB).

The attention of Shub’s Nanna may be
gained by calling out the magic word
“Leeleeglablea” upon a moonlit night
within Dolmenwood. In response,
Nanna may dispatch a number of her
goblin servants to the location of the
one who called. The goblins appear
within 1d6 Turns and may return to
their mistress at will, disappearing into
mist within 3 Rounds.
Local folklore is correct in suggesting that the goblins of Shub’s Nanna
pays a sum of 13sp in exchange for an
unwanted child. She may also grant
other favours (e.g. transportation) in
exchange for especially succulent,
sweet-smelling children.

Cold Prince
The cruel, banished fairy prince who covets his former domain of Dolmenwood.

Faction Overview
Liege of the Fairy Domain of Frigia
The Cold Prince rules the distant fairy realm of Frigia
(p30), which once lay close to Dolmenwood. The natives
of Frigia are the cold-hearted and frigidly beautiful frost
elves. In primaeval days, beyond living memory, they
dwelt solely in the frost-clad forests and mountains of
Frigia. Insatiable curiosity led them into Dolmenwood.

Eternal Winter of the Cold Prince
The frost elves and their liege, the Cold Prince, claimed
Dolmenwood for themselves, as an extension of their
dominion in Frigia, and ruled for centuries beyond count.
When mortals first came to the Wood, they found it blanketed with fairy magic and wracked with eternal ice.

Temporary Absence from Dolmenwood
As was his fickle way, the Cold Prince’s interest in Dolmenwood waned. His courts withdrew into Frigia and the fairy
frosts that had wracked the forest receded. It was at this
time that the human habitation of Dolmenwood began in
earnest. When the Cold Prince’s fancy returned to Dolmenwood, 1,000 years had passed in the mortal world and his
former dominion was claimed by mortal folk.

Banished by the Triple Compact
There followed a period of bitter conflict between frost
elves and humans. In desperation, the King, the Church,
and the Drune formed an alliance known as the Triple
Compact (see History, p14). By a working of deep magic,
these unlikely bedfellows constructed the Ring of Chell,
banishing the Cold Prince and his folk from the mortal
world and isolating them in Frigia, in the distant reaches
of Fairy.

Feared Antagonist of Folklore
Since his banishment from Dolmenwood 850 years ago,
the Cold Prince has faded into folklore, in the minds of
the common people of the Wood. His presence there,
however, is significant: he features in many folktales as
an ancient evil that threatens to overrun the Wood once
more. Snows and cold winters are feared to augur the Cold
Prince’s return to the mortal world.

48

Cruel and Mistrustful
The Cold Prince and his servants are cruel and malevolent,
like the bitter frosts of deep winter, delighting in the agony
of others. Exile has made the Cold Prince utterly insular,
trusting only his closest advisors. He views frost elves
as superior to all mortals and most other fairies (having
only a modicum of respect for the nobles of other fairy
kingdoms).

Magic of Frost and Ice
Like all fairies, frost elves have innate power that mortals
regard as magic. Their frigid, otherworldly beauty and
silvery words are as perilous as their ice-blades. Frost elves
are masters of cold, ice, snow, and frost—they can chill
or freeze living things by touch and they can walk upon
snow-clad ground without trace. The Cold Prince himself
has such dominion over the frigid element that he could,
of old, defy the natural cycle of the seasons and keep the
whole of Dolmenwood locked in eternal winter.

The Cold Prince’s
Schemes
Locate Secret Paths into Dolmenwood
A number of the Cold Prince’s most trusted servants
wander Fairy, seeking hidden routes that would allow
quick access to Dolmenwood. A few paths into the Wood
have been located, but none are expedient.

Destroy the Ring of Chell
The Cold Prince’s immortal mind is consumed with breaking the ward of Chell (p20) and reclaiming his dominion
over Dolmenwood. Those few frost elves who find their
way, through secret paths, into Dolmenwood are charged
to investigate the warding ring and to spy on its wardens,
the Drune. They seek knowledge of any vulnerabilities of
the ward and of any moral weakness in the Drune, employing magic and bribery to tempt mortals to aid them.

Alliance With Another Fairy Noble
The rulers of other fairy realms (see p30) are reluctant to
treat with the Cold Prince, having no nostalgia for the days
of his dominion. Nonetheless, an alliance—if one could be
achieved—could be highly beneficial for the Prince, opening possible paths into Dolmenwood via the ally’s domain.
The most promising candidate for such an alliance is the
Lady of Midnight, who rules the eternally beleaguered
city of Tainglass.

Enclaves of the Cold Prince
The Embassy at the Falls of Naon (0504): By ancient,
uncircumventable decree, the Cold Prince’s embassy to
mortal folk was excluded from the ban of Chell. It thus
remains as his only foothold in the mortal world. The
Ambassador (p50) and his retinue are utterly impotent and reduced to a decadent mockery of their former
majesty. The Drune carefully guard this site, ensuring
that no frost elf may come or go.

The Ruins of Hoarblight Keep (0505): The seat of the Cold
Prince’s dominion in Dolmenwood, of old. If his schemes
to destroy the Ring of Chell and reopen the fairy gates
to Frigia were to succeed, his armies would attempt to
reclaim the ruined keep and reinstate the fairy court.
The Tower of Frost (1007): An ancient fairy ruin, recently
re-inhabited by a servant of the Cold Prince, Lady FrostDust-Shadow.

Organisation
The Cold Prince
Lord of the fairy realm of Frigia since time immemorial,
the Cold Prince is a fairy of the ancient days, wielding
power akin to a godling.

Frost Elf Courtiers
The courtiers, counsellors, and kin of the Cold Prince are
mighty fairies in their own right. As is the way with mortal
and fairy alike, their ranks are riddled with traitors, sycophants, and rivals. Of those whom the Prince can truly
trust, many have been sent abroad to find routes into
Dolmenwood, and the few who have been successful may
be encountered there.

Soldiery
The Cold Prince keeps a formidable army of highly trained
foot soldiers and cavalry. They are confined to the realm
of Frigia, for the time being, but are primed to launch into
full-scale war on Dolmenwood, should the time come.

The Ambassador

An exceptionally tall, brittle-framed frost elf man with hair
like frozen cobwebs and eyes of iridescent blue. Dresses
in high courtly garb—with full, three-tiered, powdered
wigs—at all times. The Ambassador’s name (translated
into Woldish) is Spring’s-Habitude-Vanquished, though
all refer to him as “Your Excellency.”
Demeanour (Neutral): Professionally cold, suspicious, and
condescending. Childish glee at the prospect of talking
with outsiders.
Speech: Rigid courtly form, interspersed with exuberant
giggling. Lectures obsessively on heraldry. Woldish, High
Elfish, Caprice, Old Woldish.
Desires: An end to his vigil. Fresh supplies of fairy foods.
Maps or legendaria relating to the kings of the seas.
Possessions: The Ambassador carries upon a chain around
his neck the Ring of Evermore (worth 17,500gp), crafted of
fairy silver and crowned with a pale ruby. One who wears
the ring becomes invisible and is able to pause the flow of
time in the mortal world for up to five minutes per day. Use
of the ring’s time stop power is perilous: each use requires
a Save Versus Doom (fairies with a +2 bonus) to prevent
falling into a coma for 2d6 days.
Servants: A small, lonesome retinue of six ambassadorial
aides, three chefs, three butlers, and four maids.
Location: The embassy at the Falls of Naon (hex 0504).
Combat stats: Elf courtier (DMB).

Frost elf names: Like other elves, frost elves enjoy being
addressed by curious epithets hinting at their names in the
tongues of Fairy (which they never reveal to mortals). Epithets
are broadly divided into rustic and courtly, depending on the
elf’s origin or the persona they choose to present.

The Cold Prince

A fairy lord of ancient provenance, among the mightiest
and wickedest of all fairies. The Cold Prince is a tall, lithe
frost elf man with pale blue, hoar-crusted skin, angular
features, and wan eyes lined with shimmering red light.
He dresses in kingly robes of snow-white fur, with a ruff
of blue feathers. In the centuries of his banishment from
Dolmenwood, the Cold Prince’s wrath has only waxed—his
mind burns with an obsessive malice directed toward the
mortals of Dolmenwood.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Cruel, disciplinarian tyrant. All his
deeds blaze with a volatile fury and malevolent genius.
Speech: Like the grinding and cracking of ice. Malevolent sneering, maniacally mocking laughter. Woldish, the
Immortal tongue of Fairy, High Elfish, Sylvan, Old Woldish,
Caprice.
Desires: The Cold Prince’s immortal mind is consumed
with but a single goal: break the ward of Chell and reclaim
his dominion over Dolmenwood. See The Cold Prince’s
Schemes, p48.
Possessions: The Royal Crown of Frigia, a cluster of 17
primal ice crystals melded into his skull—each crystal is
worth 5,000gp, if extracted. The Rimeblade (see Combat
Stats), Staff of Mortality (see Combat Stats).
Family: Five wives, innumerable children sired over countless aeons. His estranged seventeenth daughter, Princess
Snowfall-at-Dusk, is kept imprisoned in a tower in a remote
region of Frigia.
Servants: Countless courtiers, counsellors, and noble kin.
A vast household of servants, cooks, tailors, coiffeurs, court
musicians, librarians, groundsmen, and so forth. A formidable army, primed for war on the mortal world.
Location: The ice-palace Ruvanaith, hidden in a mountain
valley in the fairy domain of Frigia (p30).

Drune
A sinister cabal of sorcerers who covet occult knowledge above all else.

Faction Overview
Masters of the Leys and Standing Stones
The Drune are the unchallenged masters of the standing stones of Dolmenwood, controlling all nodal stones
save for Bafflestone (hex 0907—corrupt), Phandrwyl (hex
1802—created in secret by Ygraine), and Sargstone (hex
0904—usurped by Atanuwë).
They guard secret arts of geomancy for the harnessing and
manipulation of earth energies through the stones, having
painstakingly mapped the many greater and lesser ley
lines of Dolmenwood. A sub-order known as the Audrunes
are the designated masters of the leys and know the secrets
of travel along them, both to other locations in the wood
and to otherworldly realms beyond.

Wardens of the Witching Ring
Among the Drune’s chief activities in the Wood is the tending of the Ring of Chell—the vast artificial ley that encircles
Dwelmfurgh (see The Ring of Chell, p20), preventing
the exiled Cold Prince from returning to Dolmenwood.
The Drune maintain their vigil against the return of the
Cold Prince with deadly earnestness, for they wish to share
arcane dominion over Dolmenwood with no one.

Origins in a Faraway Land
The Drune migrated to Dolmenwood from elsewhere
long ago. They are a folk apart from the other humans
of Dolmenwood, marrying only among their own kind.
Their hair is straight and raven-hued, their complexion is
ghostly pale, and their voices are clear and strident.

Last Remnant of the Triple Compact
As wardens of the Ring of Chell, the Drune are the last
remnant of an ancient alliance, known as the Triple
Compact, that expelled the Cold Prince from Dolmenwood.
The other factions that partook in this alliance—the Pluritine Church (p66) and the Duchy of Brackenwold (p56)—
have long forgotten their pact and its deadly significance.

Hoarders of Arcane Knowledge
Key to the tenets of the Drune sect is the hoarding of
knowledge. They regard knowledge as sacred and more
valuable than a mortal life.

Common Folk Fear to Speak Their Name
Common folk refer to the Drune by euphemisms such
as “the Watchers of the Wood” or “the Hooded Men,” for
the name they call themselves—the Drune—is said to be
accursed.

52

Occult Binding and Subjugation
A significant portion of the Drune’s occult potency stems
from spirits and godlings that they have bound and subjugated. The Drune also apply these techniques to lesser
beings as a means of amplifying or creating arcane force.
Kidnap and sacrifice by the Drune is feared as a fate worse
than death by the common folk of Dolmenwood.

Magic of Shadow and Flame
These two energies have long been allies to the Drune. All
Drunes can see in utter blackness and they may summon
flickering green flames to their service at will.

Constructs of Wicker and Bramble
Having dwelt exclusively in the forest for many centuries, it is natural that the Drune’s studies have led them to
dominate their environment. They possess occult powers
of commanding and transmuting wood and plants, and
creating servitors of wood, wicker, and bramble.

The Drune’s Schemes
Reawaken the Entity Gheillough
The Drune, of old, profited greatly from their dealings with
the mysterious power in the waters of Lake Longmere.
Contact with the entity was lost when the Nag-Lord tainted
the waters of the Lake, but the Drune seek to reawaken
Gheillough.

Entrap and Subjugate Atanuwë
The Drune view the coming of Atanuwë with strictly pragmatic eyes—the Nag-Lord is a godling whose powers must
be subjugated and harnessed to further their own ends.
If the Drune were to succeed in this scheme, their occult
dominion over Dolmenwood would be nigh complete.

Reclaim Dominion Over Lost Nodals
The Drune bitterly rue the loss of Sargstone (0904)—
stolen by Atanuwë—and Bafflestone (0907)—corrupted
by Atanuwë.

Locate the Energy Disturbance on Ywyr
Fluctuations in the energy flows of Ywyr imply the existence of an unlawful fifth nodal somewhere along the ley
line’s course. The clandestine stone is located in Chateau
Mauvesse (hex 1802), Ygraine’s magic concealing it from
the Drune’s ever-searching gaze.

“Seek, Know, Keep”—the Drune rede, referring to their avaricious quest for arcane knowledge.

Members and
Organisation
The Elder Phanatarch
The chief of all Drunes in Dolmenwood and ruler of the
Aegis dwells in the crypts of the Drune Lodge, attended
by nine spirits.

The Aegis
Members of the Aegis—the Drune high council—dwell
with their families in the Drune Lodge and spend their
days coordinating occult schemes, judging conflicts, and
handing down policy. Other Drunes consider them bureaucrats, necessary yet at times terrible.

The Drunemoot
Moonlit meetings—overseen by at least one member of
the Aegis—are sometimes called to mete out justice or
discuss recent goings-on. On such occasions, as many as
thirty Drunes may appear, though gatherings of less than
a dozen are more common.

The Audrunes
Drunes tasked to watch over the stones and mind the leys.
Each nodal stone within Dolmenwood is guarded by an
Audrune, many of them living hermit-like in its vicinity.

Cottagers
The remainder of Drune men live with their families in
isolated dwellings throughout the Wood. Until a cottager
is called upon by the Aegis to perform some official duty,
he spends his days scavenging ruins for lost grimoires,
sleeping in crypts and dream-talking to ghosts, brewing
virulent poisons, recording omens and auspices, and tracking the doings of the breggle noble houses.

Drunewives
Wives of the Drune who practice inherited crafts of
herbalism, pottery, and song. Their songs—known as
notions—are enchanted, as are their kilns, which they
use to construct small clay servitors called kilnlings. Each
household and its property are owned and managed by
the Drunewife.

Braithmaids
The adolescent daughters of the Drune, who roam the wild
regions of Dolmenwood, singing enchanted melodies and
foraging for magical herbs. Some Braithmaids marry a
Drune, becoming a Drunewife, while others join the ranks
of the witches (see p72).

Lampers
The adolescent sons of the Drune, who spend their days
and nights in gruelling ritual and occult study. Drune boys
are raised to be initiated into the cabal on the night of their
17th birthday. Only the sons born to Drunes can become
Drunes, and every Drune is born into a specific station
within Drune society.

Caduceus Doome—Elder
Phanatarch

A gaunt, vault-pale human man of imposing height,
crowned with the finger bones of his mightiest forebears
and swathed in black. His beard and hair are tangled like
bramble thickets. A baleful green fire flickers in his pupils.
Titles: Known in folklore as “the Owl King” and to other
Drunes as “the Bone King.”
Demeanour (Neutral): Cool-minded, scheming, manipulative. Pulls at his bony fingers, as if removing rings.
Speech: A dispassionate whisper that penetrates all noise.
Woldish, Old Woldish, Drunic, Liturgic, Sylvan, a smattering of High Elfish.
Desires: To forge a deeper alliance with the witches, ushering in a new era of Drunedom where the occult energies
of male and female are united. To procure saintly relics
and turn their power (oft ignored by the Drune) against
Atanuwë.
Possessions: Vorpal Knife (see Combat Stats). Amulet of
Refraction (p398). 2 magic rings (see Combat Stats). The
Crown of Old Droun—formed of the finger bones of other
men who once held the title of Bone King (worth 15,000gp).
One who wears the Crown ages at one-fifth of the natural
rate and experiences fever dreams wherein Drunes long
deceased whisper their rede.
Servants: Scribes, archivists, spies, and so on. A personal
guard of 12 shadows (DMB). 9 phantoms known as the
Auldweathe—the spirits of Braithmaids who elected to
sacrifice their mortal lives in order to serve their king for
all eternity. They fulfil many functions, including those of
guards and advisors (for their memories span back to the
old days of Drunedom).
Location: In the crypts of Drune Lodge, hex 0507.

The Aubrathon
A towering figure in the history of the Drune is the
renegade known as the Aubrathon. Mightiest among
the Drune Aegis seven centuries past, the Aubrathon
was a genius theoretician who rocked the order of
Drunedom with his iconoclastic approach to magic
and his refusal to bow to tradition.
He was eventually expelled from the order after astrally
infiltrating the vaults of the Witch Queen and absconding with the Onyx Mirror of Embala (see The Mirrors
of Embala, p75). (The mirror remains sealed in the
Aubrathon’s magically veiled tower in hex 1103.) In
exile, he haunted the fringes of Dolmenwood for some
years, pursuing secretive occult schemes, before finally
vanishing without a trace. The mystery of his true fate
remains a matter of intense speculation.
In hindsight, some of the Drune have reappraised the
controversial deeds of the Aubrathon, honouring his
relentless innovation and iconoclastic spirit. They
erected a monument in Northern Scratch (hex 0201),
at the site of his final discourse with his acolyte Cylaeth,
before he strode north into the bog and disappeared.

astrally along the course of energy at a rate of 24 miles per
hour.

Human Nobility
The Duke of Brackenwold and the noble houses which rule all of Dolmenwood.

Faction Overview
House Brackenwold and Its Vassals
The entirety of Dolmenwood—along with the lands to
the south, east, and west—falls under the dominion of
the Duke of Brackenwold. Certain regions of the Wood
fall within the traditional domain of one of the noble
houses that swear fealty to the duke: the human houses
Guillefer, Harrowmoor, Hogwarsh, Nodlock, and Mulbreck
(discussed here) and the longhorn houses Malbleat,
Murkin, and Ramius (see Longhorn Nobility, p62).

Supplanted Earlier Folk of Dolmenwood
The noble houses of Dolmenwood and the common folk
who serve them migrated to Dolmenwood from a land to
the south-east some 1,200 years ago (see History, p14).
A highly organised and militaristic people, they quickly
supplanted the rustic folk who had inhabited Dolmenwood
before them, replacing Gwyrae worship with their monotheistic faith—the Pluritine Church (see p66).

Fungal Deterioration of House Mulbreck
Formerly a Lady of upstanding morals and loyal ally of the
duke, Lady Mulbreck is now a recluse. Within the decaying
walls of her chateau, her family hides an unsettling secret:
they are addicted to psychedelic fungus that riddles their
home, addling their minds and infiltrating their bodies.
Lord Mulbreck, believed dead by the outside world, is
secretly imprisoned in the dungeons—now a fungus-riddled monstrosity.

Lord Nodlock, Lackey of Lord Ramius
Ruler of a small dominion sandwiched between the larger
realms of the longhorn lords Murkin and Ramius, the
cowardly Lord Nodlock has become embroiled in their
rivalry. His grovelling at the feet of Lord Ramius is all that
saves his realm from attack by Lord Murkin.

The Human Nobility’s
Schemes

The Dreaming Nobles of House Guillefer

Maintain Lordship of Dolmenwood

The nobles of House Guillefer share rulership on a sporadically rotating basis. Those who are off-duty spend their
days in enchanted slumber, dallying for years and decades
in the lands of dream. Even when awake, they are dreamy
and aloof, favouring poetry and quiet contemplation over
politics and intrigue. It takes much to move them to action.

The political machinery of the duchy has one primary aim:
to maintain (and ideally expand) its dominion. To this end,
the nobles fortify borders, stifle revolutions and political
intrigues, and dispatch their enemies.

Expel the Nag-Lord

The villages within their domain have drifted out of their
control. The Drune control Odd (hex 1403), Ygraine rules
Meagre’s Reach (hex 1703), and Blackeswell (hex 1604) is
nigh-forgotten and virtually independent.

The beast Atanuwë has long been a thorn in the side of the
Dukes of Brackenwold, with its occupation of the northern
Wood. The harrying of mid-Dolmenwood by Atanuwë’s
forces, in recent times, has inspired Duke Thespian’s ire
and increased his urgency to act.

House Harrowmoor Harried by Atanuwë
The northernmost lands of House Harrowmoor sit now
within the accursed Nagwood—the festering dominion
of the beast Atanuwë. The wicked servants of Atanuwë
have recently ventured ever further afield, with skirmishes
occurring in the woods close to Harrowmoor Keep and
the town of Prigwort. Lady Harrowmoor is overseeing
the establishment of a fortified garrison in Prigwort, as a
precaution against the war she fears is brewing.

The Lax Rule of Baron Hogwarsh
Under the rule of the current Baron Hogwarsh, the Barony
of the High Wold grows wild and lawless. The roadways are
no longer safe and local people whisper fearfully of war
brewing among the longhorn noble houses.

56

Claim the Wild Lands to the North
The haunted and disputed lands beyond Dolmenwood—
the Table Downs and the Northern Scratch—never fell
within the Duchy, but have always lingered on its periphery, like delectable pastries just out of arm’s reach. Many a
duke has laid plans to claim them, only to be thwarted by
their remoteness and peril.

Root Out the Drune
Once allied against the Cold Prince (see History, p14),
the uneasy affiliation between the Drune and the duchy
has soured to a truce and, in the last century, putrefied
into outright animosity. The Church is behind this gradual
drift in attitude among the dukes, but the sentiment is
cemented in Duke Thespian’s heart: the Drune’s clawing
after power in Dolmenwood must be halted.

Members and
Organisation

All inhabitants of Dolmenwood are regarded as subjects of
the duke, thus the membership of this faction is, in theory,
vast. In practice, however, not all beings that creep beneath
the forest’s eaves care one whit for the word of Duke Thespian III. The following people and groups represent the
practical membership of this faction.

Noble Houses
The heads of the noble houses, their extended families,
servants, and private soldieries.

Knights
Each noble house (naturally including the ducal house
Brackenwold) is served by a number of knights, themselves
regarded as members of the lower nobility.

Soldiery
The armies of the duchy are sizeable and well-disciplined.
The duke’s longbowmen have especial renown.

A tall, unceasingly elegant human woman
in her mid-fifties, with a narrow jaw and long
black hair. Dresses in pale violet, pearl-studded
robes. Wears a silver crown adorned with leaf-shaped

Lord Edwin
Guillefer

A slight human man, with lank blond hair,
a mousy moustache, and a dusty, greyish

actually born nigh 200 years ago—like all of his family, he
has spent the majority of his adult life in magical slumber.
Guillefer, a poet and harpist, is a friend of Ygraine the

mid-30s, with sumptuous black locks and eyes

Baron Sagewine
Hogwarsh

A lithe, dashing human man in his mid-thirties, with a head of wayward golden ringlets
and a neatly trimmed beard. Dresses in purple
silk pantaloons and salmon doublets, with a fashionable
neck ruff. Hogwarsh inherited lordship of the High Wold as
a callow youth, following the untimely death of his father
in a fencing mishap. He is known for his lax attitude to
the law, more interested in wine and debauchery than in
the maintenance of order. He is a friend of Lord Malbleat
(p64), who shares his taste for carousing.

and utterly vain. Dismisses dissent with an arched brow

Lady Pulsephine
Mulbreck

A voluptuous human noblewoman, 50 years
of age, with cascades of pristinely curled silver
hair and an awkward, slightly hunched posture.
Lady Mulbreck—in addition to her husband and four of
their eight sons—is addicted to the weird fungus that
infests her home. Mycelia spread insidiously through her
body, visible as a fine, violet lacework just beneath her skin.
Demeanour (Neutral): Sharp wit, piercing intelligence,
remorseless cunning. The fungus that addles her mind has
inflamed her appetites and eaten away at her conscience.
(In former times, Lady Mulbreck was Lawful.)
Speech: Sweet drivel, indignant roaring. Punctuated with
fits of dry coughing. Woldish, Old Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: To keep the fate of Lord Mulbreck utterly secret,
in order to maintain her indulgent rule (she has essentially imprisoned him within her dungeons). To maintain
control of the Falls of Nyf (hex 1112). Would pay 300gp for
one of the moss-covered corpses from the caves at the
Falls—discreetly delivered—which she covets as a delicacy.
Possessions: The Crown of Bogwitt (locked in a concealed
safe in her manor)—a gold circlet studded with purple
tourmaline (worth 8,000gp).
Family: Her husband, Lord Mulbreck, imprisoned in the
cellars of Bogwitt Manor, reduced by the fungal infestation
to a bloated, lumbering monster. Eight sons, born as sets
of identical twins.

Servants: A small guard, wardens at the Falls of Nyf (hex
1112), groundsmen, cooks, butlers, librarians, etc.
Location: Bogwitt Manor (hex 1210).
Combat stats: Level 3 knight (DMB).

Lord Harald
Nodlock

A slovenly human man in his mid-fifties, of
prodigious girth and balding pate. Hunched
and dishevelled beneath the weight of a heavy
rust-red robe (which appears to be a hastily unhung tapestry) slung over his shoulders. Bulbous, goggling eyes stare
quizzically. Though he would never admit it, Nodlock is a
lackey of Lord Ramius (p65).
Demeanour (Neutral): Presents himself as battle-hardened and iron-willed, but is a coward and has never seen
combat. Drunk at almost any time of day. Flies into a rage
at any mention of his neighbour, Lord Murkin (p65),
who threatens Nodlock’s northern border.
Speech: Gruff drawl, accompanied with frequent belching
and spittle spray. (It is advisable not to sit too close to Lord
Nodlock when he speaks.) Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: Nodlock is a simple man: he desires little beyond
fine wine, fine food, and fine women, spiced with the occasional amusing execution.
Possessions: The Rod of the Wyrd—a melodramatically
named heirloom of House Nodlock. What it lacks in occult
power, the rod makes up for in mundane value: it is set
with diamonds to the value of 10,000gp.

Servants: A retinue of sycophants and advisors who oversee the castle and borders during Nodlock’s frequent alcohol-induced slumbers. A poorly trained standing army.
Groundsmen, cooks, butlers, librarians, etc.

Family: Happily unmarried. Has many illegitimate children, but no heir.

Combat stats: Level 3 knight (DMB).

Location: Nodding Castle (hex 0210).

Longhorn Nobility
The breggle noble houses which have ruled the High Wold since ancient times.

Faction Overview
Houses Ramius, Murkin, and Malbleat
Three breggle nobles currently rule over large portions of
the High Wold: the powerful and respected Lord Ramius,
the belligerent Lord Murkin, and the sadistic Lord Malbleat.

Earliest Mortals in Dolmenwood
The origins of breggles are lost in antiquity. They have lived
in the environs of Dolmenwood for as long as any records
show, and were the first mortal Kindred to dwell under the
forest’s frost-rimed boughs, in ancient days when the Cold
Prince ruled supreme.

Ancient Nobility
The longhorns hold their distant forebears to be those
bold few breggles who ventured into the ice-clad courts
of the Cold Prince and pledged him their fealty, desiring
the elevation of their own kind. These early days among
the high-born of Fairy instilled in the longhorns a love of
all that is noble, a proclivity which drives them to this day.

Sorcerous Blood
In addition to their political might, longhorns possess
a degree of sorcerous power, derived from their ancient
dealings with the Cold Prince. The gaze of the longhorns
is greatly feared among the ranks of human aristocracy.
Petty human lords often enlist sorcerous aid when attending the court of a longhorn.

Age-Old Enemies of the Drune
Following the betrayal of the Drune by the longhorn
woman Hraigl, some 1,500 years ago (see History, p14), a
bitter hatred between Drune and breggles has smouldered.

In the Service of the Duchy
The longhorn aristocrats are counted among the noble
houses loyal to the Duke of Brackenwold, ruling the High
Wold side by side with humans. Intermarriage of breggle
and human nobles is commonplace.

Nominally Follow the Pluritine Church
The longhorn nobles and their subjects are nominally
aligned with the Church, though their loyalty is born out
of political convenience, rather than devotion. It is sometimes noted that the feeling may be mutual—no breggle
saints exist within the host of the blessed.

62

Lord Murkin’s Aggressions
Lord Murkin has eyes on the lands of his southerly neighbour—the human House Nodlock—and is amassing troops
near the border. Only the protection of Lord Ramius (whom
Lord Nodlock is a lackey of) prevents outright war.

House Ramius Divided
Twenty-two years ago, unearthed genealogical documents
purportedly revealed Lord Malbleat as the rightful head of
House Ramius, through the line of his mother, Lady Shankhollow. Lord Ramius’ interpretation of the documents
naturally differed, and a feud ensued, growing quickly to
violence. Baron Hogwarsh (then a mere youth) intervened,
ruling that the lands of House Ramius should be divided.
Malbleat was granted the eastern portion and Ramius the
western.

The Longhorn Nobility’s
Schemes
Vanquish Rival Longhorn Houses
The longhorn nobles are greatly occupied with bitter
in-fighting, with petty familial rivalries amplified to
blood-feud and vendetta. Each noble wishes to achieve
dominance over his kin, whether by political subjugation, warfare, or sorcery. The longhorn nobles’ scheming
to outdo one another largely hinders the advancement of
their shared goals.

Maintain Lordship of the High Wold
At many points in history has an imperious human noble
of one kind or another emerged to challenge the longhorns’ right to dominion in the High Wold. Always have
the tenacious longhorns prevailed, but the risk of outside
meddling in breggle rulership of the region remains.

Extend Breggle-Country Southwards
Collectively, but primarily as individuals, the longhorns
seek to reverse the trend of the gradual human domination
of the High Wold and extend their rule further south. Each
of the nobles has his eye on the courts of High-Hankle and
the throne of the foolish Baron Hogwarsh.

Destroy the Drune
The longhorns hate the Drune for their power, arrogance,
and long-standing vendetta against all breggle-kind. They
seek to eradicate the Drune from the High Wold and bring
the lands of Dwelmfurgh under longhorn rule.

Pluritine Church
The dominant religion of the mortal folk of Dolmenwood in modern times.

Faction Overview

See Religion in Dolmenwood, DPB for details on the religious tenets, cosmology, holy symbols, and origins of the
Pluritine Church.

Origins in a Distant Land
The Pluritine Church is not native to the Dolmenwood
region, but originated in a distant land that is now the site
of pilgrimage and sometimes political strife.

Monotheistic and Evangelistic
According to Church doctrine, there exists but One True
God. Deities of other religions are regarded as personifications of aspects of God or one of the ascended saints.
The Church aims to convert non-believers and bring them
into the fold.

One God, Many Saints
Daily practice focuses on venerating the host of saints,
rather than on God Himself, who remains somewhat
abstract. Each place of worship is therefore dedicated to a
particular saint, whose blessings may be bestowed upon
the faithful.

Supplanted the Gwyrae Religion
In the early days of the Church in Dolmenwood, 1,200 years
ago, missionaries flooded the forest, drawn from far and
wide to bring the Word of God to the folk of the Wood.
Gwyrae shrines in hamlets and villages were commandeered and converted into chapels venerating the saints of
the Church, and a profusion of wayside shrines was established throughout the wilds of the forest.

Official Faith of the Duchy and Beyond
The Church is the officially sanctioned religion of the
Duchy of Brackenwold and many kingdoms beyond. The
political clout of the Church is not to be underestimated—
many a young prince is advised by a gaggle of condescending clergy, and many a devout duchess unquestioningly
follows the holy edict of the Church. Such is the Church’s
power—acting as counsellor and conduit of the Divine
Word while subtly enforcing its own agenda.

Military Might
The Church wields significant military power, though it
prefers to only exert this force in tandem with the kings
and nobles who support it. Nonetheless, should the need
arise, the Church could muster a great army from the ranks
of its Holy Orders and sanctioned battalions.

Disappearing Shrines and Ebbing Power
Over the last century, the many wayside shrines of
Dolmenwood have disappeared, due to the corrupting
influence of Atanuwë (see Shrines, p22). While most
villages still maintain a church, the old gods and spirits of
folklore play an increasingly important role in the minds
of everyday folk.

The Ruined Abbey of St Clewyd
The capstone of the Church’s former power in Dolmenwood, the Abbey of St Clewyd, now lies in ruins (hex 0906),
purportedly haunted by evil powers. All attempts to clear
the ruins have failed.

Miracles and Magic
Adventurers who dedicate their lives to serving the Church
in wild and dangerous lands (e.g. clerics, friars) are granted
the ability to directly channel divine power in the form of
holy spells. High-ranking, non-adventuring priests (e.g.
the Bishop of Brackenwold, p69) can channel the power
of God by performing elaborate rituals in holy places. The
average rural vicar has no magical power.

The Church’s Schemes
Locate and Restore the Shrines
The Bishop of Brackenwold ardently seeks to locate and
re-sanctify the vanished wayside shrines. The force behind
the disappearance of the shrines is not currently known
to the Church, though they suspect an arcane origin. The
Drune are their prime suspect.

Rebuild the Abbey of St Clewyd
The ultimate achievement of the restoration of the Church
in Dolmenwood would be the reconstruction of the ruined
Abbey of St Clewyd, in the heart of the Wood (hex 0906).
The Church does not know the true cause of the abbey’s
destruction, but (incorrectly) suspects Atanuwë’s involvement.

Stamp out the Drune and the Witches
Under the authority of Bishop Sanguine, the Church has
become more actively antagonistic toward the Drune and
witches of Dolmenwood, perceiving both (inaccurately) as
devil-worshipping sects. Current Church policy is to root
out both sects, wherever they are encountered.

Members and
Organisation
Saints
The most exalted servants of the Pluritine Church, whose
holy deeds have merited them a place at God’s side. Upon
death, the bodies, clothing, and possessions of such individuals are venerated as relics, and have magical potency.
No living saint currently resides in Dolmenwood.
Feast days: The feast days of the 100 saints venerated in
Dolmenwood are listed on the Dolmenwood Calendar
(available as a free download from dolmenwood.com).

The Bishop of Brackenwold
The head of the Church within Dolmenwood is Bishop
Sanguine, resident in Castle Brackenwold (hex 1508).

Clerical Orders
The Church’s militaristic arm takes the form of three Holy
Orders of warrior-priests who venture into dangerous
realms to vanquish enemies of the Church.
The Order of St Faxis: The order of seekers, based in the
Seminary of 100 Martyrs, in Castle Brackenwold. Clerics
of St Faxis follow an edict to root out practitioners of dark
magic—those who truck with devils or deal in necromancy.
The Order of St Sedge: The defenders of the Church; clerics
who protect the lands of the Church from invaders. Based
in the Swinney Tower, by Prigwort.
The Order of St Signis: The order of Lichwards; those who
watch over the dead and hunt revenant corpses and spirits
which rise from the grave as undead. Based in the Silent
Tower, in High-Hankle.

Priests
The mainstream of the Church, from lowly curates,
through village priests, to the archbishops who determine
the course of the Church across all the lands where it has
dominion.

Monastics
Ascetics who live cloistered lives of prayer, fasting, and
contemplation. In the present day, there is but a single
monastery within Dolmenwood—the Refuge of St Keye,
in hex 1307. Monastics are therefore seldom encountered
by the everyday folk of the Wood.

Friars
Wandering ascetics who have vowed to leave the austere
life of the cloister and take to a homeless existence on
the road. Friars are tasked with bringing the good word
of the Pluritine Church to the poor, downtrodden, and
disease-ridden in borderlands at the edge of the civilised
world (such as Dolmenwood). Friars maintain only a loose
affiliation with the Church proper, being granted the fiat
to carry out God’s will as they see fit, without recourse to
the ecclesiastical hierarchy. A large number of saints lived
as friars.

Witches
A secretive sect of women who commune with ancient gods in the deep woods.

Faction Overview
Worship Secret Gods—the Gwyrigons
The witches of Dolmenwood worship ancient Wood Gods
(see p36) known as the Gwyrigons—Ertta the Devouring Mother, Hasturiel Thrice-Crowned, and Limwdd the
Quiet Brother. Witches also once worshipped the Gwyrigon
Embala of the Husk, with whom contact has been lost.
The presence of the Gwyrigons in Dolmenwood and the
witches’ worship of them are closely guarded secrets.

Encounters With the Gwyrigons
Each Gwyrigon may manifest physically at a specific site
within Dolmenwood, known as its locus. Mortals who
wander to such a place by chance may witness a Gwyrigon’s
manifestation. Men invariably report such encounters
as horrific—a brush with monstrous powers inimical to
humankind. Some women of sensitive nature (especially
those of Drune blood) perceive instead an otherworldly
beauty. Such women show potential as witches and may
be contacted and offered initiation into the craft.

Initiation Over 13 Lunar Cycles
A woman who has begun her initiation is not regarded as a
true witch until thirteen lunar cycles have passed. During
this period, the Gwyrigon and initiate commune in dreams
until, upon the night of the thirteenth full moon, the
woman is accepted into the sisterhood as part of a coven.
This occasion is marked with a night-long, visionary ritual
wherein the initiate ingests a psychedelic mandrake brew.

Spiritual Union With a Gwyrigon
Upon acceptance into a coven as a full member of the
sisterhood, a witch enters into a permanent spiritual union
with one of the Gwyrigons, her mortal soul becoming a
fibril of the Gwyrigon’s vast consciousness. The witch thus
becomes the eyes of the Gwyrigon in the mortal world,
gaining supernatural powers in return.

Extended Lifespans
Union with a Gwyrigon extends a witch’s mortal lifespan
and delays the ravages of ageing. While the average witch’s
lifespan is extended by a only decade or so, the most
powerful witches may live for several centuries, periodically taking on new identities to remain hidden.

Never Speak of Dreams
Discussing one’s dreams with others is taboo within the
sisterhood, for dreams are the private realm wherein each
witch communes nightly with the Gwyrigon.

72

Hidden in All Spheres of Society
While some witches live as hermits, many dwell among
other mortals, practicing their craft in secret. Unbeknown
to those around her, any woman—from the lowliest scullery maid to the noblest lady—may be a witch.

The Witches’ Cant
Witches speak a secret cant that allows them to identify
one another.

Charms, Hexes, and Witches’ Brews
In addition to the powers gained by union with a Gwyrigon,
witches guard a body of occult lore, passed among
members of the sisterhood. It is thus that witches can cast
arcane spells (primarily taking the form of charms and
curses) and brew potions. Witches are infamous for their
use of psychedelic plants as primary ingredients in the
brews they concoct.

Familiars, Corn-Dolls, and Manikins
Witches frequently bind common animals as familiars
and craft magically animated servitors to guard their lairs.

The Witches’ Schemes
Maintain the Secrecy of the Craft
The primary aim of the witches is to pass their craft on to
future generations, ensuring that communion with the
Gwyrigons continues. Their teachings and lore are to be
kept safe from outsiders’ eyes and the Gwyrigons themselves guarded against external attack or tampering.

Recover the Mirrors of Embala
The witches once possessed three crystalline mirrors, used
to communicate with the lost Gwyrigon named Embala of
the Husk. One of these mirrors is in the possession of the
Queen of the Witches, but the whereabouts of the other two
are unknown. See The Mirrors of Embala, p75.

Locate the Hoaghryn
Witch lore speaks of a child—known as the Hoaghryn—
destined to be the Queen of the Witches and to rule all
Dolmenwood in the name of the Gwyrigons. Witches who
subscribe to this prophecy scour the Wood in search of a
baby born under certain auspices, with the spiritual capacity to be initiated into the sisterhood as a child. Some view
the quest for this messiah-like being as the true aim of
witchcraft.

Members and
Organisation
The Gwyrigons
The Wood Gods worshipped by the witches. The witches
count three extant Gwyrigons (Ertta, Hasturiel, and
Limwdd—described below), two who have passed away,
and one with whom contact has been lost (Embala of the
Husk—see The Witches’ Schemes, p72).
Ertta the Devouring Mother: A sleepy power who has
dominion over ageing, death, and decay. Ertta is associated
with the sky and the winds, and is most easily contacted
on stormy days. Ertta’s primary locus is in hex 0505, upon
the Isle of Yeth. See p37 for more information on Ertta.
Hasturiel Thrice-Crowned: Also known as “she from
beyond.” Hasturiel has dominion over metamorphosis,
vision, and speech and is associated with fire. Hasturiel’s
primary locus is in the gargantuan granite pylon in hex
1404. See p38 for more information on Hasturiel.
Limwdd the Quiet Brother: Has dominion over stasis,
growth, and rejuvenation. Limwdd is associated with seeds
and the depths of the earth. Witches in union with Limwdd
can feel the pulse of its energy in the ground when walking barefoot. Limwdd’s primary locus is in hex 1006. See
p38 for more information on Limwdd.

Initiates
Women who have witnessed the manifestation of a
Gwyrigon and begun their initiation into the sisterhood,
lasting thirteen lunar cycles.

Eyes of the Gwyrigons
Witches who have completed their initiation and entered
into spiritual union with a Gwyrigon are known as “eyes”
of the Gwyrigon in question. They make up the vast bulk
of the sisterhood.

Covens
The primary means of organisation among witches is the
coven: a group of up to thirteen (called a “witches’ dozen”)
witches in a local area. There is a coven in the vicinity of
each settlement in Dolmenwood, and smaller covens are
scattered throughout the wild areas of the forest.

Priestesses
Each coven is loosely governed by a Priestess who determines the dates and conditions of their gatherings.

High Priestesses and the High Coven
All of the covens of Dolmenwood are at least nominally
under the command of the High Coven, which consists of
three High Priestesses.

The Queen of All Witches
The High Coven is commanded in turn by the Queen of
All Witches. The Queen is near-mythical in the minds of
most witches—none outside of the High Coven have ever
had direct contact with her.

Longmere, hex 0806.

The Mirrors of Embala
According to witch legend, the lost Gwyrigon Embala
of the Husk was, in ancient times, the lord of its kind
and mighty ruler of all Dolmenwood. Myth tells that
Embala could only be contacted via a set of three crystal
mirrors of entrancing beauty—the Mirrors of Embala—
one of malachite (lost, see hex 0701), one of onyx (lost,
see hex 1103), and one of selenite (in the possession of
the Queen of the Witches, hex 0806).
Loss of the malachite mirror: In ancient times, when
war with Frigia wracked Dolmenwood (see History,
p14), an attack on the Palace of the Witch Queen (hex
806) was feared. The Mirrors of Embala were entrusted
to the three High Priestesses, who hid them away. The
malachite mirror was taken far from civilisation, into
the Table Downs, to be guarded in the ruined watchtower in hex 0701. Little did the Priestess know that an
older presence lingered in the tower still. She was slain
and the mirror’s fate lost to history.
Loss of the onyx mirror: The onyx mirror was stolen
some seven centuries ago by the renegade Drune
known as the Aubrathon (p55), who astrally infiltrated the Palace of the Witch Queen. He sealed the
mirror in his magically veiled tower upon Chantery
Isle (1103), where it remains to this day.

Faction Relationships
The attitudes and interactions between each of the major factions in Dolmenwood.

E

ach of the major factions in Dolmenwood has its
own agenda, sometimes sympathetic and sometimes at odds with those of other factions. This
section summarises the relationships between the major
factions, as of the present day.

Atanuwë

Hates the Church and the Human Nobility: Atanuwë is
actively antagonistic toward the forces of Law in the forest
and would like nothing better than to conquer their petty
dominions and warp them into playgrounds of Chaos.
Unaware of the Cold Prince: Atanuwë cares little for
history and has no knowledge of the Wood’s former liege.
Views all others as playthings: Atanuwë views all other
beings as fair game for its cosmic pranks and jokes.

Cold Prince

Unaware of Atanuwë: The Nag-Lord arrived in Dolmenwood many centuries after the banishment of the Cold
Prince and his people back to the fairy realm of Frigia. The
Cold Prince is thus unaware of the corruption of the Wood
by Atanuwë. His immortal ire would be inflamed should
he hear of it.
Hates the Church and the Human Nobility: Although
the Cold Prince has scant knowledge of recent events in
Dolmenwood (i.e. the last eight centuries), his hatred for
those who deposed him burns fiercely still. His dreams of
returning to claim his mortal dominion and enslave his
enemies are frequent and impassioned.
Hates but seeks to treat with the Drune: The Cold Prince
suspects that the Drune—alone among the three factions
complicit in his banishment from Dolmenwood—could
be tempted to aid his return. He knew the sorcerers’ ancestors, of old, and recalls their brazen lust after occult knowledge and power. It is possible that some among them may
be willing to damage the warding ring of Chell in exchange
for deep secrets of fairy magic.
Seeks an alliance with the Longhorn Nobility: Breggles
served the Cold Prince, long ago, and he seeks to rekindle
that loyalty.
Unaware of the Witches: Although witches were present
in Dolmenwood in the days of the Cold Prince’s reign, the
frost elves never paid them any heed.

78

Drune

Lust after Atanuwë’s power: The Drune look upon Atanuwë
with greedy eyes, viewing the Nag-Lord as another potential arrow to add to their arcane quiver. Of course, the
Nag-Lord is not easily bound by Drune magic, and would
require an eldritch trap of the most exquisite design. They
also seek revenge upon Atanuwë for the theft of the nodal
Sargstone (hex 0904).
Disdain the Church and the Human Nobility: The Drune
view their fellow mortals with contempt, using them as
befits their machinations.
Ward against the Cold Prince: Of the three factions that
united to banish the Cold Prince from the mortal world
(the Triple Compact—see History, p14), the Drune alone
remember and honour their role in the banishing. They
carefully ward the Summerstones still, guarding against
the return of the Cold Prince or his minions.
Mistrust the Longhorn Nobility: Breggles once served
the Drune, but betrayed them and destroyed their most
precious relic. Drune memories are long and unforgiving;
many still view breggles as wholly treacherous.
Pact with the Witches: Though the Drune covet the power
of the Gwyrigons, ancient pacts deter them from interfering with the activities of witches. Open collaborations
between the Drune and the Witches are historically somewhat rare, but not unheard of.

Part T wo | Factions and Power s

Human Nobility

Pluritine Church

Allied with the Church: In most deeds, the Church and
nobility are unified. Many in the aristocracy are devout
followers of the Church’s word, and the high clergy gladly
accept the advice of the duke and duchess.

Hates the Drune and the Witches: The Church seeks to
eradicate the Drune and the witches from Dolmenwood,
viewing them as cults of depraved devil-worshippers. The
ancient alliance with the Drune (the Triple Compact—see
History, p14) is all but forgotten to the Church.

Fear Atanuwë: The nobles fear the increasingly bold incursions of crookhorns into Aldweald, but remain unsure of
the true identity and nature of the enigmatic figure known
in folklore as the Nag-Lord.

Turning against the Drune: Traditionally, there was a
creed of non-violence between the Dukes of Brackenwold
and the Drune (a last remnant of the Triple Compact—see
History, p14). Recent Dukes, however, have questioned
this creed, and have initiated a slow-burning campaign to
drive the sorcerers out of the forest.

Fears Atanuwë: The Church fears the increasingly bold
incursions of crookhorns into Aldweald, but remains
unsure of the true identity and nature of the enigmatic
figure known in folklore as the Nag-Lord.

Dismisses the Cold Prince as legend: Time enough has
passed since the days of the Cold Prince’s dominion in
Dolmenwood that the learned eminences of the Church
now dismiss talk of fairy lords as superstitious nonsense.

Dismiss the Cold Prince as legend: Time enough has
passed since the days of the Cold Prince’s dominion in
Dolmenwood that ancient records of his reign are now
dismissed as mere legend.

Tolerates the Longhorn Nobility: There are some among
the Church who view the presence of the longhorn nobles
in the High Wold as an uncomfortable relic of ancient days,
before the coming of the Church to Dolmenwood. For the
time being, the current state of affairs is tolerated.

Allied with the Longhorn Nobility: Humans and longhorns have ruled side by side in the High Wold since
ancient times. While longhorns and humans both tend to
favour their own kind, their alliance is stable.

Allied with the Human Nobility: In most deeds, the
Church and nobility are unified. Many in the aristocracy
are devout followers of the Church’s word, and the high
clergy gladly accept the advice of the duke and duchess.

Tolerant of the Witches: The machinations of the witches
are largely irrelevant to the power plays of the aristocracy, who also pay little heed to the reams of ambiguous
and wildly varying folktale surrounding the witches.
The dukes’ awareness of the vein of witchcraft that runs
through their women-folk reinforces this attitude of
neutrality and unspoken tolerance.

Longhorn Nobility

Fear and hate Atanuwë: The longhorns fear the increasingly bold incursions of crookhorns into Aldweald, but
remain unsure of the true identity and nature of the
enigmatic figure known in folklore as the Nag-Lord. They
harbour a deep hatred of Atanuwë for the twisting of breggles into crookhorns.
Disdain the Church: Although nominally followers of the
Church’s doctrine, the longhorns’ loyalty is born of political convenience, rather than devotion. In truth they are
adherents of Aud frengd Hlerr—propitiating the blessing
of their esteemed ancestors.
Dismiss the Cold Prince as legend: Time enough has
passed since the ancient days when breggles served the
Cold Prince that even the learned now dismiss talk of his
reign as fanciful legend.
Allied with the Human Nobility: Humans and longhorns
have ruled side by side in the High Wold since ancient
times. While longhorns and humans both tend to favour
their own kind, their alliance is stable.
Fear and hate the Drune: The Drune, held responsible for
the death of the longhorns’ ancestor Hraigl, are hated and
feared by all breggles of the High Wold. Seldom do breggles
venture deep into Drune-haunted Dwelmfurgh.
Ignore the Witches: While breggle women occasionally
become witches, the practice of witchcraft is not widespread among the longhorn nobility.

Witches

Hate Atanuwë: To the witches, Atanuwë is an imposter
and its minions a plague upon the forest. The High Coven
regards the creeping influence of the Nag-Lord as the principal threat to their power in Dolmenwood and seeks to
confine the beast to its dominion in the North.
Fear and seek to hide from the Church: The witches are
becoming ever more secretive, following the Church’s
increasing aggression against them.
Pact with the Drune: Ancient pacts deter the witches and
Drune from interfering in each other’s affairs. Witches
typically give Drune men a wide berth while actively seeking to enlist young Braithmaids into their covens.
Ignore the Cold Prince: For the most part, the witches view
tales of the Cold Prince’s reign in Dolmenwood as mere
legend. Those more learned in ancient history view the
chance of the frost elves returning as remote and, even if
it were to come to pass, of little threat to the Gwyrigons
and the craft.
Ignore the Longhorn Nobility: While breggle women
occasionally become witches, the witches have no direct
dealings with the longhorn nobility.
Loosely allied with the Human Nobility: Witchcraft has
a long history among the women of House Brackenwold.
The High Coven communicates regularly with initiates
among the aristocracy.

Factions and
Adventurers
The dealings that the major factions in Dolmenwood have with adventurers.

B

ands of wandering adventurers who delve into
the deeps of Dolmenwood in search of fame and
fortune are typically not directly aligned with any
of the factions detailed previously. This section describes
how each of the major factions of the Wood views adventurers and whether (and under what circumstances) they
may be willing to work with them.

Example Quests

Atanuwë

Escorting to the Embassy: Trusted parties may be enlisted
as guards and scouts to bring an important frost elf to the
hidden embassy at the Falls of Naon (hex 0504).

Mortals who seek to parley with a Chaos-godling are likely
to be disappointed. The Nag-Lord has no interest in the
piffling deeds of mortals, so is just as likely to snack on
adventurers who seek an audience as it is to hear them out.
Affiliation with Atanuwë: Adventurers of Chaotic Alignment who impress the Nag-Lord with their sense of
humour or penchant for wickedness and pandemonium
may receive its “blessing” to wreak havoc in Dolmenwood
as they see fit. Those who submit to the hypnotic bondage
of the Nag-Lord’s gaze (see Atanuwë, The Nag-Lord, p45)
are accepted into the ranks of the faction and entrusted
with a role in its schemes.

Spying on the Drune: Scouting around Dwelmfurgh and
reporting on the doings of the Drune.
Locating nodal stones: The frost elves desire precise information on the location of the nodal stones of Dolmenwood, with especial interest in the stones around the
Witching Ring.

Drune

The Drune mistrust bands of wandering ne’er-do-wells,
but deal with them at times.
Affiliation with the Drune: It is not unheard of for a group
of adventurers to establish an ongoing working relationship with the sorcerers, though such parties are not privy
to the reason driving their odd quests. The Drune look
especially unkindly upon rogues who attempt to seduce
their daughters.

Rewards: Wild feasts and debauchery, magic items (often
with dangerous side-effects), crookhorn servitors.

Trade in magic: The Drune covet magic of all kinds—both
magic items and spell books—and are often willing to
purchase items from adventurers.

Example Quests

Rewards: Gold or precious stones—never magic of any
kind, which Drune hoard absolutely.

Spying and subterfuge: Infiltrating and subverting the
actions of the Church or the human nobility.
Warbands: Joining (or leading, for more powerful characters) bands of crookhorns on raids into human-ruled lands
or attacks on military outposts.

Cold Prince

The few servants of the Cold Prince who find their way
through cunning paths into Dolmenwood are well aware
of their isolation in the mortal world. They are, therefore,
inclined to act subtly, achieving their ends indirectly by
bribing or charming mortals into doing their bidding.
Affiliation with the Cold Prince: While frost elves are
quite willing to pay adventurers and mercenaries for their
aid, they never truly accept mortals into the ranks of the
faction. Elves in an adventuring party may eventually
become trusted allies of the frost elves, if they swear fealty
to the banished Cold Prince.
Rewards: Coins of fairy silver (worth 5gp each), scintillating ice jewels, enchanted fairy trinkets (usually bearing an
inconvenient glamour affecting mortals that wield them).

80

Example Quests
Fetching odd items or substances: The Drune require all
manner of items and substances for their magical practice,
often obtained from scrabey or goblin merchants. The
Drune sometimes trade with more questionable creatures
(e.g. the boggins in hex 0209).
Scouting frost elf activities: The Drune vigorously investigate any report of frost elves or their allies in Dolmenwood,
even if it turns out to be hogwash.
Guarding ritual sites: Trusted (or charmed) parties may
be enlisted to clear monsters from the site of a planned
ritual, and to repel intruders while the ritual is under way.

Drune and Witch Player Characters?
The Drune and the witches are treated in this book as
NPC-only factions which PCs cannot be fully initiated
into. Rules for Player Character Drunes or witches—
along with the secrets of their magic—may appear in
future supplements.

Pluritine Church
Human Nobility

The duke and the nobles who swear fealty to him keep their
plans to themselves, as a rule. Occasionally, a noble may
inquire after the services of an adventuring party to carry
out some covert plot.
Affiliation with the human nobility: Adventurers of
compatible Alignment who swear fealty to a noble may
be accepted into their service. Those who prove themselves
trustworthy and discreet are assigned ever more sensitive
or dangerous quests and granted greater favour. While it
is rare for non-humans to rise far in the ranks of a noble’s
servants, it is not unheard of.
Rewards: Gold, political favours, rank and title, land.

Example Quests
Scouting crookhorn activities: Monitoring the movements of the Nag-Lord’s servants and warning of any largescale incursions into human-ruled lands.
Eliminating monsters: Killing or driving off monsters that
have encroached too close to civilised parts.

Longhorn Nobility

The longhorns of the High Wold have their own servants,
but frequently need unaffiliated agents to do their dirty
work, often against rivals of their own kind (the longhorns
are notorious for their jealousy and antagonism).
Affiliation with the longhorn nobility: Adventurers of
compatible Alignment who swear fealty to a longhorn
noble house may be accepted into its service. Those who
prove themselves trustworthy and discreet are assigned
ever more sensitive or dangerous quests and granted
greater favour. While it is rare for non-longhorns to rise far
in the ranks of a breggle noble house, it is not unheard of.
Rewards: Gold, political favours, rank and title, land.

Example Quests
Spying on other nobles: Longhorns take any opportunity
to insert spies into the midst of their rivals.

The Church has its own servants—including PC clerics and
friars—who are sent on missions into wild and perilous
lands. The faction generally has no pressing need to seek
out adventuring parties.
Affiliation with the Church: Pious adventurers of Lawful
or Neutral Alignment who take an oath of good faith may
be taken into the fold and sent on missions within Dolmenwood.
Unaffiliated relic hunters: The fabled wealth of the Church
attracts procurers of holy relics to its door. The Church
rewards such opportunists, so long as the authenticity of
the proffered items can be verified.
Rewards: Salvation, forgiveness of sins, gold, holy magic
(e.g. healing spells). Those within the ranks of the Church
receive increased responsibility, servitors, holy scrolls or
potions, and occasionally the use of relics.

Example Quests
Locating lost shrines: The Bishop of Brackenwold greatly
desires to locate and restore the many wayside shrines in
Dolmenwood which have mysteriously disappeared in
recent years.
Vanquishing enemies: The elimination or capture of sects
of Drunes, witches, or wicked crookhorns.
Procuring relics: The recovery of lost relics associated with
saints or places holy to the Church.

Witches

Due to their limited numbers and sparse distribution,
witches sometimes require assistance in achieving their
aims and do, upon occasion, enlist the aid of bands of
adventurers and mercenaries.
Affiliation with the witches: Occasionally a witch establishes a regular working relationship with an adventuring party, but in all such cases, the true aims of the witch
remain carefully occluded.
Trade in herbs and fungi: Witches are often keen to trade
or purchase psychedelic or magical substances.

Assassination or kidnapping: Simple and brutal methods
of eliminating rivals, usually performed by unaffiliated
brigands, so as to give plausible deniability.

Rewards: Charms, talismans, or spell casting. Adventurers
in Dolmenwood know that consultation with a witch (if
one can be located) is often the simplest way of acquiring
services such as the unravelling of curses.

Skirmishes: In times of war (or brewing war), adventurers
may be enlisted into warbands or mustering armies.

Example Quests
Fetching magical herbs or fungi: A witch may send
adventurers to retrieve magical specimens from remote
or dangerous parts of Dolmenwood.

The Hag
An evil old woman, bent and decrepit, who haunts the swamp of Hag’s Addle.

A

malevolent, supernatural being with an appetite
for mortal flesh. While she takes on many illusory guises (see Favoured Guises), the Hag’s true
form is that of a crone, bent and decrepit beyond mortal
conception, with eyes as large as saucers and a great, warty
nose. Unbeknown to any of mortal blood, the Hag was long
ago a fairy princess, the sister of the Queen of Blackbirds
(p35). She betrayed her sister and was cursed to spend
eternity in the mortal world, guarding the door to the fairy
realm of Absynthe (her sister’s domain).
Names: The Hag is known to mortals by many names:
Black Allis, Shub’s Nanna (falsely—this name refers to an
entirely different person, see p47), Old Crust-Breath,
and Mother Swithenby. Her true (fairy) name is forgotten
to all but the Queen of Blackbirds.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Depraved, lustful, treacherous.
Loves to deceive, torment, and kill mortals. Fears elf nobles
and anything associated with them.
Speech: Slavering and cackling. Woldish, Old Woldish,
Sylvan, Mewl, High Elfish (rusty).
Desires: Fornication with succulent young mortals. To
feast on the flesh of succulent young mortals. (As a fairy
of ancient years, all mortals are young in the Hag’s eyes.)

Background
Corrupt Fairy Princess
The Hag was once a fairy princess and sister of the Queen of
Blackbirds (p35). A dabbler in dark magic, she delighted
in observing the ravages of time on the mortal world:
decay, disease, and death. Under her influence, the beautiful water-meadows of her sister’s dominion along the
Lower Hameth were corrupted into a festering bog.

Exiled to the Mortal World
When the Queen of Blackbirds discovered all that her
sister had wrought, her wrath was great. The princess was
captured and brought before her elder sister, who decreed
“if thou lovest decay and decrepitude above all, then such
shall be thine own fate.” The wicked princess was exiled
from the undying realm of Fairy, to dwell forever in the
mortal world where all things wane and pass. Imprisoned
in the region of Hag’s Addle, surrounded by the miasma
and decay of the marsh that she herself created, she is
cursed to wither and decay (though never to die).

Cursed Warden of the Way to Absynthe
Sealing the exile with a final, cruel twist, the Queen of
Blackbirds placed a fairy geas upon her sister. The Hag is
compelled to ward the door that leads from Hag’s Addle
into the fairy kingdom of Absynthe, cursed to dwell on the
threshold that she may herself not pass.

The Hag’s Schemes
Release From Her Bondage
Long has the Hag endeavoured to dispel the fairy geas
placed upon her, but ever has she been vexed. She voraciously pursues any possible means of release.

Corrupt the Fairy Realm of Absynthe
The Hag’s sole means of revenge against her sister is to
occasionally allow unsavoury things into Absynthe, via
the door in her hut. She dreams of the wickedness she
would work on her sister’s domain, if she could find a way
to be released from her bondage.

Expand Her Swampy Dominion
The Hag’s foul magic encompasses all of Hag’s Addle—the
region in which she is imprisoned. If she could dispel her
bondage, she would fain extend her miasma further into
Dolmenwood.

The Hag and Factions

Atanuwë: The Hag seeks contact with Atanuwë, hoping to
find a kindred spirit with the power to break the magic that
binds her to Hag’s Addle and the fairy door.
Witches: Individual witches occasionally seek to consult
with the Hag on matters of herbalism or sorcery. Such
contact is, however, strictly on an impromptu basis—no
affiliation between the Hag and the witches exists.

The Hag and
Adventurers

While most mortals shun the foetid marshland of the Hag’s
Addle, adventurers sometimes seek the Hag to consult
her on matters arcane. If well-disposed, she performs the
following services, for a price (see Prices).
Access to Absynthe: The Hag is bound not to allow mortals
or enemies of the Queen of Blackbirds to pass through the
fairy door which she guards (see hex 0908). For a price,
however, she turns a blind eye.
Prophecy: The Hag may see into the distant past and future
to answer a question posed to her. She casts marsh herbs
into her brazier, causing her hut to be filled with noxious
smoke. All present enter a hallucinogenic stupor lasting
for 1d6 hours. The Hag’s prophecy can be heard among
her screeching and wailing. Each character witnessing the
prophecy has a 10% chance of being afflicted with a curse
of indolence: 2-in-6 chance of doing nothing each Round
in combat, earned XP penalised by –50%.
Spell casting: Many of the spells the Hag is able to cast are
useful to adventurers (see Combat Stats).
Bestow vigour / beauty: The Hag can bestow beauty or
vigour upon a mortal, increasing the subject’s Constitution
or Charisma by 1d3 points (to a maximum of 18). This boon
lasts for 1d6 years (though the Hag claims it to be eternal).
Raise dead: The Hag can recall the deceased to life, per the
fairy rune Unravel Death (though her magic is effective
without time limit). In addition to whatever price the Hag
demands (see Prices), someone who truly loves the one to
be raised must forfeit their own life and their immortal
soul. (Raising of the one thus sacrificed is impossible.)

Prices
The horrible price the Hag demands for her services is open
to negotiation. Some examples are as follows.
A living child: To be dismembered and boiled into a stew.
A limb: Freshly severed with her rusty bread knife. The Hag
is happy to cauterise the wound with irons from her fire.
A night of passion: A full night spent in the Hag’s embrace.
This reduces the character’s maximum Hit Points by 1d6
and incurs a –1 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
Gaining a Level removes all penalties and restores lost
maximum HP.
A soul: Extracted via an all-night ritual in her hut. The
character can no longer be raised from the dead.

Ygraine Mordlin
Mysterious sorceress of northern Dolmenwood, lady of Chateau Mauvesse.

T

he mysterious Sorceress of Chateau Mauvesse
and ruler of Meagre’s Reach, Ygraine is a human
woman of noble bearing and patrician beauty.
She appears in her fifties (though she is in fact over 500
years old), with straight black hair to her waist, eyes of cool
grey, and a complexion as pale as moonlight. She dresses
in white lace with a heavy fur robe, lavishly buttoned and
baubled. Upon her brow is a brilliant diamond. Ygraine is
the foremost practitioner of the occult within Dolmenwood, with the capabilities of a Level 15 magician. Her
appearance in Dolmenwood 200 years ago is shrouded in
mystery—few know of her true origins as a mortal fosterling raised in the courts of Fairy (see Background).
Names: The common folk of Dolmenwood refer to Ygraine
as the Sorceress of the North or the Lady of the Mirror
(referring to the Dark Mirror—the lake she dwells beside).
Nobles may refer to her by her mortal name, Ygraine Mordlin, while to fairies she is Lady Heart-Torn-in-Tatters.
Demeanour (Neutral): Majestic, proud. She is a diplomat
par excellence, but is fatigued by her constant duties as
host to all manner of eminent fairies.
Speech: Firm, calculated. Lyrical in the scant moments
when she finds happiness. Woldish, Old Woldish, Sylvan,
High Elfish.
Desires: To escape from the attentions of all aspiring suitors (of which there are many!). Peace in which to conduct
magical research (she has especial interest in magic of
illusion and time-control). To keep the existence of the
nodal Phandrwyl (in the crypts of her chateau) hidden,
especially from the Drune. News of her dear friend and
former music teacher, Lord Hobbled-and-Blackened, who
disappeared when she was a youth (see hex 0101). Also see
Ygraine’s Schemes.
Possessions: Three wands (see Combat Stats). An IounBlade (see Combat Stats). An obsidian Talisman of Protection (p398), carved in the form of a squid. Spell books (see
list of spells in Combat Stats). The breathtaking diamond at
her brow is worth 50,000gp. Her libraries are stocked with
magical scrolls of all manner—given time, she can locate
a scroll of almost any spell.
Family: Ygraine is the foster daughter of the fairy Prince
Mallowheart (p34), to whom she owes her magical
education. Their relationship is troubled, as Ygraine disapproves of her father’s cruelty towards others of mortal
blood. She is the adoptive niece of the Cold Prince (p30),
estranged half-brother of Prince Mallowheart. She has
never met her uncle, but fears and despises him as a tyrant.
Servants: A small personal guard of eight elf knights
(DMB), groundsmen, cooks, butlers, librarians, etc. (possibly also of fairy origin).
Location: Chateau Mauvesse, in hex 1802.

Background
Fosterling Daughter of Mallowheart
Born the daughter of a humble blacksmith in the village
of Meagre’s Reach, Ygraine was stolen by fairies as a babe
and raised as the adopted daughter of the cruel Prince
Mallowheart (p34). Showing a gift for all things arcane,
the child Ygraine was tutored in the secrets of fairy magic.

Inherited Chateau Mauvesse
As an adolescent, Ygraine accompanied her father on
a jaunt into the mortal world and chanced to pass by
the village of Meagre’s Reach and the ruined Chateau
Mauvesse—a long-abandoned palace of Mallowheart’s.
The young Ygraine was struck by the earnest toiling and
tragic merriment of the mortal folk she witnessed and
pleaded with her father to be granted Chateau Mauvesse
as a plaything. Upon her coming of age, he finally agreed
and Ygraine, now a sorceress of great power, returned to
the mortal world, where she has dwelt ever since. Within
the chateau’s fairy-glamoured walls, she ages not.

Created the Hidden Nodal Phandrwyl
Deep in the forgotten crypts of Chateau Mauvesse, Ygraine
summoned an obelisk of obsidian (named Phandrwyl),
tapping the pulsing energies of the ley line Ywyr, which
runs beneath the castle. Intertwined with her own power,
the energies of the obelisk allow workings of great magic.

Wrested Meagre’s Reach From History
Three centuries had passed in the mortal world between
Ygraine’s adolescent visit to Meagre’s Reach and her taking
residence in Chateau Mauvesse, for time in Fairy flows
strangely. She was heartbroken to find the village abandoned following a plague and vowed to restore it to life.
With great magicks of her own devising, augmented by
the power of Phandrwyl, she twisted time, resurrecting Meagre’s Reach as it was 300 years ago, before it was
ravaged by plague. The village now exists in a temporal
bubble, its inhabitants unable to leave hex 1703.

Host to Fairy Diplomats
In the courts of Fairy, Ygraine is regarded as a neutral party
and is constantly called upon as diplomat and arbitrator.
She is thus host to a fatiguing array of fairy courtiers,
including frequent visits from emissaries of the fairy
nobility (see Fairy Nobles and Their Dominions, p30).
The numerous visitors have worn her patience thin. Even
her friendship with the Duke Who Cherishes Dreams
(p31) is strained, due to the bothersome repeating
dreams of the mortal folk of Meagre’s Reach, for which
the duke holds Ygraine responsible.

Ygraine’s Schemes
Root Meagre’s Reach in the Present Day
Ygraine rues her only partial ability to resurrect Meagre’s
Reach and seeks a means of rooting it fully in the present
day, allowing its people to wander freely as they wish.

Prevent Alliances With the Cold Prince
Unbeknown to the Drune, Ygraine plays a pivotal role
in thwarting the plans of the Cold Prince (see p48) by
preventing any alliance among the nobility of Fairy that
might aid his return.

Ygraine and Factions

Ygraine is primarily concerned with the fairy nobility,
and has little time for or interest in the doings of mortals.
Human nobility: Since Ygraine’s appearance in Dolmenwood 200 years ago and her taking up residence in Chateau
Mauvesse, the Dukes of Brackenwold have eyed her with
suspicion. Several times has her right to inhabit the castle
been questioned, but in the end the dukes fear to meddle
with the ways of fairies and sorceresses.
Lord Guillefer: Ygraine met Lord Guillefer (p59) when
he was a youth, at a ball in the dreamlands hosted by the
Duke Who Cherishes Dreams (p31). As kindred explorers of imaginary realms, the two maintain a friendship.

Ygraine and
Adventurers

Ygraine sometimes enlists the aid of adventurers to aid
in her schemes. She also sometimes consults on matters
arcane, having an especial affinity for other female practitioners of the occult.

Starting a Campaign
Notes for the Referee on beginning a new campaign in Dolmenwood.

F

irst, an exhortation to the Referee: make Dolmenwood your own and do not fear to alter, expand,
and amend what you read in this book. As your
campaign progresses, add locations and characters of your
own devising, place adventure modules you enjoy, and
adapt the setting to the tastes of yourself and your players.
This book presents the lore and tools to run campaigns in
Dolmenwood, but the setting comes to life at your gaming
table. Above all: enjoy your journeys in the magical realm
of Dolmenwood.

Campaign Styles
Player-Driven Campaigns
Dolmenwood is presented as a sandbox, hex-crawl style
setting, with a map of wild and semi-civilised lands ready
for PCs to explore in search of adventure. With little
preparation, the Referee can start play in a settlement,
present players with some local rumours of adventure
or intrigue, and allow events to unfold. In this way, the
desires, schemes, and whims of the PCs direct play, guided
by the rumours and story hooks provided by the Referee.

Group Types

The most common setup for a role-playing group involves
a single Referee and a more or less fixed group of players,
each running a single PC. This is not the only possibility,
however. The alternative approaches described below are
sometimes used.
Character stables: Each player creates multiple characters
and chooses which will participate in each adventure. The
rate at which characters advance is slower (as XP is essentially divided between multiple PCs), but the choice of characters allows for greater variety of play. Backup characters
are also instantly available, should a PC die.
Open tables: The Referee invites a large pool of players
to the game, running sessions for whomever can attend,
rather than trying to schedule sessions based on the
availability of a fixed group. This alleviates difficulties in
scheduling sessions, but can lead to continuity issues if
the characters in the party change from one session to the
next. A common solution is to ensure that sessions always
finish at a safe haven (e.g. a settlement), giving characters
the opportunity to come and go between sessions.

Awarding XP: In a player-driven campaign, the standard
rules for awarding XP based on monsters defeated and
treasure recovered work marvellously.

Plot-Driven Campaigns
Alternatively, the Referee could focus the campaign on an
overarching theme or plot, whereby adventures and quests
undertaken by the PCs tie into the unfolding of some great
event in Dolmenwood. A few possible overarching plots
are suggested under Campaign Themes, p90. In plotdriven campaigns, it is common for PCs to ally with one
of Dolmenwood’s major factions, performing quests to
further the faction’s goals.
Awarding XP: In a plot-driven campaign, the standard
rules for awarding XP (primarily based on treasure recovered) can sometimes feel inappropriate. Depending on
the chosen plot, adventures will not always result in PCs
acquiring large quantities of loot, which can slow PC
advancement. The Referee may instead consider awarding
XP for plot milestones. See Awarding XP, p106.

Mixing Campaign Styles
The player-driven and plot-driven styles can of course be
combined. The Referee can set a great plot event unfolding
in the background, with players choosing whether and how
to get involved. Players might make and break alliances
with different factions as the campaign progresses.

88

Customising Tone

Numerous themes weave their way through this book,
each adding its own nuances to the flavour of Dolmenwood. By emphasising or playing down the role of these
themes, the Referee can season the tone of the game to the
tastes of their group.

Setting Expectations
When starting a campaign, check in with the players to get
a feeling for their preferred tone and to establish whether
there are any kinds of content or situations they prefer not
to explore in the game. In this way, the Referee can ensure
the game will be enjoyable for all participants.
Content to be elided: There may be content or situations
that participants are not averse to having come up in the
game but prefer not to explore in detail. Such material may
be mentioned in passing or happen “off screen,” but not be
described in great detail.
Content to be omitted: There may be content or situations
that participants prefer to not engage in at all. Such material should be omitted from the game entirely.

Part Thr ee | Running a Campaign

Whimsy and Horror
In the vein of traditional fairy tales, Dolmenwood
combines whimsical and horrific elements. If one of these
tones is not to the taste of the group, the Referee should
diminish its role.
Presentation: The Referee’s own words are the most
powerful tool for controlling tone. Unsettling details
can either be elided or lingered upon, according to taste.
Consider, for example, the difference between “a skeleton
lies in the bed” and “a skeleton lies in the bed, its eye sockets crawling with maggots feeding on encrusted remnants
of blood and decaying brain matter.” Similarly, whimsical
elements can be brief, passing details, or can be elaborated
into involved scenes.
Removing elements: Some locations in the Wood are very
strongly horrific or whimsical. The Referee should wholly
excise such locations, if desired, perhaps replacing them
with randomly rolled encounters (see Encounters, p114).

Time Period
Dolmenwood assumes a late medieval level of technology, before the advent of firearms and the printing press.
However, later historical periods (early modern tales of
highway robbers and derring-do, for example) also play
a role in the setting’s flavour. The Referee may wish to
emphasise these later historical influences.

Order of St Faxis, can foster an atmosphere of severe rules,
authoritarianism, paranoia, and political corruption.
Rustic folk religion: Referees preferring a lighter tone can
emphasise the Church’s syncretism, as an amalgamation
of the host of saints with the older deities of the Gwyrae
religion native to Dolmenwood. Portray Church-aligned
NPCs as jolly friars and doddering vicars, rather than stern
authoritarians.

The Wider World

There is enough material in this book to run a long-term
campaign fully within the bounds of Dolmenwood, without ever detailing the world beyond. However, Dolmenwood is designed to be easily slotted into a wider campaign
world, should the Referee wish. The following points are
worth considering when doing so.

Environs
Dolmenwood is assumed to be situated in a cool, temperate
region with balmy summers and frosty winters. The Duchy
of Brackenwold is implied to extend beyond the campaign
map, so the Referee should determine its full extent when
integrating Dolmenwood into a wider campaign world.

Other Kindreds

Fairy and its Denizens

If other fantasy Kindreds (e.g. dwarfs, gnomes, etc.) are
present in the wider campaign setting, the Referee may
wish to consider why they do not inhabit Dolmenwood.
This may be due to some historical, political, or religious
quirk of the region.

While the parallel world of Fairy is only briefly described
in this book, it is not uncommon to encounter its denizens
wandering in Dolmenwood. The emphasis placed on fairies
and their world of origin can strongly affect the tone of the
campaign.

Elves: If elves are present in the wider world, the Referee
should decide on their relationship with the elves of Fairy
who sometimes visit Dolmenwood. For example, they
may be the distant descendants of elves who settled in
the mortal world, now a demi-fey Kindred.

Firearms: A simple, flavourful option is to replace bows
and crossbows with early firearms.

Amorality, alienness, and whimsy: As immortal beings
from a world unravaged by time, fairies have a singular
mindset and perspective on life. The Referee’s portrayal of
fairies may range from alien and aloof, to amoral and cruel,
to fanciful and innocent, each bringing its own flavour to
the campaign.
Limiting access to Fairy: As described in this book, the
realms of Fairy are only accessible to those with an invitation. It is thus easy to keep play focused purely within
Dolmenwood.
Adventures in Fairy: Referees wishing to emphasise the
role of Fairy in the campaign may wish to develop their
own adventures in the various dominions of Fairy and
provide PCs with hooks and rumours drawing them hence,
along with an invitation or other means of entry.

The Role of the Church
The Pluritine Church plays a prominent role in the setting.
The Church in Dolmenwood is presented as a largely
benign, somewhat decaying institution, but its role and
prevalence can easily be tweaked to alter the feel of the
setting.
Severe monotheism: Emphasising the bishop’s quest
to eradicate the Drune and the witches, employing the

Religions
Under the Pluritine Church, the culture of Dolmenwood
is primarily monotheistic. Other religions—for example,
cults of Atanuwë (p42) and worship of the ancient Wood
Gods (p36)—do exist, but are suppressed by the Church.
The Referee should consider the Church’s relationship with
other religions present in the wider campaign setting.

Introducing Dolmenwood into an
Ongoing Campaign
Dolmenwood can be added to an ongoing campaign by
placing it somewhere on the world map and introducing
story hooks to draw PCs to the region. A couple of options:
Just beyond the borders: Dolmenwood is located in an area
that PCs have hitherto not explored.
Magical appearance: Dolmenwood magically appears in
an area close to the PCs’ current location, having been lost
in Fairy or veiled from mortal sight by a powerful magical
ward. Previous to the reappearance of Dolmenwood, PCs
may hear rumour of the place in folklore or see it noted
on old maps.

Campaign Themes
Overarching themes that weave through the fabric of Dolmenwood.

W

hether running campaigns of freewheeling,
sandbox adventure or story-driven intrigue,
consider the broad, overarching themes and
mysteries of Dolmenwood. This section presents some
ideas for major themes to weave into the campaign.
Each major faction and power in Dolmenwood (see p41)
has its own schemes, many of which interlock or oppose.
The Referee may choose one of these schemes as a major
theme of the campaign, with player characters either serving one of the factions involved or being swept along on
the tide of great events occurring in the background. Some
suggestions follow.

High Wold Intrigue

The High Wold region in south-western Dolmenwood is a
powder keg, rife with political tension and bitter rivalry
that could explode into war at any moment. The region and
its conflicts are the perfect backdrop for a campaign heavy
on political intrigue, skulduggery, and warfare.
Possible events: Lord Murkin (p65) sends his secret
army (hex 0109) to attack Nodding Castle (hex 0210), coveting House Nodlock’s domain for his own. The lax Baron
Hogwarsh (p60) fails to respond, so Duke Brackenwold (p58) is forced to intercede. Lord Ramius (p65)
manoeuvres to take over Murkin’s domain. Lord Malbleat
(p64) secretly allies with Murkin, attempting to assassinate Lord Ramius by occult means.
PC involvement: PCs could ally with any of the involved
noble houses, acting as spies, assassins, lieutenants, etc.
Alternatively, PCs might form a mercenary company fighting on the side of the highest bidder.

War With Atanuwë

Since Atanuwë’s arrival in Dolmenwood 400 years ago, its
influence has spread slowly but steadily, bringing about
the corruption of the Wood God Gheillough and the loss
of the Pluritine Church’s wayside shrines. Atanuwë’s eye
now turns to warfare, its armies of crookhorns poised to
march on central Dolmenwood. This theme brings the
conflict between Law and Chaos to the forefront, with the
scope for great magic and battles that could permanently
change Dolmenwood.
Possible events: Crookhorn brigands on Fort Road and
Swinney Road disrupt trade to Castle Brackenwold. Attacks
and possibly a full-scale siege on Prigwort (hex 1106)
follow shortly. A large army of ducal soldiers musters at
Harrowmoor Keep (hex 1105), launching a counterstrike.
Meanwhile, Atanuwë succeeds in seizing Tenkystone (hex
903) from the Drune. A force of harpies and harridan
witches is dispatched to the ruined abbey of St Clewyd
(hex 0906), tapping the ley line Lamm in an attempt to
tame and harness the energies of the Chaos Rift that rages
in the ruins.
PC involvement: PCs ally with the Church or the nobility,
taking part in intelligence or combat missions against
Atanuwë’s troops. Alternatively, Chaotic PCs might be
approached by agents of Atanuwë, offering them riches
and magical power in return for acting as spies or saboteurs against the forces of civilisation.

Part Thr ee | Running a Campaign

The Cold Prince Returns

From his frosty domain, isolated deep in Fairy, the Cold
Prince’s hatred of mortals seethes. He seeks to reclaim
his dominion in the mortal world, placing Dolmenwood
under a cloak of eternal winter. A campaign based around
this theme offers espionage, desperate alliances against
the common enemy, and apocalyptic warfare.
Possible events: The Cold Prince (p51), via an alliance with
the Lady of Midnight (p33), establishes an expedient route
from Frigia to Dolmenwood. Troops of frost elves move
in secret, seeking the location of the warding stones of
Chell (p20). The Elder Phanatarch of the Drune (p55) sends
a missive to Bishop Sanguine (p69) to reform the Triple
Compact. The bishop, in his arrogance, ignores the missive,
but Abbot Hargle (p69) suspects something is afoot. Meanwhile, Atanuwë (p42) laughs to see such doom impending.
PC involvement: Abbot Hargle sends the PCs on a clandestine mission to contact the Drune, behind the bishop’s
back. Alternatively, PCs could stumble upon the doings of
the frost elves and find themselves forced to take sides in
a centuries-long struggle.

Restoring the Church

Bishop Sanguine (p69) has vowed to locate and re-sanctify the lost wayside shrines of Dolmenwood and to rebuild
the ruined abbey of St Clewyd. This quest could form the
basis of a campaign heavy on exploration and wilderness
travel, possibly leading to eventual conflict with Atanuwë,
should a significant number of sites be restored.
Possible events: As lost holy sites are restored, Atanuwë
senses ripples of psychic backlash against its corrupting
miasma. Bands of crookhorns and harpies are dispatched
to track down and capture those responsible. Taking
advantage of Atanuwë’s distraction, the Drune secure
Tenkystone (hex 0903) and launch a clandestine raid on
the Court of the Nag-Lord (hex 0904) to rescue the imprisoned Audrune Hemlack. If the creature imprisoned in the
crypts of the ruined abbey (hex 0906) escapes, Atanuwë
attempts to capture it and charm it to service.
PC involvement: PCs are sanctioned by Bishop Sanguine
or his agents to seek out the lost shrines in Dolmenwood.
They may be provided with old maps or documents revealing the former location of various shrines, or rumour of
their current state and whereabouts. Successful parties
may later be tasked with weightier undertakings, such
as exploring the ruined abbey of St Clewyd (hex 0906).
Alternatively, PCs could act as free agents seeking to be
rewarded by the Church for their aid.

Recurring Mysteries
Several recurring themes or mysteries are mentioned
in multiple hexes or concern multiple NPCs. These can
also make for engaging longer-term plot elements.
The Aubrathon: A renegade Drune who, some seven
centuries ago, stole one of the Mirrors of Embala (see
below) from the witches, then vanished from history.
Mentioned in hexes 0112, 0201, 0309, 0710, 1103, and
1903. See p55 for a summary of the Aubrathon’s deeds.
Dewidort of Smerne’s hoard: The ghost of an infamous
highway robber who haunts the roads of Dolmenwood.
His lost hoard is legendary. Mentioned in hexes 0301,
0501, and 0607. Several NPCs seek Smerne’s hoard:
Baron Hogwarsh (p60), Snerd Furroughby (p154),
Carrington Shydewick (p216).
The Flayed Queen: An undead being in the northern
Table Downs whose influence slowly spreads southwards towards Dolmenwood. Mentioned in hexes 0501,
0701, and 1301.
The Mirrors of Embala: A set of three magical mirrors
the witches used to contact the Wood God Embala
(p37). One mirror is in the possession of the Queen of
Witches (p75), but the other two are lost. Mentioned
in hexes 0701, 0710, 0806, 1103, 1903, and 1905.
The vorpal monoliths: Four spectral standing stones
that appear, under certain conditions, in hexes 0106,
0306, 1306, and 1706. Theorised to form an emerging
fifth ley line, the vorpal monoliths are of great interest
to the Drune.

Against the Drune

Directed by Bishop Sanguine (p69) and Sanctus Primus
(p71), the Order of St Faxis is mobilising against the
Drune and the witches. This conflict could form the basis of
a campaign of dark themes, intrigue, and magical warfare.
Possible events: Soldiers and clerics of St Faxis roam
Dolmenwood under an episcopal edict ordering the
rooting out of all unsanctioned magicians. PC magicians
not affiliated with a sanctioned guild may be targeted.
Captured Drune cottagers and witches are paraded
through settlements, on their way to the holy gaol in Castle
Brackenwold (p131). The Drune and the witches form
a deeper alliance and summon magical mists and veils
throughout the Wood, befuddling those who hunt them.
A series of assassinations of Pluritine Church figures is
carried out by renegade witches, who then flee into the
woods. Abbot Hargle (p69) and his allies within the
Church make moves to depose Sanctus Primus or Bishop
Sanguine. If the Church succeed in seriously damaging the
Drune, the warding ring of Chell may collapse, leading to
the return of the Cold Prince.
PC involvement: PCs could ally with any of the involved
factions. The Drune and witches, usually insular and secretive, have especial need of unaffiliated allies.

Running Games
Advice on running exciting, engaging, and mysterious game sessions.

A

dvice on running role-playing games is a vast
and deep subject upon which treatises and tomes
have been written. The advice here covers the
most fundamental topics, but necessarily only scratches
the surface.

The Referee’s Role
Facilitator of Fun and Adventure
The Referee’s primary role is to bring to life exciting adventures for the enjoyment of the group.
Preparation: Before a game session begins, read up on
any Dolmenwood lore or locations that are applicable and
spend some time preparing any required adventures,
maps, and so on. See Designing Adventures, p94.
Improvisation: It is of course impossible to predict every
conceivable player action. Players will come up with ideas
that the Referee has not even considered. Remain flexible
and roll with any unexpected turns the game might take,
rather than trying to force players into a preconceived
course of events. The Dolmenwood core books contain
myriad random tables to provide quick inspiration when
needed. In cases where players venture way beyond
anything the Referee has prepared, it is perfectly fine to
request a short break to consider what lies ahead, or even
to say “is it OK if we explore that next session when I’ve
had time to prepare?”
Lore: The Dolmenwood core books provide a great deal
of detail on the creatures, factions, and places of Dolmenwood. However they are by no means exhaustive. Sooner
or later, players will inquire about something not detailed
in the core books. When this happens, feel free to invent
additional details about Dolmenwood as required.

Neutral Judge
The Referee should remain neutral in all things—neither
on the side of the players nor against them.
Non-competitive: The game is not a competition, with
the players attempting to defeat the Referee, or vice versa.
Consistency: Apply the rules of the game equally to Player
Characters, monsters, and NPCs.

Arbiter of Rules
The Referee decides when and how to apply the rules of
the game.
Narrative focus: Focus first on the narrative description of
situations and actions, before considering the mechanical
or rules aspects. The game’s rules are only general guidelines, and can be overridden by narrative concerns. For
example, a character might discover a hidden pit without a

92

Search Check by pouring water onto the floor and hearing
it trickle down cracks. Judge when to apply the game’s rules
and when to resolve situations purely based on narration.
See also Narrative Interaction under Hazards and Challenges, DPB.
Rulings: The rules of the game—including descriptions
of magic items, spells, and monsters’ special traits—do
not cover all possible eventualities. Apply judgement to
resolve any unexpected situations that arise. See Basic
Game Procedure, DPB for guidance around making rulings
in situations not covered by the rules.
Disagreements: The players may not always agree with the
Referee’s application of the rules. When this happens, the
group should briefly discuss the point of disagreement and
come to a decision. The Referee is always the final arbiter
in such cases and should ensure that the game does not get
bogged down in long discussions about the rules.
Procedures: The rules provide procedures for many
common adventuring situations. These exist in order to
aid the Referee in running the game. However, the Referee
should feel free to skip procedural elements during play,
in order to keep the game moving.
Time-keeping: The passing of time governs many aspects
of the game, from travel and weather to healing and training. The Referee should track the progress of time in the
campaign to ensure that such rules work as intended.

Describing the World

The Referee acts as the PCs’ senses in the world, describing
what they see, hear, smell, and feel. These descriptions
determine the flow of the game.

Player Agency
Only with sufficient information from the Referee can
players make informed decisions.
Clear descriptions: Present everything the PCs can
perceive from their current vantage point, focusing on
creatures, objects, and environmental features they can
meaningfully interact with. It is usually best to present
an overview of a scene then ask players if there’s anything
they’d like more detail on.
Telegraphing danger: While it is important to maintain an
element of mystery and surprise in the game, the Referee
should provide clues to players about potential dangers.
For example, a monster’s dangerous magical powers
might be foreshadowed by PCs coming across the bodies
of former victims. Players who pick up on clues can then
make informed decisions about how to approach the situation, including further investigation or retreat.

Part Thr ee | Running a Campaign

Describing the Unknown
When describing what PCs experience during an adventure, only convey what they can directly perceive.
Creatures: Describe how creatures look, sound, and smell,
rather than referring to them by name. Players will come to
recognise different types of creatures by their descriptions
and behaviours.
Surprise attacks: When characters are attacked by
surprise, simply describe the attack itself, rather than
giving a complete description of the attacker. For example, a character might see a clawed hand reaching out of
the shadows. Only provide a more detailed description of
the foe in subsequent combat Rounds.
Monster and NPC game stats: Players sometimes ask
about the game statistics (e.g. Hit Points, Level, Armour
Class) of creatures encountered. Such information can be
roughly conveyed in a descriptive manner. For example,
“you think the thick, plated hide of the beast might be
equivalent to chainmail” or “after battling the warrior for
a couple of Rounds, you can gauge they’re a more experienced combatant than you, maybe around Level 4 or 5.”
Special items: Describe magic items, special fungi, and
similar, rather than referring to them by name. Only by
experimentation can players discover the properties of
such items.

Describing Areas Being Explored
The usual procedure is for the players to draw maps of
areas being explored, based on the Referee’s descriptions.
Known areas: Sometimes, characters may already know
the shape of an area being explored. For example, an NPC
might have verbally described an area or provided a map.
In this case, the Referee may draw the parts of the map
which are already known.
Dimensions: One way to speed up mapping in dungeons is
to specify the width and length of rooms in terms of map
squares, rather than in feet. The Referee and the players
must agree on the size of one map square.
Complex areas: In the case of extremely complicated
areas, the Referee may draw directly on the players’ map.
This is not generally encouraged, however, as it does not
help players to improve their own mapping skills.

Monsters and NPCs

The Referee is responsible for deciding how monsters and
NPCs react when encountered, but also what schemes and
tactics they follow when the PCs are elsewhere. Monsters
and NPCs have their own instincts, interests, and motivations, just as Player Characters do.

Leaders: May have special capabilities, maximum Hit
Points, or be of higher Level.
Allies: Creatures may have friends, minions, or retainers
of different types nearby. These come to their allies’ aid,
or may avenge them if they are defeated.

Tactics
When deciding how a monster or NPC acts, bear in mind
its level of intelligence. Intelligent creatures might use any
of the following tactics.
Traps and stealth: Creatures that are cunning but not
physically powerful might lay traps or ambushes and
may favour attacking PCs from a distance with missile
weapons.
Guards: Creatures may make use of guards or pets to
weaken PCs or to protect important escape routes.
Magic items: If creatures possess magic items that they
know how to use, they use the items to thwart intruding
PCs.
Learning and preparation: If PCs encounter but do not
defeat creatures, the creatures may learn from the experience and prepare for encountering the PCs again. They
may build defensive structures, call for reinforcements,
relocate their base of operations, and so on.
Adaptation: Creatures may copy or adapt tactics successfully used by PCs and may plan specific counter-manoeuvres.

Character Advancement

It is important that the game remain challenging, even
when Player Characters have reached high Levels and
amassed great wealth and power.
Rate of advancement: The Referee’s placement of enemies
and treasures can strongly determine the rate at which
characters advance in Level. See Rate of Advancement,
p106.
Special powers: Players may sometimes wish to attain
special capabilities and powers beyond those normally
granted by their Class, whether on a temporary or permanent basis. Be careful when allowing this, as it can easily
lead to imbalance. It is recommended to always require a
special quest or adventure in such cases—merely spending
gold does not suffice. For example, PCs may need to quest
to find a magical site, a long-lost artefact, an expert sage,
or a master to learn from.
Excess wealth: If the level of PC wealth has got out of
hand, the Referee may wish to relieve characters of excess
money. This should always present the player with a choice,
for example: pay a local tax or become an outlaw?

Teamwork
When designing encounters, bear in mind that—like Player
Characters—monsters and NPCs join forces in order to
increase their chance of survival.
Combined forces: Creatures with different capabilities
(e.g. those skilled in melee, missile attacks, and magic)
may join forces.

Designing Adventures
Advice on creating adventure sites and drawing PCs towards them.

W

hile Player Characters may choose to wander
aimlessly in search of adventure, the game is
usually driven by adventures designed by the
Referee, tailored to PCs’ actions and aims.

Adventure Scenarios

The first step in designing an adventure is to decide on
the type of scenario. This is the overarching theme that
draws Player Characters to an adventure site and provides
a background that the Referee can use to tie the adventure together. The scenario drives the Referee’s choices of
specific adversaries, treasures, and traps to be placed in
the adventure. The following examples may be used for
inspiration.

Exploring the Unknown
Hearing of a previously unexplored location, PCs set out
to map it and uncover its secrets. The unknown site might
be a dungeon, an obscure wilderness area (e.g. in the Table
Downs or Northern Scratch), or an otherworldly realm (e.g.
in Fairy). It also might sometimes be a known area that has
recently been altered (e.g. a mysterious castle appears by
magic, or a sinister magical force changes the landscape).

Finding a Fabled Site
PCs have a clue to the location of a fabled site and venture
out to find it. The site may, for example, be a standing stone
(p18), a fairy door (p25) or one of the lost shrines of
the Pluritine Church (p22).

Infiltrating an Enemy Faction
PCs must locate and infiltrate an enemy faction’s outpost.
Once there, they must gather intelligence on the enemies’
plans, strengths, and weaknesses, or possibly attempt to
destroy them.

Rescuing Captives
Local people or important NPCs have been kidnapped by
a sinister force such as crookhorns, bandits, or the Drune.
The PCs must attempt to rescue the prisoners, either
seeking a reward or due to a personal connection with the
unfortunate captives.

Seeking Knowledge
PCs must travel to find clues to unravel a mystery that
confronts them. They know of a magical site, ancient
inscription, or sagacious NPC that allegedly has the knowledge they seek.

94

Seeking Magical Aid
PCs require magical aid to remove a curse, revive the dead,
gain insight into the future, or similar. They have a clue to
the whereabouts of a magical site, special fungus or herb,
magic item, or NPC with the required power, and must
travel through the wilds to locate it.

Seeking Treasure
PCs learn of the reputed site of some treasure and venture
out to claim it. As XP is awarded primarily for treasure recovered, this is the most fundamental adventure
scenario.

Vanquishing Evil
An evil presence (e.g. a monster or NPC) must be banished
or destroyed. It may have migrated to a location where it
threatens a local settlement, or it may have lain dormant
for years and have been recently awakened (perhaps as a
result of another party’s meddling).

Part Thr ee | Running a Campaign

Adventure Sites

After deciding on the basic scenario of the adventure, it’s
time to design the site at which the adventure takes place.
Most adventures take place in one of the following types
of sites.
Dungeon: A ruined, subterranean, or indoor space. See
Designing Dungeons, p96.
Wilderness: An outdoor location in a specific hex on the
campaign map.
Settlement: One or more locations within a settlement.
Indoor locations may be designed as dungeons (p96).

Prepare Situations, Not Plots
It can be tempting to plot out elaborate storylines,
where antagonists and PCs interact in a series of predetermined or branching steps. However, this approach
tends to result in rigid scenarios that fall apart as soon
as players decide on an unforeseen course of action.
Much of the Referee’s prep work is wasted.
Instead, spend prep time detailing the locations,
puzzles, monsters, NPCs, and treasures involved in
the adventure. The story and the means by which PCs
transition from one part of the adventure to the next
emerge during play, rather than being pre-plotted.

Location
Decide which hex the adventuring site is located in. Some
factors to consider:
Base town: Game sessions often begin in a settlement,
where the PCs returned to rest following their previous
adventure. Consider the distance from this settlement
to the adventure site. Adventures at distant sites entail
extensive travel through the wilds, increasing the duration
and complexity of the adventure.
Beginning characters: For Level 1 characters, it is recommended to place adventures close to a settlement, obviating the need for extensive (and potentially dangerous)
overland travel. For a party’s first adventure, play may
optionally start directly at the adventure location (e.g. at
the entrance to a dungeon), getting players directly into
the action.
Uncertainty: Sometimes the location of the adventure site
may be a matter of conjecture. PCs may be working from
rumours, old maps, or hearsay. Simply locating the site
may be an adventure in itself.

Backstory
Consider what led the site to cease being a normal place and
become an adventure locale where monsters can be battled
and treasures found. For example, it may be a ruin of a past

civilisation (mortal or fairy), a place twisted by weird magic
(e.g. ley energies, Atanuwë), or a site abandoned following
a disaster (e.g. fire, war, fungal infestation).
Players may discover the site’s backstory during play, or it
may simply aid in conjuring a sense of flavour and cohesion in the place.

Hooks and Rumours

Once the adventure scenario has been determined and the
adventure site detailed, consider how PCs may get involved
in the adventure.
Hooks: Hooks are means of directly involving PCs in an
adventure. They may be hired to complete a mission, sent
on a quest by a mentor, drawn to an adventure by dreams
or visions, seek a bounty offered for completion of a task,
find a map or documents leading to the adventure site, or
be present at the scene of a crime.
Rumours: In addition to direct hooks, it can be fun to
create a list of rumours that PCs might hear about the
adventure site or creatures or treasures that might be
encountered there. Not all rumours are true, however.
Some may contain partial truths, misleading misconceptions, or outright falsehoods.

Barrow mound: Ancient tombs beneath one or more
raised mounds.
Burrow: Tunnels and chambers dug out by burrowing
animals, worms, or insects.
Camp: A complex of tents and pavilions, either nomadic,
semi-permanent, or erected for a specific purpose.
Caverns: Naturally occurring tunnels and caves, formed
by water erosion of rock.
Church (ruined): A ruined chapel, church, or shrine.
Crypt complex: Abandoned graveyards, mausoleums, and
underground crypts.
Dwelling: A cottage, manor, or inn (active or ruined).
Giant creature: Inside the body, corpse, or skeleton of a
gargantuan humanoid or animal.
Giant mushroom: Carved in the flesh or in underground
spaces created by the mycelia.
Giant tree: Carved in the trunk or in underground spaces
created by the roots.
Hamlet: An isolated cluster of dwellings (active or ruined).
Magical space: An isolated pocket of Fairy, an extra-dimensional space in a ley line, the interior of a magical sack.

96

Thicket: Tunnels and chambers within a mass of tangled
trees, brambles, moss, or fungal matter.
Tower or keep: A stone fortification (active or ruined).
Tunnels: Mine shafts or tunnels delved underground.
Vessel: A grounded ship, a giant teapot or cauldron.
Watercourse: Passages and chambers around an underground watercourse, some with air pockets, some
completely submerged.

Unusual Locales
Most dungeons are located either underground or on the
surface. Some other possibilities are dungeons underwater, floating in the air, or suspended in the treetops.

2. Choose Denizens

Based on the selected adventure scenario and dungeon
form, decide what types of creatures inhabit the dungeon.
You can use creatures from the Dolmenwood Monster Book
(possibly tailored to suit the location) or devise new ones.
See Dungeon Denizens, p98 for more suggestions.

3. Map the Dungeon

On a sheet of graph paper (or dungeon mapping software),
sketch out the basic shape of the dungeon, with rooms or
open areas connected by doors, passages, stairs, and so
forth.
Structure: The dungeon’s form (see step 1) usually determines its overall structure and size—e.g. rough caverns
and winding passages, separate tombs or dwellings, or
carefully laid-out defensive structures
Numbering: Give each room or significant area of the
dungeon a number.
Levels: If the dungeon has multiple levels, make a separate map for each, noting stairs, pits, trapdoors, and other
means of moving between levels.
Scale: Dungeon maps are typically drawn with a scale of
5′ or 10′ per square, depending on the size of the site and
the rooms.
Symbols: See Common Dungeon Mapping Symbols for
some basic symbols used in dungeon maps.
Variety: Varied environments and non-linear routes
through the dungeon provide ground for fun exploration
and tactics. Some ideas: multiple entrances (some hidden),
multiple routes to major areas and between levels, secret
areas, unusual passages (pipes, well shafts, submerged
tunnels, etc.), loops, shafts or tall rooms spanning levels,
balconies, chasms, bridges.

Part Thr ee | Running a Campaign

4. Stock the Dungeon

Make notes describing each numbered area on the map.
This is called stocking the dungeon. Begin by placing creatures, treasures, and features that play an important role
in the adventure, then detail areas of less importance.
Layout: Consider how different parts of the dungeon are
used by its denizens and place features appropriately. For
example, intelligent creatures may place guard posts,
barricades, or traps along paths leading to their main lair.
Empty rooms: Every single area need not be crammed full
of creatures, traps, and treasure. Quiet, uninhabited areas
help to build tension and provide opportunities for stealth,
ambushes, and rest. In larger dungeons (20+ areas), it is
recommended that roughly one-third of rooms be empty.

Area Descriptions
Write some simple notes on the contents of each numbered
area. There is no need to write full paragraphs of descriptive text—rough notes to jog the memory usually suffice.
Primary details: For each area, note any creatures that are
present, along with any environmental features, hazards,
traps, tricks, treasures, mysteries, or special magical effects
that are present. See Dungeon Environment, p100, Traps,
p102, Secret Doors, p104, and Tricks and Weirdness,
p105 for more ideas.
Secondary details: Note additional descriptive details for
each area: furnishings, everyday items, smells, sounds,
lights, etc.
Adjacent areas: Note sounds, light, or smells emanating
from adjacent areas (if any). Such details give players clues
as to what they may encounter next.

Random Room Stocking (Optional)
The following table may help when stocking dungeon
areas.

Dungeon Denizens
Creatures that lurk in dark, ruined places.

A

dungeon’s flavour is strongly impacted by the
denizens the referee selects. Each type of creature—from shambling undead or fungal horrors
to crafty bandits or tricksome fairies—presents its own
challenges and atmosphere for players to encounter.

Placing Denizens

For each level of the dungeon, select thematically appropriate creatures of the same Level. Generally speaking, Level 1
creatures inhabit a dungeon’s first level, Level 2 creatures
its second level, and so on.
Higher Level creatures: The referee can place creatures of
a higher Level in reduced numbers. For example, madtoms
(Level 2 monsters—DMB) are usually encountered in
groups of 1d12. If placed on the first level of a dungeon,
this might be reduced to 1d6.
Lower Level creatures: Similarly, creatures of lower Level
may appear in greater numbers.

Factions
Each type of creature or social grouping forms a faction in
the dungeon. For small dungeons (up to around 20 areas),
1–3 main factions are sufficient. Larger dungeons often
find multiple factions living alongside one another and
interacting in various ways. For each faction, consider the
following.
Dungeon usage: Why is the faction in the dungeon? It
may be simply living there, or may be hiding, performing
rituals, rearing young, visiting a magical site, etc.
Areas and paths: Which areas of the dungeon does the
faction occupy? Does it regularly use any paths leading into
other regions of the dungeon or out of the dungeon? Does
it maintain patrols in any areas of the dungeon?

Example: The Referee is designing a dungeon hidden behind
a waterfall, where a band of crookhorn brigands lair. Consulting the crookhorn entry in the DMB, the Referee notes that
they are encountered in groups of 3d10 individuals. The DMB
Monster Statistics section states that up to 5 times as many
individuals may be encountered in monster lairs (i.e. typically
up to 15d10 crookhorns). Deciding this is a relatively small lair,
the Referee rolls 8d10, resulting in 33 individuals in the lair. The
Referee decides to place 4 guarding the entrance, 8 lounging
in a foetid feasting chamber, 12 sleeping in a set of three rank
bunk rooms, and the leader and two lieutenants scheming and
gloating over the group’s hoard in a secluded chamber with 6
guards posted outside.

Wandering Monsters

In addition to creatures placed in specific areas of a
dungeon, an encounter table provides creatures that might
be encountered on the move between areas. Wandering
monsters enhance the feeling that the dungeon is an
active, living environment, and serve the important function of keeping players on their toes as they explore.
Encounter tables: Create an encounter table for each level
of the dungeon, tailored to its form and denizens, or use
the generic encounter tables opposite.
When to roll for wandering monsters: Roll a check for
wandering monsters once every 2 Turns, with a 1-in-6
chance of an encounter occurring. At the Referee’s discretion, some dungeons or areas may have higher or lower
chances of wandering monsters. See Wandering Monsters
under Hazards and Challenges, DPB.
Encounter procedure: See Rolling an Encounter for a
summary of the steps to follow when a wandering monster
is encountered.

Reaction to PCs: How does the faction react to the presence
of adventurers? For example, defensive actions, offers of
trade, or outright hostility. A faction’s reaction to PCs can
also be left open, to be determined by a Reaction Roll in
play (see Encounters, DPB).
Relationships: What is the faction’s relationship with
other factions? For example, rivalries, enmities, truces,
or trade relationships.

Lairs
Dungeon denizens of a particular type or faction often
occupy multiple rooms of a dungeon. When placing a
large group of creatures, the total number of individuals
in the lair may be divided between a number of areas of
the dungeon. The creatures’ shared hoard (as indicated in
the monster listing) should likewise be divided between
multiple areas or located in one central treasure room.

98

Restocking
If PCs leave a dungeon and then return at a later
date, consider whether anything has changed in the
intervening time. For example, scavengers may have
devoured slain monsters or adventurers, new creatures
may have moved into areas PCs cleared, and traps may
have been reset. Intelligent denizens may increase
patrols, call for reinforcements, revise tactics, or even
move their base of operations in response to PC intrusions. In this way, the dungeon feels like a dynamic,
living environment.

Dungeon Environment
Fungi, slimes, moulds, plants, and the weird illogic of the underworld.

E

xtensive subterranean dungeons often form an
ecosystem of their own, rife with weird fungi and
plants and deadly slimes and moulds. This section
details some of the most common hazardous and beneficial species, along with a general discussion on the bizarre
environment of realms beneath the surface.

Fungi

Having no need of light, fungi of many kinds thrive underground. The Common Dungeon Fungi table lists some
species of edible and special fungi that adventurers may
find underground.

Many dungeons beneath Dolmenwood’s surface stray into
regions of subterranean weirdness. The everyday logic of
the surface world recedes and dream logic and perplexing
mystery take over. It may be that pulsating ley energies
or slumbering subterranean godlings disrupt the laws of
nature that govern life on the surface. Whatever the cause,
the deeps of the world are rife with weird monsters, mysterious secrets, and otherworldly magic.

While some subterranean dungeons operate according to
the normal laws of logic and ecology, this does not always
have to be the case. When designing dungeons, the Referee
should let their imagination run wild, populating the
Underworld with bizarre and wondrous environments,
puzzles, encounters, monsters, and treasures. Such delves
offer an exciting change of pace, compared with the more
naturalistic adventures of the surface. See Tricks and
Weirdness, p105 for some ideas.

Special fungi: See Rare Fungi, p428.

Dungeon Adversity (Optional)
Some regions of the Underworld have a sentience of their
own, actively resisting the intrusion of adventurers from
the surface world. The following ideas emphasise this
adversarial aspect of the Underworld.
Stuck doors: Most dungeon doors resist being opened by
adventurers—treat them as being stuck (see Doors under
Hazards and Challenges, DPB). The dungeon allows its own
denizens to pass freely, however.
Doors closing: Unless wedged open (e.g. using iron spikes),
dungeon doors surreptitiously close after PCs have passed.
Darkness: All dungeon denizens can see normally in the
dark, whether this is mentioned in their stat block or not.
Adventurers must bring their own light sources to fathom
the deeps.
Lights: The dungeon resists the presence of light sources,
incurring a chance (e.g. 1-in-6 per Turn) of torches and
lanterns sputtering out, unexpectedly dropping characters into utter blackness.

100

Plants

While the roots of great trees often intrude into dungeons
close to the surface, normal woodland plants cannot
survive underground. Some plants of a magical nature
thrive underground, feeding on veins of magical energy
in lieu of sunlight. The Dungeon Plants table lists some
species of magical plants that adventurers may come
across in their delvings.

Moulds

Slimes

Triggering: If touched or damaged, there is a 3-in-6 chance
of the mould emitting a cloud of spores in a 10′ cube area.

Triggering: When a character passes beneath, there is a
2-in-6 chance of the slime dropping down on their head.

Effect: All in the cloud must Save Versus Blast or be caught
in the spores. The effect depends on the type of mould.

Effect: The character must Save Versus Blast or be coated
in the slime, suffering damage. The type of damage and
other effects depend on the type of slime.

Patches of fungal fuzz that cover walls and ceilings.

Removing: Each type of mould is harmed by a specific
type of damage. Each roughly 10′ × 10′ patch of mould can
withstand 2d8 points of damage.

Common Mould Types
1. Beige mould: Inflicts 2d6 cold damage per Round to any
in the cloud, which lingers for 1d6 Rounds. Beige mould
patches spread in the presence of fire within 5′: a torch
causes the mould to double in size, burning oil quadruple,
and a Fireball 8 times. Multiplication takes 1 Round. Beige
mould is harmed by magical cold.
2. Cyan mould: Infests victims’ skin with spores, manifesting as cyan patches the next day. If not cured (e.g. the
holy Cure Affliction spell), the victim dies after seven days,
as the mould overruns the entire body. Cyan mould is
harmed by fire or acid.
3. Ochre mould: Causes choking for 6 Rounds, inflicting
1d6 damage per Round. Ochre mould is harmed by fire.
4. Violet mould: Desiccates characters’ internals, causing
a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws until a pint
of water is consumed. Death by dehydration occurs after
4 hours, if no water is available. Violet mould explodes
if touched with fire, inflicting 2d4 damage to all within
10′ (Save Versus Blast for half damage). Violet mould is
harmed by acid or water (1d6 damage per pint).

Dripping sheets of slime that cling to ceilings.

Armour: Light armour prevents damage for 1 Round, after
which it is dissolved. Medium armour dissolves after 2
Rounds, and Heavy armour after 3 Rounds.
Removing: Slimes can only be removed by fire, which
inflicts half damage to the victim and half to the slime.
Each slime can withstand 2d8 points of damage.

Common Slime Types
1. Clear slime: Freezing, inflicts 1d4 damage per Round. A
character killed is frozen solid.
2. Green slime: Acidic, inflicts 1d6 damage per Round. A
character killed is dissolved to sludge.
3. Mauve slime: Causes flesh to puff, bubble, and dissolve,
inflicting 1d3 damage per Round. A character killed is
reduced to a mauve-tinged skeleton which reanimates as a
Chaotic undead monster after 1d6 Turns (skeleton—DMB).
4. Onyx slime: Burning, inflicts 1 damage per Round. If the
character has any magic items on their person, there is a
2-in-6 chance per Round of an item exploding, causing an
additional 1d4 damage (and destroying the item). A character killed becomes a charred corpse.

Traps
Dastardly contraptions to thwart the intrusions of meddling adventurers.

F

rom the humble pit, to the cunningly hidden
poisoned needle, to magical wards and enchantments, traps play a fundamental role in the
dungeon. This section discusses some of the most common
types of traps. For more details on finding and disarming
traps, see Traps under Hazards and Challenges, DPB.

Triggers and Effects

All traps have a trigger (the action that sets off the trap) and
an effect (what happens when the trap is triggered). With a
pit trap, the trigger and effect are combined—a character
steps on the pit and falls in. For other traps, possible triggers and effects are discussed separately.

Exploration and Clues

A party moving at exploration speed (see Time and Movement, DPB) is assumed to be carefully inspecting the environment for hazards. The Referee may give the players
clues as to the presence of traps, drawing their attention
to features that warrant further investigation. The various
trap effects and triggers discussed here list some example
clues that the Referee may provide to players.

Pit Traps

Pit traps are simply holes in the floor, usually 10′ across and
10′–20′ deep, that harm and trap the victim (1d6 damage per
10′ depth, aid or climbing tools needed to escape).
Disarming and bypassing: Pits can be jumped or bridged
(e.g. with planks or ladders). Sometimes a ledge allows
passage around the rim.

Pit Types
Open pit: The pit is not concealed in any way. Its presence
is obvious to any approaching it.
Covered pit: The pit is covered with cloth or branches and
disguised with debris. Anyone stepping on the pit falls in.
Clues: Sagging floor. Ropes or pegs anchoring the cover.
Hinged pit: The pit is covered with a hinged section of
normal floor. Anyone stepping on the hinged section
causes it to swing open, dropping them in the pit. If
detected, the hinged floor can be wedged shut (or open)
using iron spikes. Clues: Angled floor. Creaking hinges.
Locking pit: Functions the same as a hinged pit, but the
hinged floor springs shut, trapping characters in the pit.
A Strength Check can force the lid open.
Pit base hazards: The pit may be lined with spikes (inflicting 1d6 additional damage), filled with water (carrying a
risk of drowning), filled with acid (1d6 damage per Round),
or inhabited by a ravenous monster. Clues: Odour of dank
water or chemicals. Muffled monster sounds.

102

Architectural Traps

Architectural traps are based on large-scale mechanisms of
hinges, cogs, pulleys, and springs hidden inside dungeon
floors, walls, and ceilings.
Disarming and bypassing: Architectural traps can usually
only be disarmed or bypassed by narrative interaction
with the trap’s trigger or effect. See Narrative Interaction
under Hazards and Challenges, DPB.

Triggers
Pressure plate: Weight on a section of floor triggers the
trap. Characters can bypass the trap by jumping over or
moving around the pressure plate. The plate may also
be jammed with iron spikes, or by leaving a weight on it.
Clues: Slightly raised, lowered, or uneven floor.
Scales: Removing an object (e.g. a treasure) from its place
of rest triggers the trap. A successful Legerdemain Check
allows a bard or thief to bypass the trap by switching out
the object with another of similar weight. Clues: Object
rests on an obvious plate. Object precisely placed.
Tripwire: Pulling a wire stretched between two walls or
pillars triggers the trap. Characters who are aware of a tripwire can bypass it simply by stepping over it. An unaware
character has a 4-in-6 chance of triggering the trap when
passing. Clues: Glinting wire. Suspended cobwebs.

Magical Traps

Magical traps may be placed on any area or object by someone with appropriate spells or other magical capabilities.
Disarming and bypassing: Magical traps can usually
only be disarmed or bypassed by magic (e.g. Dispel Magic).
Sometimes a password might grant safe passage.
Clues: The presence of a magical trap is sometimes hinted
at by glowing energy, odd statues or murals, runes,
symbols, or arcane inscriptions.

Triggers
Detection: The presence of a certain type of person or
object triggers the trap. A magical trap could detect any
quality imaginable, for example character Alignment,
faction affiliation, religion, etc.
Proximity: Movement of any kind in a certain area triggers the trap.
Speech: Speech (or sound) in a certain area triggers the
trap. The magic may also distinguish specific languages
or words.
Touch: Touching a certain object triggers the trap.

Part Thr ee | Running a Campaign

Mechanism Traps

Mechanism traps are based on complex, clockwork-like
mechanisms hidden inside locks, lids, and door handles.
Disarming and bypassing: Thieves’ tools and a successful
Disarm Mechanism Check allows a thief to disable or deactivate a mechanism trap. Other characters do not have the
requisite expertise. Mechanism traps sometimes feature
a hidden button to temporarily disable the mechanism.
Destroying: If characters suspect the presence of a mechanism trap, simply smashing the mechanism is sometimes
effective in disabling the trap. The Referee must judge in
each case whether this successfully disables the trap or
causes it to trigger.
Clues: Mechanism traps sometimes have unusual
construction or bulk around the trigger.

Triggers
Lock: Turning a lock with the wrong key triggers the trap.
Opening mechanism: Opening a latch, lid, or handle triggers the trap.

Trap Effects

When triggered, a mechanism, architectural, or magical
trap may have any number of effects. Some common trap
effects are described below, but feel free to invent others.
1. Alarm: A loud noise blares, attracting nearby creatures
or triggering a wandering monster check. Clues: Visible
bell or horn. Statue with gaping mouth.
2. Collapsing ceiling: All in a 10′ square area must Save
Versus Blast or be hit by rubble (1d10 damage). Depending
on the severity of the collapse, the area may be blocked.
Clues: Cracks on the ceiling. Rubble and dust on the floor.
3. Crushing walls or ceiling: The walls or ceiling of the
room crush inwards, killing characters who do not escape
within 3 Rounds. This effect is often combined with a dropping portcullis. Clues: Tracks along walls. Crushed bones.
4. Darts or arrows: One or more small missiles fire from
holes. For each missile, make an Attack Roll (Attack +2)
against the triggering character. Arrows inflict 1d6 damage.
Darts inflict no damage but are poisoned: Save Versus
Doom or suffer 1d6 damage for 6 Rounds. Clues: Small
holes in wall. Impact marks on opposite wall.
5. Deafening noise: Characters within 20′ must Save
Versus Doom or be deafened for 1d6 Turns. Clues:
Container of explosive powder. Chemical odour.
6. Dropping portcullis: A portcullis falls, blocking
a passage (often characters’ exit). Characters with a
combined Strength of 40 or more can lift the portcullis.
Clues: Channels in the walls. A slot in the ceiling.
7. Fire blast: A gout of flame shoots out from a wall or
statue. All in a line 5′ wide and 20′ long must Save Versus
Blast or suffer 2d4 damage. Clues: Small hole where flame
emanates. Charred stone. Odour of oil or chemicals.
8. Flashing light: A blinding light flashes. All within 10′
must Save Versus Doom or be blinded for 1d8 Turns. Clues:
Container of flare powder. Chemical odour. Crystal globe.

9. Illusion: An illusion of a monster appears and attacks
the triggering character. It has AC 10 and disappears if hit.
The monster’s attacks appear to inflict damage, but no real
damage is ever inflicted. A character killed by the illusion
actually falls unconscious for 1d4 Turns. Clues: Crystal
prism. Murals depicting the monster.
10. Mantrap: Hidden metal jaws snap around the triggering character’s foot. Make an Attack Roll (Attack +2)
against the triggering character. If the attack succeeds,
the character suffers 1d3 damage and is unable to move.
Characters with a combined Strength of 20 or more can
free the victim. Clues: Rubble concealing the mantrap.
Holes in floor. Blood stains.
11. Monster release: A locked or hidden door opens, releasing dangerous creatures. Clues: Muffled monster sounds.
Monster scent. Claw marks on walls.
12. Net: Characters in a 10′ square area must Save Versus
Hold or be yanked upwards, trapped and suspended in a
net. With a bladed weapon, a trapped character may make
a Dexterity Check each Round to escape. Clues: Rubble
disguising the net. Ropes along walls.
13. Poison gas: A cloud of gas fills a 10′ cube. Anyone in
the gas must Save Versus Doom or be affected. Poison gas
commonly causes victims to fall unconscious for 1d6 Turns
or inflicts 1d6 damage for 6 Rounds. Clues: Chemical odour.
Area free of lichen, mould, etc.
14. Poison needle: A small needle jabs the triggering character. Make an Attack Roll (Attack +4) against the triggering
character. If the attack succeeds, the character must Save
Versus Doom or die in 1d6 Rounds. Clues: Pinhole.
15. Rolling boulder: A spherical boulder drops from the
ceiling and rolls in a specific direction with Speed 30. Any
character it passes must Save Versus Blast or suffer 6d6
damage. Clues: Sloped floor. Outline of trapdoor.
16. Scything blade: A blade springs out from a wall. Make
an Attack Roll (Attack +2) against the triggering character.
The blade inflicts 1d8 damage. Clues: Slot in wall. Blood
stains.
17. Snare: The triggering character must Save Versus Hold
or be yanked upwards and suspended in a snare. With a
bladed weapon, the trapped character may make a Dexterity Check each Round to escape. Clues: Rubble disguising
the snare. Ropes along walls.
18. Spikes: Spikes spring out from a wall. Make an Attack
Roll (Attack +4) against the triggering character. The spikes
inflicts 2d6 damage. Clues: Holes in wall. Blood stains.
19. Spray: A liquid sprays out. All in a line 5′ wide and 10′
long must Save Versus Blast or be covered. Sprays are
commonly either acid (2d4 damage) or coat characters in
a monster attracting scent (chance of wandering monsters
is doubled for 1d6 hours). Clues: Chemical odour. Spray
marks on walls.
20. Water filling: Doors close and lock tight, as water pours
from the ceiling. After 6 Rounds, the room is submerged,
drowning any who cannot breathe underwater (see Suffocation under Hazards and Challenges, DPB). Clues: Holes
in ceiling. Watertight surroundings.

Secret Doors
Cunningly hidden portals leading to secret dungeon areas.

D

oors hidden from plain sight—concealing treasures, profane shrines, arcane mysteries, or secret
exits—are a classic element of dungeon design.
While secret doors are not essential in all dungeons,
their potential presence adds an element of mystery to
a dungeon. For more details on finding secret doors, see
Doors under Hazards and Challenges, DPB.

Types of Secret Doors
There are broadly three types of secret doors:

1. Hidden doors: Some secret doors are hidden from sight
and must be located by searching or by narrative interaction. The Secret Doors table provides some ideas.
2. Hidden opening mechanisms: Some secret doors are
plain to see but can only be opened by a mechanism
hidden nearby, either mechanical or magical in nature.
The Mechanical Opening Mechanisms and Magical
Opening Mechanisms tables provide some ideas.
3. Doubly hidden doors: Sometimes characters must
locate a hidden door and a hidden opening mechanism.
Other door types: Secret doors need not always be humansized portals in a wall. Secret portals of many other kinds
are possible—for example, trapdoors (in ceilings or floors),
hatches, spyholes, pipes, and closets.

Clues

The Referee may sometimes give the players clues about
secret doors and how to open them.
Visual: There may be scuff marks on the floor, footprint
trails leading to the door, faintly audible sounds beyond
the door, stains or roots crossing the threshold, and so on.
Functional: The presence of guards or patrols suggest the
presence of a secret door.
Symbolic: Inscriptions, murals, or statues in the vicinity
(or elsewhere in the dungeon) may hint at the means of
opening a door.

Tricks and Weirdness
Dungeon oddities to befuddle and vex adventurers.

T

ricks, puzzles, riddles, and magical weirdness
can add mystery and excitement to a dungeon,
challenging players’ creativity and imagination.
Some of the most common forms of tricks are discussed
here. Use these to spark the imagination in creating unique
new puzzles and mysteries.

Architectural Tricks

Shifting walls: After the party (or half the party) passes,
a wall slides in place to block retreat. It shifts back after
some time.
Shifting rooms: Rooms may spin, rise, or drop when PCs
enter, disorienting the party or taking them to a different
dungeon level.
Trick doors: One-way doors and false doors are common
tricks to control adventurers’ paths through the dungeon.
Magical doors may lead to two or more different locations
depending on the circumstances (e.g. position of a lever or
speaking a command word).

Illusory Features

Illusory walls: A door or passageway may be concealed
with an illusion of a blank wall, revealed by touch.
Invisible walls: An invisible portcullis or section of wall
may trick PCs into thinking an exit is available.
Illusory floors: A pit or chasm may be concealed with an
illusory bridge or section of floor.

Teleports

Entrances: Magical doorways, energy vortices, planes of
light, mirror surfaces, or floor pads that PCs can step into
and emerge in another location. Teleports may be plain
to see, invisible, or hidden (e.g. a magic circle under a rug).
Destinations: Characters may be transported to another
place in the dungeon, to a place elsewhere in Dolmenwood,
to a fairy road, or even into Fairy or some other magical
dimension. The Referee should, of course, develop the
details of the destination ahead of time.
Returning: Characters may be able to return by stepping
back through a portal or by using a return teleporter, or
travel may be one-directional.

Riddles and Clues

Riddles: Inscriptions, dungeon denizens, or speaking statues may pose riddles. Riddles sometimes refer to information found elsewhere in the dungeon, encouraging
thorough exploration. If players can answer the riddle,
they are usually rewarded—e.g. safe passage, opening a
locked door, or revelation of a secret or treasure.
Clues: The Referee can offer hints to important traps,
tricks, and puzzles with clues elsewhere in the dungeon,
rewarding players with an eye for detail. For example,
murals and statues can depict visual clues, riddles and
codes can provide written clues, and so forth.

Magical Weirdness

An infinite variety of other magical tricks and oddities
is possible. The following tables present some ideas for
magical qualities of dungeon features. The Referee may use
these tables to inspire all manner of odd magical locations,
fleshed out with ideas from their own imagination.

Awarding XP
How characters advance following a successful adventure.

T

he Dolmenwood Player’s Book describes the basics
of how characters earn XP for successful adventuring (see Advancement, DPB). This section
describes the process of awarding XP in greater detail,
along with optional rules for different kinds of XP awards.

When to Award XP

XP is awarded to the party following an adventure, upon
their return to safety. The Referee may decide what constitutes a safe place, as befits the campaign. For example, XP
may only be awarded when PCs return to their home base,
or it may be awarded upon arriving at a wayside inn, or
even upon safely emerging from a dungeon.

Standard XP Awards
XP For Treasure Recovered
Treasure that PCs bring back from an adventure is the
primary means by which they gain XP, usually accounting for three-quarters or more of the total XP earned. The
game is designed this way—with treasure as the primary
source of XP—to encourage varied play and reward all
types of characters equally. For example, violence, stealth,
trickery, magic, and diplomacy are all equally valid means
of acquiring treasure.
Awards: The party gains 1 XP per 1 gold piece value of
treasure, including coins, gems, jewellery, and art objects.
Items that grant special powers (e.g. magic items, special
fungi / herbs, and similar) do not usually grant XP—their
wondrous powers are their own reward to adventurers.
Recovered treasure and rewards: Usually only treasure
recovered from dangerous adventure sites (e.g. monster
lairs, enemy camps, dungeons, etc.) or granted as a reward
for completing a quest qualifies for XP awards.
Other wealth: The Referee should decide whether wealth
acquired by other means (e.g. stolen in towns, gained by
selling used items, earned through business ventures, etc.)
qualifies for XP awards.

Rate of Advancement
Each group has its own preferences as to how quickly
characters advance in Level. The Referee should discuss
expectations with the players. Typically, at least one PC
should reach Level 2 after 10–15 hours of play. If this has
not happened, the Referee may consider increasing the
rate of advancement. If, on the other hand, most PCs
have reached Level 3 in this time-frame, the Referee
may consider slowing the rate of advancement.
XP multiplier: To speed up or slow down advancement,
calculate XP awards as normal, then apply a multiplier
(e.g. doubling or halving calculated XP awards).
Treasure placement: If using the standard XP For
Treasure rule, the Referee can control the rate of
advancement by adjusting the amount of treasure
placed in adventures.
Danger: When adjusting the rate of advancement, also
bear in mind the risk level of the game. Some groups
prefer a game with high risk and high reward, leading to
quick advancement for characters who survive. Other
groups prefer the game to focus on character development, with slow advancement and low danger.

New Player Characters
Sometimes a new PC joins an adventuring party, for
example when a previous PC dies. Per the standard
rules (Creating a Character, DPB), new PCs begin play
with 0 XP. Groups wishing for the new PC to catch up
with others more quickly may optionally allow new PCs
to start with half the XP of the old PC (or of the group’s
average XP). This will, on average, place the new PC one
Level below other characters.

Optional XP Awards

The Referee may use any of the following options in addition to or instead of the standard awards described previously (XP for treasure recovered and defeating foes).

XP For Defeating Foes

XP For Magic and Special Items

Foes defeated during the course of an adventure also grant
XP. This includes creatures slain, as well as those that fled
from combat or surrendered. The Referee may optionally
also grant XP for creatures tricked or outsmarted by the
party in a clever way.

Referees wishing to increase the rate of advancement may
also grant XP for magic items, special herbs / fungi, and
similar items gained by adventuring.
Awards: The party gains XP equal to one-fifth of the gold
piece value of magic and special items.

Awards: The party gains the XP award listed in the stat
block of each creature defeated.

Selling items: If characters sell a magic or special item
without using it, they may be awarded XP equal to the
sale value in gold pieces. If the party has already used its
powers, they do not gain XP from the proceeds of the sale.
See Magic Items, p396 for further guidelines on selling
magic items.

Foes: XP is usually only awarded for defeating creatures
that posed a threat during an adventure. Unprovoked
attacks on villagers and farm animals do not earn XP.

XP For Milestones

XP For Exploration

In campaigns focused on an overarching plot or theme
(see p90), adventures are often based around story
milestones, rather than the search for treasure. In such
cases, award XP when characters achieve a certain goal or
milestone (as judged by the Referee).

Referees wishing to encourage exploration of Dolmenwood and its mysteries may award XP for a variety of
exploration goals.

Awards: Milestone XP awards are determined by the average Level of characters in the party (with fractions rounded
down) and whether a major or minor milestone has been
achieved. See the Milestone Awards table. Each character
in the party receives the listed milestone award.
Milestones: The Referee must determine what constitutes
a major or minor milestone, based on the party’s goals and
the current adventure plot.
Example: A party of 5 characters—a Level 5 magician, a Level
2 thief, and three Level 4 knights—has achieved a minor milestone. The party’s average Level is 3, calculated as (5 + 2 + 4 + 4 +
4) / 5, rounded down. The milestone award for each character
in the party is thus 1,000 XP.

Awards: A deed award for the party’s average Level (see
the Milestone Awards table). Each character in the party
receives the award.
Exploration goals: Some example exploration goals are
listed below. The Referee may invent others as desired.
▶ Visiting a settlement for the first time.
▶ Entering a hex for the first time (optionally excluding
hexes simply travelled through by road).
▶ Finding a lost shrine.
▶ Finding a nodal stone.
▶ Discovering a hidden location.
▶ Meeting a faction or type of creature for the first time.
▶ Confirming the veracity of a rumour.

XP For Great Deeds
The Referee may optionally award extra XP to individual
characters who excelled in an adventure (e.g. single handedly defeated dangerous foes, saved the day with clever
tactics, etc.).
Awards: A deed award for the character’s Level (see the
Milestone Awards table), or as the Referee wishes.

XP For Spending Treasure
Referees wishing to encourage characters to spend treasure acquired on adventures may award XP for treasure
spent (in addition to or instead of treasure recovered).
Awarding XP for both acquiring and spending treasure
significantly increases the rate of character advancement.
Awards: Individual characters gain 1 XP per 1 gold piece
they spend on non-trivial expenditures.
Non-trivial expenditures: The Referee should judge what
kinds of expenditures qualify for XP awards. Philanthropic
projects that do not directly benefit the character are a
good example. Daily living expenses and buying items to
be used on adventures typically do not qualify.
Carousing: Referees wishing to foster a picaresque tone
of hard-living, hard-drinking adventurers may decide to
grant XP for money frittered away on elaborate parties,
feasts, and celebrations.

Be careful of the songs you sing
If fairies hear your wandering song

Your paths grow twisty, strange, and long

Rain, and sun, and snow, and rain
Step off the path, don’t come home again”

Seasons and Unseasons
The turning of the year’s wheel and how the climate of the Wood fluctuates.

T

he calendar used in Dolmenwood is described
in the Dolmenwood Player’s Book. This section
further details the turning of the seasons in
Dolmenwood, including the weird, magical environmental conditions—known as unseasons—that occasionally
take hold.

Winter

The months of Grimvold, Lymewald, and Haggryme. In
ancient days, Dolmenwood fell within the dominion of the
Cold Prince, and was clad in ice all year round. Since the
vanquishing of the Cold Prince, winter’s hold over Dolmenwood is light. The waters of the Wood seldom freeze and
the fecund growth of moss and fern forms a gentle blanket
that fends off the worst of the cold. Snowfall is common
in the months of Lymewald and Haggryme, but it seldom
piles deep.

Spring

The months of Symswald, Harchment, and Iggwyld.
Dolmenwood is widely regarded as most beautiful in the
springtime. The cold, dark nights of winter withdraw, and
the carpets of soft, sparkling snow melt away to reveal
dainty flowers. Spring in Dolmenwood is sunny and clement, and animals and people alike skip gaily through the
glades of the Wood.

Summer

The months of Chysting, Lillipythe, and Haelhold.
Dolmenwood is hot and humid in the summertime, abuzz
with foraging and biting insects. A syrupy stillness hangs
among the trees and an atmosphere of reverie pervades,
punctuated by brooding thunderstorms. Summer is sprite
season—in the month of Lillipythe, the place is awash with
the fey rascals, who visit the mortal world to cavort.

110

Autumn

The months of Reedwryme, Obthryme, and Braghold. In
the month of Reedwryme, biting winds from the northeast abruptly banish the heady stillness of summer. It is
as if the Wood has awoken from an enchanting dream and
must now busy itself with preparations for the coming
cold. The shivering winds are accompanied by chill mists,
interminable drizzle, and merciless downpours.

Daylight Hours

The hours of sunrise and sunset may be useful on occasion,
especially in relation to PCs setting up camp.

Unseasons

The standard procession of the seasons does not always
turn unhindered. At certain specific points in the year,
rarer environmental conditions—known as unseasons—
may take hold.

Hitching
Occurrence: On Dolmenday—the last day of the year—
there is a 1-in-4 chance of Hitching commencing.
Duration: The first 20 days of the month of Grimvold.
Nature: The trees drip with dew, the woods are filled with
balmy mists, and the eternal night of the fairy realm of
Everborne (p33) encroaches upon the mortal world. In
this unseason, the fey moon shines at night, alongside the
true moon, which the witches pray to.
Effects: A special weather table for the unseason of Hitching is found on p112.

Chame
Occurrence: On each of the first five days of the month of
Haelhold, there is a 1-in-20 chance of Chame beginning.
Duration: 2d10 days.
Nature: Chame is a period of snakes and unease, during
which serpents of all sizes fill the wood, creeping from
underneath rocks and slithering out of holes in trees.
Travel in this unseason is perilous and mortals hide restlessly within doors.
Effects: If an encounter is rolled during Chame, there is a
2-in-6 chance of PCs encountering serpents and wyrms.
In this case, roll on the table below, instead of the normal
encounter tables.

Colliggwyld
Occurrence: On the first day of the month of Iggwyld, there
is a 1-in-4 chance of Colliggwyld beginning.
Duration: The entire month of Iggwyld (30 days).
Nature: Particularly beautiful and fecund fungus blooms
throughout the Wood. These blossoms grow to fantastic proportions, dwarfing humans as they go about their
way. Upon the last eve of Iggwyld, the fungi dissolve into
a rainbow-hued sludge which drains into the rivers and
washes away.
Effects: All fungi located by foraging (see Foraging, p118)
are found in twice the normal quantity—double the
portions of special fungi, and double the rations of edible
fungi.

Vague
Occurrence: On the first day of each week in the months
of Lymewald and Haggryme, there is a 1-in-10 chance of a
Vague beginning.
Duration: 1d6 days.
Nature: A thick, sinister fog emerges from the earth and
rolls in great clouds through the forest. In addition to the
normal hazards of fog, the coming of a Vague is accompanied by a rising of the dead. Ghosts, phantoms, and
ghouls roam with the fogs, ensuring that only the desperate venture out of doors.
Effects: A special weather table for the unseason of Vague is
found on p112. If an encounter is rolled during a Vague,
there is a 2-in-6 chance of PCs encountering undead. In
this case, roll on the table below, instead of the normal
encounter tables.

Weather
Procedures for determining prevailing weather, and its effects on travel.

T

ravel in the wilds of Dolmenwood can be eased or
hampered by the prevailing weather conditions.
A clement day can cheer oppressed spirits, or a
fresh rain can provide a welcome respite from oppressive
midsummer heat. A dense fog can cause travellers to lose
their way in the tangled woods, or a relentless blizzard can
make travel all but impossible.

Weather Effects
(Optional Rule)

Certain weather conditions hinder a party’s travel and
exploration through Dolmenwood. The Weather By Season
table may indicate one or more of the following optional
adverse effects.

Rolling Weather

Travel impeded (I): The party’s daily Travel Points are
reduced by 2. If this reduces the party’s Travel Points to 0
or below, they can only progress by forced marching.

Unseasons: Colliggwyld and Chame do not have special
weather tables of their own—use the standard tables for
spring and summer, respectively.

Poor visibility (V): The distance at which encounters occur
is halved. Additionally, the chance of getting lost while
travelling wild is increased by 1-in-6. For example, travelling wild in hills usually carries a 1-in-6 chance of getting
lost. Travelling wild in hills during a blizzard carries a
2-in-6 chance of getting lost.

Roll on the Weather By Season table once a day to determine the prevailing conditions.

Wet conditions (W): Building a campfire is difficult.

Getting Lost
The ever-present danger of wandering off-course in the wilds.

T

he Dolmenwood Player’s Book describes the
chance of adventurers getting lost while travelling in Dolmenwood. The effects of getting lost
are described here, so that the Referee may maintain a
sense of mystery.

Rolling For Getting Lost

The Referee should roll once per day to see if the party
gets lost, typically at the start of the travel day. If the party
starts the day travelling along a road (no chance of getting
lost), the roll for getting lost is made when they leave the
road.
Chance of getting lost: The chance of getting lost is determined by the terrain type and whether the party is travelling wild or following a track. See Travel, DPB.
If a hunter is in the party: If the party gets lost, a hunter can
find the path again on a 3-in-6 chance.

Effects of Getting Lost

If the party gets lost, roll on the Consequences of Getting
Lost table.

Travelling Off Course
The Referee may handle off-course travel (results 6–9 and
12–15) in two ways, as follows.
Secret: The Referee tracks the party’s actual course on the
map, but does not tell the players that they are travelling
off-course. Players only later realise they have become lost,
and have to revise inaccuracies in their maps.
Open: The Referee informs the players of the actual
(off-course) direction of travel, but does not allow them
to alter this course. Players know that they have become
lost, but have an accurate map of the unintended course
travelled.

CONSEQUENCES OF GETTING LOST
3d6 Consequence
3

Lost in time. Travel is along the intended course, but
1d4+1 days pass.
4
Accidentally stumble into a randomly selected fairy
road. See Fairy Roads, p26.
5
Move in circles, ending the day where it began.
6–7 Travel 90° to the left of the intended course.
8–9 Travel 45° to the left of the intended course.
10–11 Travel along intended course, but uncertain paths
cause all Travel Point costs to be doubled.
12–13 Travel 45° to the right of the intended course.
14–15 Travel 90° to the right of the intended course.
16
Move in circles, ending the day where it began.
17
Knocked unconscious by flashing, coloured lights.
Awaken 1d4 hours later in the hex of a randomly
selected nodal stone. See Ley Lines and Standing
Stones, p18.
18
Enveloped in a bewildering fog. Emerge at the end of
the day in a randomly selected hex (at least 2 hexes
away from the original hex).

Encounters
The beasts, horrors, fairies, and mortal folk one may encounter in the wilds.
ENCOUNTER TYPE

Rolling an Encounter
1. Encounter type: Roll 1d8 on the Encounter Type table.
The result indicates which sub-table to consult.
▶ Aquatic encounters: For encounters on rivers or
lakes, roll directly on the Aquatic regional encounter table. Land-dwelling sentients encountered are
either on boats or the shore.
2. Creature: Roll 1d20 on the indicated sub-table.
▶ Asterisk (*): See Animals—DMB.
▶ Dagger (†): See Adventurers—DMB. Typically Level
1 characters are encountered.
▶ Double dagger (‡): See Everyday Mortals—DMB.
3. Wandering or in lair (optional): The DMB bestiary
lists the chance of encountering creatures in their
lair (as opposed to wandering abroad). For other creatures, a basic 30% chance may be used.
4. Number encountered: The dice to roll are listed after
the creature’s name in the encounter tables.
▶ Lair encounters: Up to 5 times as many individuals may be encountered in the creatures’ lair.
5. Surprise: Each side rolls 1d6, and are surprised on 1–2.
6. Encounter distance: 2d6 × 30′ (or 1d4 × 30′ if both
sides are surprised).
7. Reaction: If the creatures’ potential reaction to PCs
is unclear, optionally make a Reaction Roll—see
Encounters, DPB.

Activity (Optional)
Roll 1d20 to spark a quick idea about what the creature
is doing when encountered.

Fishing
What can be caught in the pools, streams, and lakes of Dolmenwood.

Fishing Procedure
1. Decide to go fishing: The party decides to go fishing
in a hex containing a lake or river. A fishing rod and
tackle are required. See Finding Food in the Wild,
DPB.
2. Chance of catching fish: The party makes a Survival
Check, using the highest chance of success of all characters. If the party devotes a whole day exclusively
to fishing, without travelling, they gain a +2 bonus. If
the check succeeds, the party has caught something.
3. Determine catch: Roll 1d20 to see what is caught.
4. Yield: The party gains 2d6 fresh rations.

Encounters
Roll for encounters as normal during a day’s fishing.
Waterside encounters use the aquatic encounter table
or the regional table.

Edible Fish

1. Bally-tom: Rotund, slow-swimming fish with silver
scales and bulbous green eyes. When threatened, their
eyes flash hypnotically. The party member with the
lowest Wisdom must Save Versus Hold or be dazzled and
fall splashing into the water. (Lone anglers—without a
companion to rescue them—have been known to drown
as a result.)
2. Braithgilly: Lithe, white-scaled trout with adorable pink
eyes. When unafraid, braithgillies poke their heads above
the surface and sing beautiful, wistful melodies. Their
songs sometimes contain snippets of well-known folk-melodies and passages that sound almost like words. According to folklore, braithgillies willingly leap into the net of
a maiden who sings to them under the light of the moon.

3. Butter-eel: 3′-long, buttery-brown eels with startled,
gaping mouths and a tendency to writhe vigorously when
caught. Butter-eels are coated with a fatty slime, making
them difficult to land, requiring at least two PCs make a
successful Dexterity Check.
4. Gaffer: Foot-long catfish with tufts of coarse white fur
around their face and gills, often formed into a goat-like
beard upon the chin. Bleat when dragged from the water.
Their flesh is tough but has a palatable sweet-sour note.
5. Giant catfish: A real monster! Handle as a normal combat
encounter (see giant catfish stats in the DMB). If the fish is
killed, its flesh provides 4 rations per Hit Point.
6. Groper: Flat-bodied, green-skinned bottom feeders
with gaping mouths and spacious gullets. There is a 2-in-6
chance of finding a random human trinket (DPB) in a fish’s
belly.
7. Gurney: Big, ball-shaped fish with beady eyes, misshapen
faces, and wide, flapping mouths. They are known among
anglers for their habit of suddenly snapping with their
concealed rows of vicious, spiny teeth. Characters who
have not caught gurneys before must Save Versus Doom
or suffer 1 point of damage.
8. Hameth sprat: Little black-scaled fish with long, ribbon
tails. Flit around in great swarms, especially numerous in
the River Hameth. Eaten whole (bones and all), typically
fried in batter. A catch of hameth sprats only provides 2d4
rations.
9. Lardfish: Head-sized, translucent cream jellyfish
with tangled tentacles dotted with clusters of grape-like
nodules. The body of a lardfish is tough and somewhat
fatty, but its tentacles are sweet and succulent.
10. Maid-o’-the-lake: Thigh-sized, pink, translucent squids
renowned as a Dolmenwood delicacy. Their flesh is succulent and has a mildly fruity flavour. According to folklore,
feasting beneath the moon on these squids fried in garlic
butter is a sure way to summon the attentions of a witch,
who will visit in the dead of night.
11. Mummer: Sluggish, puffy fish with mud-brown scales,
pink, ribbon-like fins, and bulbous, yellow faces of an
unnervingly human-like cast. There is a 3-in-6 chance that
the face of one of the caught fish has an uncanny resemblance to a family member of someone in the party.
12. Nag-pike: Muscular, 3′-long, snaggle-toothed pikes
with nine crooked horns upon their heads. Nag-pikes are
vicious and tenacious, making them tricky to catch. The
catch is only landed if at least two PCs make a successful
Strength Check. When sliced and fried, nag-pikes’ flesh is
deliciously gamy.

116

Part Four | Ex plor ing the Wild

13. Orbling: Silvery, spherical jellyfish that hide in weeds
during the day and only emerge after sundown. In shaded
waters, they bob near the surface, resembling reflected
moonlight. Their outer skin is rubbery, but their insides
are soft and taste of toffee. They are typically eaten like
boiled eggs, by slicing off the top and scooping out the
insides with a spoon.
14. Pilgrim crab: Chunky violet crabs with long, delicate
pincers and creamy-white underbellies. Their shells are
graven with lines that look curiously like a religious script
of some kind. (These are sometimes used as a means of
fortune-telling.) If cooked alive, pilgrim crabs emit a shrill
tone reminiscent of choirboys at practice.
15. Puffer: 2′-round, near-spherical fish covered with
hard scales and spines. Puffers are slow moving and easy
to catch. Killing and preparing them is the tricky part:
they have a gas-filled organ that explodes if not handled
correctly. Characters who have not caught puffers before
must Save Versus Blast or suffer 1d3 damage when the
fish explode.
16. Queen’s salmon: Iridescent-scaled salmon that dart
and leap playfully. Queen’s salmon are fairy fish that visit
Dolmenwood to spawn. They speak Sylvan and basic Woldish, and address anglers in squeaking little voices when
caught. In return for their lives, a catch of these fish offer

to place their blessing upon the noble anglers. If the fish
are released, each member of the fishing party gains a +4
bonus to the next Saving Throw rolled against a deadly
effect (e.g. death, petrification, poison, etc.).
17. Screaming jenny: Long, slender fish with frilly purple
fins and tails. When pulled from the water, they emit a
startling shriek, which has a 3-in-6 chance of attracting a
wandering monster (see Encounters, p114).
18. Smuggler-fish: Puffed up, putrid green fish with lemon
yellow bellies and wide, astonished eyes. Sigh plaintively
then give up the ghost when landed. There is a 2-in-6
chance of finding a small gem (1d20 × 10gp) in the belly of
one of the caught fish.
19. Twine-eel: 3′-long, twisty, finger-thick eels with scales
of purple or burnished pink. Swim in great schools and
voraciously attack small prey and tempting morsels of bait.
Preparing them is fiddly work, due to all the fine bones, but
their delectably sweet flesh makes it worthwhile.
20. Wraithfish: Lazy weed-browsers with near-transparent, jelly-like, white flesh. Wraithfish can turn incorporeal
for brief periods, a trick they invariably perform when
yanked out of the water by anglers. Madcap pipe music
stymies this ability, and woodgrues are expert wraithfish catchers. Parties fishing without the requisite musical
accompaniment only land fish sufficient for 1d6 rations.

Part Four | Ex plor ing the Wild

Foraging
Bountiful delights to dig up in the undergrowth.

Foraging Procedure
1. Decide to forage: The party decides to forage for food
as they travel. See Finding Food in the Wild, DPB.
2. Chance of finding food: The party makes a Survival
Check, using the highest chance of success of all characters. If the party devotes a whole day exclusively to
foraging, without travelling, they gain a +2 bonus. If
the check succeeds, the party has found edible wild
plants or fungi.
3. Determine foraged food:
▶ Hex-specific results: Some hex descriptions note
special plants or fungi found by successful foraging. This may be instead of or in addition to general
foraging results.
▶ General results: Roll 1d6 to determine whether
fungi or plants are found (1–3: fungi, 4–6: plants). Roll
1d20 to determine the type.
4. Yield: The party gains 1d6 fresh rations.

Encounters
Roll for encounters as normal during a day’s foraging.

Edible Fungi

1. Amethyst orb: Transparent violet spheres with moist
orifices. Smell of horse manure; hearty, chicken-like taste.
2. Chanctonslip: Flat, brown mushrooms that grow on tree
trunks. Smell of fine pipeleaf, taste of spiced pumpkin.
3. Drounberry: Walnut-sized buttons, jet black with bright
yellow gills. Odourless, but taste mildly of pepper.
4. Fairy veil: Silvery latticeworks that shine golden in
moonlight. Smell faintly of leek, taste of kiwi. This fungus
is perfectly nourishing, but is seldom foraged due to folktales claiming it is the property of the Cold Prince.
5. Goodgilly: Tall mushrooms with great, white, orb-like
caps and pale pink gills. Smell of fresh rain. The caps taste
of rotten fish, while the gills have a delicate, cinnamon
flavour.
6. Hell horns: Ominous, black antlers with red striations.
Smell of vomit, taste like lettuce. Hell horns are highly
nutritious: a single ration can nourish two people instead
of one.
7. Liverwort Jack: Mustard yellow toadstools with indigo
spots. Odourless, taste of raw liver.
8. Mangy horns: Floppy red phalluses that ooze black juice.
Smell of bark, taste of cooked apple. Mangy horns are tasty
when eaten raw, but become tough and chewy if cooked.

118

9. Marshguts: Coils of glowing yellow tubes. Smell of
sweat, with an odd, extremely moreish, fizzy flavour.
10. Meat and bread: Spherical sacs of deep blue hue with
cyan stripes. Smell like raw meat, taste like stale bread.
Cause stinking, rancid breath which attracts flies.
11. Monkskull: Tan coloured, brain-like mushrooms. Smell
like pine and taste bloody. Perfectly nourishing, but something of an acquired taste.
12. Moonchook: White, moon-like orbs, with pocked
craters. Smell like chicken soup, taste like raw onion.
Moonchook mushrooms are a gourmet culinary item in
Dolmenwood. Each ration can be sold for 1d6gp.
13. Old Duchess: Pink flutes with mauve stems. Smell like
sewage, but taste of pineapple. It is the usual practice to
hold one’s nose while eating.
14. Purple piper: Foot-wide, purple puffballs that emit
drifts of pale green spores. Smell like wet dog, taste like
old cabbage.
15. Scrabey’s hair: Mud brown, wispy filaments that ooze a
lime green gel. Smell like beer and taste like a bland, mealy
porridge.
16. Shank-orbs: Masses of gloopy, crimson orbs, spotted
with droplets of white juice. Smell like leaf mould, with a
metallic taste. Edible, but have no nutritive effect.
17. Spatchcock: Chunky, grey bracket fungi. Smell and taste
of roasting game. Spatchcock mushrooms are one of the
woodsman’s most treasured delicacies. Once foraged, they
dissolve into slime within the day, so are rarely tasted by
townsfolk.
18. Willy-be-bold: Tall, brown mushrooms with great,
floppy caps and dark green gills. Smell of blue cheese, but
have very little flavour. When eaten, these mushrooms
inhibit social awkwardness.
19. Windcap: Oyster clusters, tan in colour, with maroon
patches. Smell like burnt hair, with a strange, anti-flavour
that numbs the tongue. Nourishing, but produce awful
flatulence.
20. Woodsman’s fancy: Black and yellow striped, hairy
spheres. Smell of strong solvent and taste of lavender.
Woodsman’s fancy mushrooms bring on a very mild
drunkenness and trigger the unbridled growth of hair
from the nostrils and cheeks.

Part Four | Ex plor ing the Wild

Edible Plants

1. Barb cone: Horribly barbed pine cones that conceal a
profusion of fatty nuts. Taste like bacon dripping.
2. Bent leek: Wild vegetables with narrow, lank leaves that
droop 2–3′ across the ground. Strong garlic flavour.
3. Black medlar: Rock hard, pink, inedible fruits. When
they have lain in the undergrowth for a season, they
become soft, slimy, and black. Sickly marshmallow flavour.
4. Bogsnip: A marsh-dwelling, wild relative of the common
parsnip. Foraging bogsnips invariably involves wading
into muddy pools, but the reward is a delightfully creamy
root. Best pan-fried.
5. Butter mandrake: Anthropomorphic roots that wriggle
when dug up and thrash when cooked. Hard and woody,
but soften up when boiled. Deliciously buttery. Butter
mandrakes are the safest and least defiant member of the
mandrake family to deal with.
6. Creeping prune: Delectable miniature, purple fruits of
a vine that creeps through the undergrowth and occasionally a short way up tree trunks. Taste like plum brandy.
7. Gobble-drop: Bulbous black berries clustered atop a
thick green stem. Smell like offal, but taste sweet and crisp.
8. Hag’s mantle: Thick, furry, bright green leaves of a
shade-dwelling herb. Their sulphurous aroma and furry
texture are unpleasant, but the sweet, pungent flavour is
a treat for the road-weary.
9. Hangleberry: Clusters of inch-round, succulent crimson fruits that dangle tantalisingly from high branches.
Unpleasantly slimy texture, but taste delectably sweet.
10. Hob nut: Clusters of nuts encased in a hard shell that
looks like a fairy’s tiny fist. Nourishing but have a somewhat unappealing taste (like stale bread). Eating a ration
of hob nuts brings on a whimsical foolhardiness which
lasts until the next day, incurring a –2 penalty to Saving
Throws against magic.

Identifying Species
Initially, only the physical characteristics (i.e. colour,
form, smell, etc.) of foraged specimens should be
described to the players.
Common species: Species listed on this page or in the
Dolmenwood Player’s Book are common enough that
PCs recognise them and know them by name.
Unusual species: Other species are unusual and cannot
be automatically identified by PCs. Players may collect
specimens, investigate them further, or even risk eating
them. In time, players may come to recognise certain
species by their description and learn their names from
herbalists.
16. Snodberry: The tiny, blue berries of a horridly thorny
bush. The odd, bitter / sweet taste does not make them
worth the scratches entailed in harvesting them, but they
grow in vast quantities so can at least provide a solid meal.
17. Wallow shoot: Pointy purple leaf-shoots that poke out
from foetid puddles. The outer leaves are hard and scaly,
but the insides are succulent and taste like pears.
18. Westernut: Tiny purplish nuts encased in incredibly
hard shells. Require serious work to extract, but have a
delightful flavour akin to popcorn. Grow only at the base
of west-facing cliffs or ridges.
19. Witch-elm lantern: Papery, violet lanterns that conceal
clusters of hard, green berries. Wince-inducingly tart, but
highly nourishing. Local folk fear to harvest the fruits of
the witch-elm, for it is said that the Queen of All Witches
covets them for herself.
20. Wranklefrond: Delicate, hairy, green shoots of a
common fern. Smell like beer; taste fresh and gingery.

21. Jellycup: Lambent orbs of orange, violet, or lime green
jelly that droop from the top of a sunflower-like stem. Difficult to harvest without bursting. Typically eaten by squeezing the syrupy flesh into a bowl. Eating jellycups after dark
brings on a very mild state of psychedelia wherein even the
gravest circumstances seem comical.
12. Lankleaf root: Tangled root balls of a spiny bog shrub.
Cleaning out the dirt from among the roots is time-consuming. Once boiled, the roots dissolve into a starchy
pudding with a pleasant, smoky flavour.
13. Noosenut: Soft, hairy-shelled, orange nuts about the
size of an eyeball. Very mild, slightly milky flavour. Noosenut trees are said to grow on ground where a criminal was
once hanged.
14. Prehensile radish: Long white radishes identified
aboveground by their bright pink stem clusters. Squirm
like the tail of an angry monkey when uprooted. Taste of
rotten egg with an aftertaste of cinnamon.
15. Shankroot: Long, black, hairy, sickle-shaped roots
that take quite some effort to dig up. The skin is tough
and bitter, but the flesh is tender and juicy, with a cherry
flavour.

Hunting
The game animals of Dolmenwood and how to hunt them.
Hunting Procedure
1. Decide to hunt: The party decides to try to creep up
on game animals as they travel. See Finding Food in
the Wild, DPB.
2. Chance of stalking: The party makes a Survival
Check, using the highest chance of success of all characters. If the party devotes a whole day exclusively to
hunting, without travelling, they gain a +2 bonus. If
the check succeeds, the party has stalked and crept
up on game animals.
3. Determine quarry: Roll 1d20 on the Game Animals
table to see what type of animals the party has crept
up on. Game animals are described under Animals,
DMB.
4. Number of animals: The dice to roll are listed after
the animal’s name in the Game Animals table.
5. Combat: Having crept up on game animals, the
party can attempt to kill them. This is handled as a
normal combat encounter. The party has surprise
(see Surprise under Encounters, DPB) and begins the
encounter 1d4 × 30′ away from the quarry.
6. Yield: The party gains fresh rations based on the Hit
Points of game animals killed: 1 ration per HP for
Small animals, 2 rations per HP for Medium, and 4
rations per HP for Large (or more for extremely large
creatures, per the Referee’s judgement).

Encounters
Roll for encounters as normal during a day’s hunting.

Eating Other Creatures
When adventurers go hunting, they are specifically
looking out for commonly known game animals. All
characters can identify such animals and know how
to cook them.
Upon occasion, characters may consider eating the
flesh of other, less commonly consumed creatures.
The Referee must judge which creatures are edible,
which are too repulsive to eat, which cause sickness,
and which are outright poisonous.

Blackeswell
1604—Isolated
1604
—Isolated Mulchgrove village, nearing the utmost decay of its former wealth.

A

Sylvain Aster—Tailor and Council Leader

Inhabitants (90—village): A proud and somewhat inbred
folk who cling to the remnants of their ancestors’ prosperity. Visitors to Blackeswell are rare, and new settlers
ever rarer (though its isolation appeals to a certain type
of eccentric).

Demeanour (Neutral): Narcissistic, two-faced. Clasps
his hands together in delight.

village of finely-built houses and stores, slowly
falling into disrepair. Blackeswell is situated
beside a stinking pool in the isolated northern reaches of Mulchgrove, now subsumed in the slowly
expanding fungal forest.

Ruler: Blackeswell is within the domain of House Guillefer
(see hex 1304), but is nigh forgotten and virtually independent. The village is managed by a council of representatives of six guilds—the guilds of tailors, lenders, taverners,
masons, jewellers, and chandlers. The tailor, Sylvain Aster,
is the elected leader of the council.
Religion: The people of Blackeswell are devotees of St
Gondyw. The ostentatious and fastidiously maintained
church of St Gondyw on the village square is by far the
largest remaining building in the settlement.
Rumours: See Rumours in Blackeswell, p442.

Former Mining Riches
Blackeswell was founded at the site of a rich vein of Hag
Iron, a rare metal renowned for its curative properties
when crafted into jewellery. Wagon-loads of the metal were
exported from the village to Castle Brackenwold and trade
brought great prosperity—a thriving marketplace, amenities to entertain merchants, and artisans’ workshops soon
followed. Blackeswell gained a reputation as a place of good
taste and exquisite craftsmanship.

Trade Stopped, Blackeswell Forgotten
200 years ago, the vein of Hag Iron began to dry up. Trade
slowed, as ever smaller quantities of the metal were
extracted. Eventually the mine was exhausted and trade
halted. Blackeswell’s reputation faded and the village
became little more than a curiosity on old maps.

Abandoned Buildings
The population of Blackeswell has greatly diminished since
the village’s heyday and many once-proud buildings have
been abandoned. Some, fallen into utter ruin, have been
demolished and cleared, while others remain standing,
empty and half decrepit, reminders of the past.

Ever Present Stench of the Blacke
Blackeswell is pervaded by a fishy, rotting stench wafting
from the pool beside which it sits, known to locals as the
Blacke. The villagers are completely inured to the smell,
but visitors find it impossible to ignore.

124

A broad-faced human man in his forties, with sparkling
green eyes, a dazzling smile, prodigious red sideburns,
and a shiny monocle. Dresses in paisley waistcoats,
billowing silk pantaloons, and pompously plumed
velvet caps.

Speech: Affectedly upper class. Seldom wishes to speak
of non-sartorial matters. Woldish.
Desires: To discover the intent of the outsiders Mr
Klepp and Mr Paronax in Blackeswell and to convince
the council to ban the sale of property to non-Blackeswellers. For his singular vision of costumery to be
celebrated far and wide, bringing prosperity to Blackeswell once more.

Green Waters, Green-Tinged Skin
The people of Blackeswell drink the stinking, green water
of the Blacke, guzzling down mugs of the stuff with gusto
(an acquired taste!). The constant consumption of the
contaminated water lends their skin a pallid tint, with a
distinct greenish tinge visible under candlelight.
Noxious to outsiders: Outsiders who consume the unprocessed waters of the Blacke become sick, suffering from
vomiting and shakes for 1d4 days (–1 penalty to Attack Rolls
and Saving Throws).

Enigmatic Outsiders Moving In
The mysterious outsider Mr Klepp, said to be of Castle
Brackenwold, recently purchased an old warehouse in
Blackeswell and has moved in all manner of odd equipment. Agents of the equally enigmatic Mr Paronax are said
to be eyeing derelict buildings for purchase. The intent
of these out-of-town folk in Blackeswell is unclear, but
according to certain Blackeswellers the interest of “city
folk” bodes ill. The vicar, Father Bertil (p126), and the
council leader, Sylvain Aster, secretly plot to discover more
about the outsiders’ (presumably nefarious) schemes.

Equipment Availability

All equipment in Blackeswell costs double the standard
price. Rope purchased here is greenish-white, made from
fungal fibres harvested in Mulchgrove. Only rustic weapons (e.g. arrows, daggers, shortbows, slings, staves) are
available. No form of armour can be bought in Blackeswell.

1. The Blacke

Once a cheery stream, shifting waters in Mulchgrove gradually transformed the Blacke into a foetid pool, choked
with silt and stinking purple lilies.
Abandoned huts: Long-disused fishing huts, now ruined
and rotting, stand along the shore.

2. Village Square

A broad, paved square, neatly maintained but seldom used.
An eerie emptiness pervades.
Statue of St Gondyw: To the west of the square stands a
white marble statue of the saint clad in mail, holding aloft
a lantern and carrying an unfurled scroll.
Breggle statue: On the square’s eastern edge, a comical
diorama depicts three laughing maidens, waving coyly,
pursued by a leering shorthorn.
Watchtower: A locked brick building (the village watch was
long ago disbanded) with a rickety wooden lookout tower
stands at the south-east corner of the square. Sylvain Aster
(p124) keeps the keys to the tower.

3. Church of St Gondyw

A grand church in an unusual provincial style, worthy of
a much larger town. A tall bell tower with a weathercockatrice at its apex overlooks the village.
Entrance: Beautifully wrought doors of black iron.
Interior: An austere space of cold stone pews and stark
pillars, with a plain marble altar. The only decoration is a
huge portrait of St Gondyw staring down from the ceiling.
The vicar, Father Bertil, potters in the adjoining parsonage.
Populace: The occasional devout local. Generally empty.
Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of St
Gondyw: the ability to cast Bless. See Shrines, p22.
Graveyard: Ringed with iron railings, with an ornamental
gate in the south-east corner. The neat rows of tombstones
clearly denote the greater population in centuries past.

Father Ingram Bertil—Vicar of Blackeswell
An ageing, frizzy-haired human bachelor with bent
spectacles and bristling, white eyebrows.
Demeanour (Neutral): Animated, scatty. Wonky grin.
Speech: Flighty, well enunciated. Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: To expel meddling outsiders. To do as little
work as possible—gladly lets the pious villagers take
care of many of his duties.

4. Abandoned Mine

A decrepit, tiled-roof building—the former headquarters
of the Blackeswell Mining Co—stands beside the fenced-off
mining pit which was the source of Blackeswell’s former
wealth. The boarded up building and the gate to the pit are
both locked—Sylvain Aster (p124) keeps the keys.

5. The Crooked Arm (Inn)

A homely, rural inn with a sagging, tiled roof. At the southeast corner, a closed hatch gives access to the cellar.
Sign: A Chapes holy symbol hanging in the crook of a
flexed arm.
Common room: A gloomy space of black beams, sombre
portraits, and pipesmoke-stained walls. The landlady,
Arbie Snyde, serves from a solid oak counter.
Guests: The occasional morose local or lone traveller.

Services at the Crooked Arm
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB).
Drinks: The local, frothing green ale (Fishfop’s), 8cp a mug.
No other drinks are served.
Stabling: Mounts are accommodated in the adjacent goat
field, with no form of shelter. 2sp per mount.

Arbie Snyde—Crooked Arm Proprietor
A stooped, corpulent human woman in her fifties, with
a mop of grey hair, pendulous jowls, and a peg leg.
Demeanour (Neutral): Sombre, penny-pinching.
Perpetually grimacing—as if she is the only villager
who can smell the Blacke.
Speech: Cantankerous drawl. Woldish.
Desires: Money. To relocate to Castle Brackenwold.

6. The Spigot and Gullet
(Tavern)

A low, one-storey tavern with a door on each side and
numerous round, porthole-like windows. The thatched
roof is topped with a wooden sea monster’s head.
Sign: A sea monster clutching ale kegs in its maw.
Common room: A round room with too few tables, too
many chairs, and a wobbly drinks table at one side. Locals
serve themselves, as the landlady, Gilly-Ann Locke,
carouses and dances to the ever-present fiddle music.
Guests: Merry, tipsy locals, dancing, boozing, and chewing
the fat. An occasional pedlar selling wares.

Services at the Spigot and Gullet
Food: Of poor quality (DPB).
Fishfop’s: Frothing green ale (locally brewed), 8cp a mug.
Other drinks: Are imported and cost twice normal price.

Gilly-Ann Locke—Spigot and Gullet Proprietor
A busty human woman in her 60s, with curly locks and
remarkably hairy ears. Dresses in stretched woollens.
Demeanour (Lawful): Nosy, open-minded. Wipes her
nose on her sleeve.
Speech: Vulgar, chummy. Woldish.
Desires: Tales from afar. To welcome Mr Klepp to the
village by cooking his favourite food for him.

7. Council House

A once-stately building of plastered stone, that is now
beginning to crumble. A tower stands at the south-east
corner, now home to a great colony of rooks. The council
meets here once a month, but the building is otherwise
little used.

8. Fish Market

The stink of fresh fish wafts from this low, tin-roofed
marketplace. Most of the fish on sale are oddly green-hued
and many have unusual features such as extra eyes, clusters of tentacles, human-like snouts, or two heads.

9. Aster’s Fine
Costumery (Tailor)

A tidy little store on the edge of the village. Mannequins
stand outside, sporting outlandish waistcoats and caps.
Interior: Overbrimming with mannequins, display cases,
and bolts of fabric. The tailor, Sylvain Aster (p124), greets
clients, while his aide, the dour Henricus Buttons, stitches
furiously in the back room.

Services at Aster’s
Fashionable outfits: 50gp “off the rack,” 100gp (or more)
tailored. Aster’s concept of fashion is highly idiosyncratic.

10. Klepp’s Workshop

A long, one-storey building that was recently purchased
by a mysterious out-of-towner, Mr Klepp.
Strange shipments: Furnishings, workbenches, and
crates of equipment arrive by cart every 2–3 weeks and
are unloaded into the workshop by folk from Castle Brackenwold. They are under strict orders of secrecy.
Mr Klepp: Intends to move to the village once his workshop is established. Unbeknown to any in Blackeswell, he
is an artificer specialising in clockwork automata.
Locked: The shuttered windows and the massive stone
front door are locked tight.
Interior: Crates of gears, rivets, and metal plates, watched
by a clockwork guardian programmed to expel intruders.

Clockwork Guardian
A hulking, 6′ tall, humanoid automaton of brass and
bolts, powered by gears, springs, and coils.

11. Fishfop Brewery

A small brewery with a massive brick chimney, providing
for all the village’s spirituous needs. Clusters of barrels
stand outside, reeking of fish and pondweed, their lids ajar
and overbrimming with pale green foam.

12. Disused Granary

A squat, square stone tower of two storeys overlooking the
Blacke. A cacophony of croaking can often be heard from
its empty windows and door frame.
Interior: A colony of 15 quag toads has taken up residence
in the slime-drenched rooms of the ruin. They do not
appreciate people poking around in their lair.

Quag Toads
2′ long, black-skinned toads with quizzically rotating
eyeballs and mouths full of gnarled fangs.

Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).

An ill-repaired, cobbled road that dwindles and is
subsumed by dense fungal forest after 200 yards. The
road once carried trade to Castle Brackenwold, travelling
southward through Mulchgrove (via the chasm in 1605)
and meeting the King’s Road in hex 1608, just east of the
town.

Castle Brackenwold
1508—The
1508
—The Castle and the Inner City.

L

ocated four miles from the eaves of Dolmenwood, the fortified castle and keep of the dukes of
Brackenwold sit proudly atop a tall hill, with a city
stretched at their feet. While the name Castle Brackenwold
properly refers only to the castle itself, the surrounding
city is commonly included in the designation.
Inhabitants (8,700—city): As is the way in all large settlements, folk of all kinds live in Castle Brackenwold. The total
population is just under 9,000 souls, principally humans
native to the city, but with a sizeable number of immigrants from elsewhere in the Duchy and beyond. Approximately 1,000 people dwell within the walled Inner City
(the area depicted in the map opposite).
Ruler: The Duke of Brackenwold himself (p58) directly
rules over Castle Brackenwold.
Religion: Castle Brackenwold is the seat of the Pluritine
Church in the Dolmenwood region. As such, it is the site
of the great Cathedral of St Signis (p132). Even in the
bustling metropolis, however, seemingly a world apart
from the rustic ways of Dolmenwood, remnants of ancient
Gwyrae worship can be spotted.
Rumours: See Rumours in Castle Brackenwold, p443.

The Outer City
The sprawling region of teetering abodes, twisting alleys,
and seedy taverns contained within the city’s outer wall.
The Outer City is home to the everyday folk of Castle Brackenwold—labourers, common craftspeople, thieves, and
beggars. The map opposite focuses on the Inner City and
only depicts the innermost region of the Outer City.

The Inner City
The city’s commercial hub, where the primary markets,
traders’ districts, courts of law, and public institutions of
learning are found. The Inner City is ringed with a second,
inner wall. The map opposite shows the Inner City in its
entirety.

Castle Hill—Clod’s Seat
In the south-east corner of the Inner City, a steep, rocky
hill known as Clod’s Seat rises.
Lower wall and gates: A wall protects the bottom of the
hill, manned with city guards. A single gate pierces the wall
where a grand stairway ascends to the castle (see Clod’s
Stair and The Headless Gate, p131).
Upper gates: Several gates from the castle itself grant
access to the woods and gardens of the hill.
Origin of the name: The name Clod’s Seat is believed to be
derived from “Clewyd’s Seat,” in reference to the location
of the bishop’s palace atop the hill.

128

The Castle
Looming over the city, at the summit of Clod’s Seat, stands
the castle proper, home to the Duke of Brackenwold, and
the seat of the bishop. The castle is ringed with a tall
stone wall with battlements and is deemed impregnable.
(Though in sooth this has not been tested in many centuries.)

Equipment Availability

In addition to the standard equipment and services listed
in the DPB, unusual, non-standard businesses can be
located with a little investigative work.

1. The Ducal Keep

A lofty, white stone keep with numerous towers, turrets,
minarets. The ducal keep is the ancestral home to the
nobility of the Brackenwold line.
Entrance: A fortified, portcullised gate guarded by an elite
soldiery. The gate usually stands open.
Interior: Exorbitant luxury. A seemingly endless procession of hallways, studies, drawing rooms, dining halls, and
suites. Luxurious carpets, gold-leafed doorways, exquisite
cabinetry, artisan wallpapers painted with scenes from
fable and history.
Inhabitants: The Duke of Brackenwold (p58), the Duchess of Brackenwold (p59), their unmarried daughter
(Zoemina—a dashing and highly eligible young woman
of 22), their youngest son (Edmund—a callow lad of 14), the
Dowager Duchess (the duke’s elderly mother—decrepit,
dithering, and highly demanding), a continually shifting
entourage of noble visitors, and nigh on a hundred servants.
Fairy origins: Castle Brackenwold is an ancient place
whose oldest parts were built by elf lords in days of
yore, long before the people of Brackenwold migrated to
Dolmenwood. This fact has blurred into legends hinting at
the fairy blood of the noble line of Brackenwold.

The Lost Wing
Inhabitants and curious-minded visitors to the keep are
perplexed by tales of a lost suite of rooms, visible from the
outside but which no internal doors or stairways reach.
Impetuous young nobles of each generation attempt to
gain entrance to the lost rooms, but invariably meet an
unpleasant and mysterious doom.

The Oubliette
A secret place, known as the oubliette, lies in the dungeons
of the keep. Its mere existence is a closely guarded secret—
indeed, only the duke, the bishop, and five elite guards
know of the place. In this accursed vault lurks the presence of an ancient evil, chained within the form of a
stone throne atop a great pedestal. A pact was made in the
unknown past, compelling each duke of the line of Brackenwold to sacrifice his first born daughter to the entity in
the oubliette. Their “disappearances” have been noted and
are interpreted as a curse on the family. See Family under
Duke Thespian III of Brackenwold, p58 and Duchess
Ophelia of Brackenwold, p59.

The Witches’ Library
The ladies of the Brackenwold line, despite their close ties
with the bishopry, have a propensity toward witchcraft.
Those who show interest and potential are shown the
secret passages that lead to the occult library in the dusty
attics of a little-used tower. While few of the Brackenwold
ladies are ever fully initiated into the sisterhood, they are
allied with the witches and secretly work for their benefit.

130

2. Bishop’s Palace

An imposing, church-like building of black stone. The
administrative locus of the Church within the Duchy of
Brackenwold and home of the bishop.
Entrance: A grandiose gateway with exquisite carvings,
in bronze and granite, depicting the souls of the righteous
ascending to heaven.
Interior: Cathedralesque vaulted halls, sombre reading
rooms, plush studies, and opulent appointment chambers.
Inhabitants: The Bishop of Brackenwold (p69), several
dozen assistants and librarians, several dozen servants,
and a varying number of visiting Church dignitaries.

The Throne Room
Located at the centre of palace, this grand, vaulted stone
hall is where the bishop meets with those he wishes to
impress or intimidate. The place is starkly decorated, with
a red carpet leading up to the bishop’s imposing throne.
No other seating is available. Behind the throne, bishops
of the past peer disapprovingly from portraits hung in
velvet-curtained alcoves.

The Episcopal Library
An entire wing of the palace is devoted to its library—stuffy,
silent halls with shelves 15′ high. The library’s thousands
of books cover all imaginable topics in some detail, but
focus most heavily on the chronology of the Church and
accounts of the deeds and miracles of the saints. Entrance
to the library is by permission from the bishop only.

The Stellarium and the Night Tower
Bishop Pastoral II, who dwelt in the palace some 150 years
past, was enamoured of astronomy and had several additions made to the building. The stellarium, featuring a map

3. Seminary of the 100
Martyrs

A 4-storeyed edifice decorated with grimacing gargoyles
of dark stone. Priests of the Pluritine Church dwelling in
the Dolmenwood region are trained within these halls.
Entrance: Three lofty gateways grant access to the Seminary, leading to the libraries, the chapel, and the dormitories.
Interior: Bustling common rooms, hushed hallways,
contemplative courtyards.
Inhabitants: Abbot Hargle (p69), Sanctus Primus
(p71), 100 monastics and priests in training, 15 clerics

The Theological Libraries
Most of the first floor is dedicated to libraries for research
into particularities of Church doctrine and canon law.
The vaults: A spiral stair leads from the library into a
locked crypt wherein texts of a questionable nature are
hidden. Among their number are certain tomes of magic
the Church has deemed heretical.
Sage consultation: Abbot Hargle and his assistants can
sometimes be engaged to research matters of Church lore.
Apply the standard rules for hiring a sage (DPB). These
services may be offered free of charge to other servants
of the Church.

Dormitories
The upper floor and attics house the monastics who dwell
in the Seminary.
Lodging: Characters who serve the Pluritine Church (e.g.
clerics, friars) may request lodging in the Seminary. Those
with their own means are expected to donate 2sp per night
for simple monastic lodgings and food.

The Holy Gaol
Secreted in a covert corner of the crypts is a series of gaols
and interrogation chambers. It is here that the Order of St
Faxis keeps political prisoners, Drunes, and witches for
interrogation.

4. Ducal Barracks

A long, low building of heavy stone with many small
windows. Home to the castle garrison.
Entrance: Towering doors of studded oak emblazoned
with coats of arms.
Interior: Spartan mess halls, plush officers’ studies and
smoking rooms, stark bunk rooms.
Inhabitants: Captain Bogle (commander of the garrison),
80 soldiers, a dozen staff.

5. Tourney Grounds

The paved inner courtyard of the castle, used as a practice
grounds for the duke’s soldiery and knights.

The Duke’s Tourney
The Duke of Brackenwold hosts a great tourney here at
midsummer each year, when the gates of the castle are
open to the general populace. In addition to the traditional
challenges of skill at arms, a hunting contest takes place in
Dolmenwood, the winner of which is, by ancient decree,
welcomed as a guest of the duke for one night.

6. Clod’s Stair and the
Headless Gate

A wide stair climbs the steep northern slope of Clod’s Seat,
ascending from the streets of the Inner City to the castle
itself. At the summit, the castle gate is flanked by two huge
(30′ tall) statues of warrior kings. Both are headless.
Ducal guards: Soldiers dressed in shining plate mail,
purple capes, and unicorn-topped helmets, man the stair
and gate. 2d6+6 are stationed at any given time. Treat as
Level 3 fighters (DMB).

Captain Merriman Bogle—Commander of the
Garrison (Level 10 Fighter)
A red-cheeked, white-whiskered human man in his
middle years, never seen without his pipe in his teeth.
Confidante and hunting companion of the duke and
veteran of a number of minor wars. Known for his
mistrust of longhorns, especially Lord Malbleat (p64).
Demeanour (Lawful): Boastful, overbearing, rigorous.

7. Cathedral of St Signis

The centre of worship in the city, the great cathedral of St
Signis rivals the Ducal Keep in height and grandeur. The
cathedral’s exterior is a masterwork of architecture, bristling with gargoyles and flying buttresses.
Entrance: A vaulted gateway with exquisite ceiling frescoes depicting the One True God’s judgement of the dead.
Interior: An echoing nave of breathtaking height and
architectural ingenuity, supported by pillars and ribs
resembling the trunks and limbs of trees. Candle holders and censers of pure gold. A 20′ marble statue of St
Signis standing cloaked behind the altar. A profusion of
side-chapels dedicated to other saints.
Populace: Weeping supplicants, silent priests.
Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of St
Signis: the ability to cast Silence. See Shrines, p22.

8. Square of the Eidolon

A wide, brick-paved square with a great iron statue at
the centre. It depicts a looming phantom dressed in rags
(known as the Eidolon), harried by two (much smaller)
winged angels with swords.
Inscription: Mysterious runes in an unknown script are
graven into the statue’s base. Even magical analysis has
failed to reveal their meaning.
Origin: The statue’s origin is unknown. The Church
interpretation of its symbolism is that it represents the
righteous conversion of Dolmenwood to the faith of the
Pluritine Church. The common local belief, however, is
that the Eidolon represents a cloaked Atacorn (one of the
offspring of the Nag-Lord) leading the angels into the
clutches of their sire. Both interpretations are debatable.

9. The Silent Gate

The Inner City’s south gate is flanked on each side by a
statue of an angel with a finger raised to its lips in a gesture
of silence.
City watch: The gate is manned by 2d6 soldiers of the city
watch at any given time (see The City Watch, p129).

City watch: 1d6 soldiers of the city watch are present at
the market at any given time (see The City Watch, p129).

11. The Chateau (Inn)

A grandiose, 4-storey inn with a black wooden frame
and painted wooden panels in the style of a rustic manor
house. The Chateau is known as the city’s second finest
inn—despite the continued efforts of the proprietors, its
reputation is one of affected luxury, rather than the true
class of its rival, The Bitter Rose.
Sign: A unicorn atop a knoll, eating a pomegranate.
Private dining rooms: There is no public bar or common
room. Guests are seated in private, waited rooms.
Music room: A small auditorium with deep carmine wallpaper and dainty chairs upholstered in floral silk. It is here
that guests socialise between performances. The proprietor, Drouge Underhill, can be met here, flitting between
favoured guests.
Guests: Flashy merchants, wealthy dilettantes, upcoming
musicians and singers, foppish minor nobles and their
fawning entourages.

Services at the Chateau
Lodgings and food: Of fancy quality (DPB).
Concerts in the music room: Cost 5–10gp per evening,
depending on the musicians performing.

Drouge Underhill—The Chateau Proprietor

with a beauty mark, and his moustache fashionably
curled.
Demeanour (Neutral): Fawning, utterly vapid yet
somehow engaging. Overly tactile.
Speech: Rapid, nasal, jittery. Woldish.

watch at any given time (see The City Watch, p129).

Lady Periwinkle—Guildmistress of the
Shadow House (Level 11 Magician)
A wan, wide-eyed human woman apparently in her 20s,
dressed in elegant courtly gowns and adorned with
a profusion of pearls. Her delicate, perfectly formed
visage and lustrous silver locks enchant those who look
upon her. If the guildmistress has a first name, none
know it.
Demeanour (Neutral): Distant, distracted, flashes of
blazing wit. Fleeting eye contact.
Speech: Demure yet firm. Woldish, Old Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: The arcane secrets of Ygraine (p84). The

13. The Shadow House

Home to the city’s only commercially-minded guild of
magicians, whose services are available for hire, to the
wealthy. The Shadow House appears to be an amalgamation of random parts of several smaller buildings of clashing styles. One side features a great astrological clock.
Public entrance: A tall, tiled porch stands at the front of the
House, but there is no visible door inside. A brass imp’s face
addresses visitors, asking their business and arranging
meetings (see Services, below).
Secret entrance: Guildmembers are instructed in magical
words and gestures that open a shadowy portal at the rear
of the building.
Interior: A bewildering maze of wood-panelled corridors,
dingy libraries, magical laboratories, and oddly-dimensioned conference rooms. The Shadow House is certainly
larger inside than it seems from the outside.

14. The Bitter Rose (Inn)

Once the home of a minor noble, this old-fashioned
wooden manor now acts as the city’s fanciest inn.
Sign: A white rose atop a rosy cross, heraldic style.
Common room: The manor’s former feasting hall, now
furnished with discreetly spaced tables, candles, silver
cutlery, and leather-upholstered seating. Musicians play
tastefully subdued tunes from a balcony. Tables are attentively served by manor-trained waiting staff under the
watchful eye of Hadle Butterwheeve, the butler.
Guests: Rich merchants and minor nobles, accompanied
by a smattering of bodyguards (on their best behaviour).
Private dining rooms: Converted studies and smoking
rooms on the ground floor, as well as a single large hall on
the second floor, the latter sufficient for 30 guests.
Secret passage to the Frolicke: A brick-walled passage
leads from the inn’s wine cellar into The Frolicke (p135).
Entry to the passage is barred by a locked gate (Hadle
Butterwheeve has the key). The existence of the passage
is known to the inn’s staff, but only the proprietors and the
butler know where it leads.
Proprietors: The Bitter Rose is owned by a wealthy
merchant family who keep their identity well-guarded.

Services at the Bitter Rose
Lodgings and food: Of fancy quality (DPB).
Rare wines: The Bitter Rose has one of the finest wine
cellars in the duchy and always has all the wines listed in
the Dolmenwood Player’s Book in stock.
The ducal suite: One extra-luxurious suite of rooms is kept
aside for visiting nobility, who book its use via the duke’s
butler. Characters who appear reputable and invest at least
100gp in palm greasing may be able to book directly at the
inn. The suite costs 20gp per night.
Portrait painting: Available at a cost of 500gp, performed
over a series of 1d6+6 days by an artist sanctioned by the
inn.

Hadle Butterwheeve—Bitter Rose Butler

Inhabitants: Half a dozen guildmembers lodge in attic
suites. Lady Periwinkle, the enigmatic mistress of the
guild, dwells in a sub-dimensional manor accessible from
the cellars.

A portly human man in his late forties, with prodigious
mutton chops, beady eyes, and a petulantly protruding
lower lip. His tailored black attire is the picture of tasteful modesty. His only indulgence is his fastidiously
preened hair.

Services at the Shadow House

Demeanour (Lawful): Scrupulously mannered,
perfectly timed. Habitually bows.

The guild-magicians always meet with prospective clients
in private rooms at The Chateau.
Detect magic: Detection of magic on an item costs 25gp
and takes 1d4 days. (The item in question must be left at
the House.)

Speech: Slow, painfully courteous rumbling. Woldish.
Desires: To expand his collection of taxidermied trottelings. Privately wishes to know more about his enigmatic employers.

Permanent enchantments: The guild places permanent
magicks of warding and detection for wealthy clients (principally merchants). Their consultation fee for such jobs is
100gp and the fees for actual magic begin at 500gp.

15. Royal Institute of
Physicks and Sorcerers

An imposing, ecclesiastical-looking building of dark stone
with a red tiled roof and two pointy towers. This is the
farthest flung outpost of a magicians’ guild of some influence in the wider kingdom beyond Dolmenwood—the
pompously titled Royal Institute of Physicks and Sorcerers.
The institute has the honour of being the only magic guild
officially sanctioned by the nobility.
Entrance: Grand steps lead up to a simple arched gateway
and a door of unblemished black metal. Closer scrutiny
reveals minute runes engraved in spirals upon the arch.
Interior: Chilly flagstoned passages, sprawling libraries,
cosy studies warmed by enchanted purple flames, secluded
alchemical laboratories. A profusion of odd statues lurks
in nooks and corners and upon high plinths. Visitors get
the feeling that they are being observed.
Inhabitants: Four lecturers (including Professor Edwynne
Woglemain, the divination master and head of the college),
a dozen apprentices, and a handful of servants.
Affiliated to the duke: The college operates as a private
centre of education and research, funded by the duke, who
occasionally requires the services of gentleman magicians.

The Feast Hall
A grand meeting hall lined with portraits of mysterious
and hoary magicians of yore. It is here that novices are
initiated into the guild, swearing allegiance to one of four
schools as directed by the faces in the portraits, which
animate and speak upon such occasions. The hall is never
used for dining.

The Heptagrammic Vault
Concealed in the cellars of the institute is a secret vault
where forbidden magicks of summoning and dimensional
travel are explored. A demon is currently trapped here.

Professor Edwynne Woglemain
(Level 10 Magician)
An ambitious, scheming human man in his fifties,
dressed in purple felt, with a white beard to his belly.
His beak-like nose and intensely peering eyes lend him
a hawkish air. Wears half-moon spectacles.
Demeanour (Neutral): Cold, obsessive, only wishes to
speak with those of great intellect.
Speech: Precise and succinct. Woldish, Old Woldish,
Sylvan, Caprice, a smattering of otherworldly tongues.
Desires: Knowledge of other worlds. To convince the
duke that the rumours of black magic conducted at
the institute are untrue. To enlist the aid of his former
colleague, Madame Thornwaife (see hex 1905) in
constructing demon-binding chains.

16. Fool’s Row

Following King’s Highway into Castle Brackenwold and
through the Sunken Gate, one comes to a breezy plaza
known colloquially as Fool’s Row.
Heroic statues: The plaza is lined with statues of beloved
heroes of fable. Included are Sir Windlass, said to have
saved the town of Prigwort from the terrors of a wyrm,
and Sir Chyde, hero of the wars against the Cold Prince and
slayer of the fairy giant Butter-for-Bones.
Entertainers: At the feet of the statues, teeming swaths of
jugglers, fire-breathers, sword-eaters, animal tamers, and
conjurers ply their trade.
City watch: 1d6 soldiers of the city watch are present at
Fool’s Row at any given time (see The City Watch, p129).
Autumnal parade: On the 7th of Reedwryme, in the early
days of autumn, the statues of Fool’s Row are hoisted onto
wagons and carried through the city streets in a parade
known affectionately as the Fools’ Feast. The people of each
district wave banners cheering on their favoured hero.

17. The Sunken Gate

The east gate to the Inner City is (due to a long-forgotten
quirk of planning) located beneath the wall. A stairway
descends 20′ on either side of the wall, leading to a broad
tunnel with the portcullised gate at its middle.
City watch: The gate is manned by 2d6 soldiers of the city
watch at any given time (see The City Watch, p129).

18. Well Gardens

Fancy public gardens, where well-to-do couples stroll on
sunny days and love-struck poets compose odes.
Wishing well: A disused city well, now used as a wishing
well, is found in an inconspicuous corner of the gardens.
At the base of its long shaft, the faint glimmer of water and
precious coins can be glimpsed.
Swan fountain: The centrepiece of the gardens is an
extravagant, tiered marble fountain carved with a multitude of swans’ heads.
City watch: 1d3 soldiers of the city watch are present in the
gardens at any given time (see The City Watch, p129). The
guards do not look kindly on attempts to pilfer coins from
the wishing well.

21. The Poppy Cock (Inn)

A dishevelled building of tarred planks with a huge weather-cock on the point of its roof. The Poppy Cock is an infamous den of gamblers, smugglers, cutpurses, and harlots.
Sign: A busty maiden wrestling with a rooster.
Common room: A winding, low-roofed room, narrowing
almost to a corridor in places, packed with rickety stools.
The place reeks with the bonfire aroma of Burglar’s Blend
pipeleaf (DPB). The bar, staffed by the landlady One-Eyed
Gil and her gang of barmaids, is crammed into a poky
corner, near overflowing with kegs and stacked bottles.

19. The Frolicke

The slopes of Clod’s Seat (p128) are devoted to scrupulously cultivated woods and gardens where nobles come
to frolic and pontificate. The woods can only be accessed
from within the castle; there is no public entry from the
Inner City.
The banshee: A hideous bronze statue of a howling old
woman stands in a sequestered grove. It is depicts Duchess
Phespherine, who was drowned in a pool in the Frolicke
four centuries ago and whose spirit is said to haunt the
woods still.
Secret passage to the Bitter Rose: A hidden trapdoor at the
foot of a statue of a surprised merman leads, via a secret
passage, to the cellars of the Bitter Rose (p133), known
to but a handful of individuals.
Ducal guards: Soldiers dressed in shining plate mail,
purple capes, and unicorn-topped helmets patrol the
gardens. 2d4 are stationed at any given time. Treat as Level
3 fighters (DMB).

20. Herb Gardens

Neat rows of medicinal herbs, fastidiously maintained by
the monks of the Seminary of 100 Martyrs (p131).
St Wort’s tree: A dilapidated old yew tree grows at the
centre of the gardens. The seminary’s herbalist, the retired
friar Mistress Waldefroum, can be found of an afternoon,
sitting in quiet contemplation upon a worn wooden bench
beneath its eaves.

Guests: A rowdy, heaving mix of thieves, thugs, and mercenaries.
Card rooms: One ground floor wing is dedicated to a collection of gloomy side-rooms where gamblers congregate and
schemes are made. The regulars only welcome strangers
they can swindle or rob.

The Thieves’ Guild
The Poppy Cock is a regular haunt of Castle Brackenwold’s
thieves’ guild. Anyone familiar with the appropriate
gestures and code phrases (e.g. Player Character thieves)
can make acquaintances in the common room with ease.

Services at the Poppy Cock
Lodgings and food: Of poor quality (DPB).
Pipeleaf: All common and uncommon varieties of leaf can
be purchased from pedlars in the common room.

One-Eyed Gil—Poppy Cock Landlady
(Level 4 Thief)
A wiry-framed human woman in her late thirties,
with cropped black hair, a dozen earrings, and both
eyes intact. (She and the regulars mockingly refuse
to explain the origin of her nickname.) Her arms are
adorned with tattoos of burly breggles. Gil is an erstwhile pickpocket and a member of the thieves’ guild.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Brash, cool-headed. Feigned
drunkenness.
Speech: Snarling, habitually shouts. Woldish.

An elderly human woman with a wobbly pot-belly and
eyes like merrily gleaming jewels. Walks with a stick.

Desires: Information on the layout of the Ducal Keep
(p130) and any weaknesses in its defences. To insinuate herself deeper into the trust of Sanctus Primus
(p71)—with whom she has a clandestine relationship—and subtly elicit secrets. To become mistress of
the thieves’ guild.

Demeanour (Lawful): Patient, inquisitive. Benevolent
smile. Rubs her sore knees and back.

Possessions: A poisoned stiletto concealed in the sole
of her boot.

Mistress Hanctra Waldefroum—Seminary
Herbalist (Level 8 Friar)

Speech: Wavering, meandering, filled with reminiscences. Grumbles good-naturedly about her back pains.
Woldish, Liturgic, Old Woldish.
Desires: Rare herb and fungus varieties (willing to
purchase with Church funds).
Companions: The master herbalist is normally accompanied by two over-cautious aides, whom she shushes
away when she wishes to speak with others.

dapper woollens and tweed. Many species of Cobbins live

The Grey League—Resistance Movement

n idyllic-seeming village situated at a bend in the
River Shiver, in the Valley of Wise Beasts. Most
of the buildings in the village are quaint little
houses of wood, half human size, with charmingly carved
and painted gables. Mingled among them are a number of
treehouses, stilt-houses (beside the river), and a few larger
buildings of stone (located around the village square).

Ruler: The village is within the dominion of Atanuwë
(p45), under the totalitarian rule of the crookhorn
Baron Fragglehorn (p46) and his band of ruffians from
his tower in hex 1004.
Religion: The animals of Cobton worship Atanuwë (p45)
as lord of all creation. The villagers refer to their master as
the Nag-Lord, not knowing of its other names.
Rumours: See Rumours in Cobton-on-the-Shiver, p444.

Atanuwë as Lord of Creation
Upon taking up lordship of the abandoned reaches of
northern Dolmenwood, Atanuwë decided it needed servitors and worshippers. It created the crookhorns to do its
bidding in war, but also saw fit to awaken sentience in the
woodland animals of the nearby valley. The animals—
given humanoid form and intelligence—were to serve
merely as adoring worshippers. Several centuries later, the
Cobbins of the Valley of Wise Beasts worship the Nag-Lord
as master of all creation, as they know nothing of the world
beyond the Valley.

Former Human Settlement
Cobton was built upon the ruins of a human settlement
which had lain derelict and overgrown for untold centuries. Atanuwë tasked the newly awakened Cobbins with
clearing the ruins and building a village for their own kind
there, in mockery of the proud creations of humankind.

The Tyranny of the Crookhorns
Upon first impression, all in Cobton seems well. Animals
merrily go about their business, fishing, sailing little boats,
making and mending, smoking pipes and drinking tea.
In truth, however, the inhabitants of the Valley live under
the totalitarian rule of the crookhorn Baron Fragglehorn (p46) and his band of ruffians. Daily communal
worship of the Nag-Lord is enforced, and it is illegal (on
pain of death!) for any Cobbin to leave the Valley. While the
majority of Cobbins simply wish to lead a quiet life and stay
out of trouble, a rebellion is brewing—see The Grey League.

Purpose: A secret (and blasphemous) resistance movement against the tyranny of the Nag-Lord, with the
ultimate aim of expelling all crookhorns from Cobton.
Membership: After a recent backlash, the League is
reduced to three mice, a badger, and two water voles, in
addition to their leader, Wallobry Trundlehorn.

Wallobry Trundlehorn—Grey League Leader
An old mole lady with twinkling eyes and a grey patch
on her head. Dresses in ill-fitting woollens and a floppy,
floral hat.
Demeanour (Lawful): Timid, principled. Looks at the
ground when speaking.
Speech: Hesitant mumbling. Woldish, Gaffe.
Desires: All crookhorns expelled from the Valley. To
marry the innkeeper, Smunkey O’Brady (p138).

Illegal to Bear Arms
The bearing of anything more threatening than a dagger
or a stout staff is banned in Cobton. Transgressors quickly
attract the attentions of the crookhorn guards.

Reaction to Outsiders
Visitors from beyond the Valley are a once-in-a-lifetime
event for the residents of Cobton. Strangers rapidly come
to the attention of the crookhorn village guard, who try to
imprison or expel them.

Equipment Availability

All items for sale in Cobton are sized for Cobbins—approximately half human size. Weapons larger than a dagger
are not available (except in secret, to trusted friends of
the smith—see p139). Mounts and armour cannot be
bought in Cobton.

Briggsy Bugber—Crookhorn Guard Captain

Sign: A portrait of Atanuwë, depicted (as is traditional in
the Valley) with white fur, purple horn, pink mane, a toothy
smirk, and seven eyes in a row.

Demeanour (Chaotic): Brutal, utterly humourless.

A human-height ground floor of ancient stone, augmented
with a miniature upper floor in red-varnished wood. The
King’s Head is the social nexus of the village.

Common room: Cheery and spotlessly clean. Miniature
(half human size) tables are decked with embroidered
tablecloths and lace doilies, and ringed with dainty stools
carved with sylvan scenes. Little cast iron lanterns hang
from the human-height (8′) ceiling, lending a warm, flickering glow to the space. Rocking chairs with cosy cushions stand in the corners. The landlord, Smunkey O’Brady,
serves from a bar stacked with shiny brass tankards.
Guests: Cobbins of all species, drinking, singing, and dancing upon tables. Crookhorn guards poke their heads in
periodically.

Services at the King’s Head
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB). Only
Cobbin-sized beds are available. Medium characters may
be offered a cramped space in the common room.
Shiverston ale: The only drink served is the local brew

prayer. Briggsy Bugber acts as priest, bearing a viciously
spiked ceremonial mace and wearing a cloak studded with
hundreds of horns.

their four children. All are in the thrall of the harpy, Old
Madame Whipthorn, who lives secreted in their cellar.
Harpy in the cellar: A secret door in the mill’s cellar leads

Old Madame Whipthorn, a servant of Atanuwë placed
here as a spy.

Dreg and
Shantywood Isle
1110—Rowdy
1110
—Rowdy Hameth port-town and the neighbouring isle of ill-repute.

A

Brother Rodger Hogbeard (Level 3 Friar)

Inhabitants (300—village): A majority of humans of High
Woldish descent have plied the river here for many generations, alongside a smaller population of shorthorns. As a
centre of trade and transit, Dreg is also home to a significant population of folk from other regions.

Demeanour (Neutral): Magnetic, wide-eyed religious fervour. (Hogbeard was previously Lawful, but
the Atacorn’s influence has swayed him to increasing
passion and violence.)

rough port-town and fishing village founded
amid the marshes and mists of the River
Hameth’s banks. Tall, wonky houses are clad
with tarred wooden planks against the damp. The place is
slumping inexorably into the bog and the river. Dreg has
a seedy reputation as a haunt for thieves, charlatans, and
rascals of all stripes.

A plump, red-faced human man in his fifties, with bushy
beard and eyebrows. Dressed in the hessian robes and
tonsure of a friar, with a Chapes swinging from a chain
around his neck. Hogbeard came to Dreg five years ago,
to aid the poor, but has become the leader of a band of
religious vigilantes who dispense justice in the town.

Ruler: Dreg is notionally ruled by Lord Malbleat (p64)
and his representative in the village, the Berkmaster
Monocleese (p143—a mayor of sorts). Madame Shantywood (p145), although she has no legally recognised
position in Dreg, practically runs the port, due to her
economic clout.

Speech: Bombastic, doom-laden. Woldish, Liturgic.

Religion: Ostensibly devotees of the Church, the rowdy
folk of Dreg have a tendency towards godlessness. The
rogue friar Brother Hogbeard and his flock of yellowsmocked zealots seek to reverse this trend.

Yellow-smocked converts to Hogbeard’s cause who
patrol the town, preaching the word of the Pluritine
Church. Of late, the zealots have taken to kidnapping
“sinners” for nighttime exorcism in the woods.

Rumours: See Rumours in Dreg and Shantywood Isle,
p445.

The River Trade
The River Hameth runs wide and shallow at this point and
is rich with fish and floating debris from the forest. Boats
and barges carry goods and passengers along two routes:
East-west: The 7-mile river journey between Dreg and
the Woodcutters’ Encampment forms a vital link in the
trade route between Castle Brackenwold (in the east) and
High-Hankle and Lankshorn (in the west).
North-south: Trade between Dolmenwood and the lands
to the south travels along the Hameth, via Dreg, the Woodcutters’ Encampment, and the wondrous ship-conveyor at
the Falls of Nyf (see hex 1112).

The Atacorn’s Miasma
Unknown to the people of Dreg, an Atacorn—one of the
spawn of Atanuwë—has dwelt hidden in the town for some
years, infusing the town’s smoked fish with its corrupting miasma (see Crewithyant, p144). As a result of the
Atacorn’s insidious influence, violence, treachery, and
discord are on the rise in Dreg.
Reaction Rolls: The supernatural aura of discord incurs a
–1 penalty to all Reaction Rolls in Dreg.

140

Desires: For Dreg to be freed of sin. To be recognised by
the Church for his holy deeds and be decreed a living
saint.

Hogbeard’s Zealots

Famed Bog-Swine Sausages
Dreg is known for its fine sausages, made from the flesh of
the swine kept in the bogs to the north of the village. The
bog-swine of Dreg are huge, bristly, black creatures fed on
detritus from the river.

Shantywood Isle
A cliff-sided island divides the River Hameth for a quarter
of a mile. The island has long been inhabited and its surface
consists of gentle woods and pleasure gardens surrounding the fabulous Chateau Shantywood—a notorious manor
of ill-repute. Two coves give access, via steep stairways, to
the interior.
By a quirk of legal history, the island is technically an independent country and has the right to arbitrate its own laws.
(In practice, the law is dictated by the whims of Madame
Shantywood.)

Equipment Availability

Vehicles and mounts cost 50% more than usual. Despite
Dreg’s status as a village, mercenary companies can
occasionally be hired here (2-in-6 chance, see Specialist
Services, DPB).

more than a cottage, but is homely and well maintained.
The inn is known colloquially as the “Mermaid’s Arse.”
Sign: A mermaid on the seashore, bashfully hiding her
modesty with her immaculately braided blonde hair.
Common room: Dark beams, floorboards decked with
round woollen rugs, the scent of wood polish, and a cheery
fireplace conjure an atmosphere at once welcoming and
intimate. A sign reads “No gambling, lewdness, or sea
shanties!” Customers are served by Ogham Tweede, the
bartender.

1-in-6 chance per evening of the inn’s proprietor, Tamrin
Tweede, sitting in a corner drinking quietly by herself.

nighttime bath to filch whatever pittance lies in the pool.
“Pool dredger” is a common insult in Dreg.

5. Berkmaster’s Manor

A tall, ungainly building clad with stained wood shingles
and topped with a teetering bell tower. The manor is an odd
structure that has been extended many times by Berkmasters over the centuries.
Raised on stilts: The current Berkmaster’s predecessor,
envious of Madame Shantywood’s power and influence,
had the manor raised up on high stilts, setting it directly
facing Chateau Shantywood, across the river.
The berk-bell: A great, goat-faced copper bell shines at the
summit of the manor’s bell tower. A hereditary bell-polisher buffs it daily, but it is only rung upon the arrival of a
longhorn noble in Dreg.
Inhabitants: The current Berkmaster is Maximilian Monocleese (“His Lordship”) lives here with his sickly wife Hilda.
The title of Berkmaster is bestowed by the lord of Dreg

oiled and curled black hair. Dresses in black silk shirts
and slacks and wears the silver fish’s head medallion
hereditary to his station. Monocleese considers himself
nobility, although none of noble blood would concur.

numerous sailors who find themselves in Dreg for a night.
The cheapest place to stay in town, but hazardous for
non-sailors.
Sign: A leering moon ringed with grimacing stars.
Common room: A draughty hall, rammed with a jumble of
rickety stools. An old fishing boat hangs from the rafters,
keel down, its nets dangling at head height, festooned with

Guests: Itinerant sailors and barge-folk. Raucous sea shanties and tussles over dice games are regular fixtures, of an
evening.

trouble in Shodgerey’s. Outsiders who appear weak or
cultured may be targeted by louts or pickpockets.

Services at Shodgerey’s Shack
Hammocks: Guests sleep in a long, windowless hall, lined
with hammocks, nautical style. 2cp per night.
Food: Of poor quality (DPB).
Beverages: Only Pilston’s Heartbreaker (DPB) and (for

50% of the normal price. Only those the sailors take a shine
to are offered pipeleaf at this reduced rate. All common
pipeleafs can be found for sale here.

Lyren Shodgerey—Shodgerey’s Shack Landlord
A squat, muscular human man in his late thirties, with
a shaven head and half his teeth missing. Covered from

8. Church of St Wick

A mouldering wooden church beside the port, built upon
a pier above the river. The church is dedicated to St Wick
(patron saint of ferry-folk and amputees). The church’s
meagre size and poor state of repair indicate the esteem in
which the folk of Dreg generally hold organised religion.
Entrance: A once-solid door of oak, now weathered and
battered. The door is only unlocked during the mornings,
until the elderly vicar—Reverend Mother Hadlewreath—
retires for the day at lunch time.
Interior: Dusty, musty wooden walls and pews. A tarnished
pewter icon on the velvet-cloaked altar depicts St Wick
with eyes raised to heaven, impaled with a horrid array of
spears, arrows, and axes.
Populace: A handful of pious locals. Reverend Mother
Hadlewreath sits to one side, reading.
Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of
St Wick: the ability to cast Greater Healing. See Shrines,

a rusted iron chimney. The smokehouse is a communally
owned facility for preserving fish by smoking.

racks of various sizes are stored in extensive cellars
beneath the smokehouse.
The polluter in the dark: Unknown to the folk of Dreg,
the Atacorn Crewithyant—spawn of the Nag-Lord—lurks
in the dark recesses of the smokehouse cellars. After dark,
the Atacorn dissolves into a gaseous form and infuses the
smoking fish in his corrupting miasma (see The Atacorn’s
Miasma, p140). During the day, he sleeps.

Crewithyant—Atacorn
A naked, emaciated, gangly (6′ tall) man-thing with

Reverend Mother Shandra Hadlewreath—
Vicar of Dreg
An elderly, flabby human woman with fluffy white hair

Sign: A bright pink salmon leaping out of a stream, its
mouth gaping after a dangling sausage pie.

The smell of roasting meat wafts from the grill at one end,
mingling with the reek of pipesmoke. A stage at the other
end of the room frequently hosts bawdy performances.
Viewing balcony: For an entrance fee of 2sp, one may
ascend to the balcony that overlooks the common room.
The balcony is served by its own bar and features plush
leather couches. The landlord, Sidley Crump, often surveys

Current scheme: The leader, Brigg, believes (incorrectly) that Berkmaster Monocleese (p143) plans to
sacrifice his wife to a coven of evil witches in return for
a demon servitor. The Boghouse Boys plan to infiltrate
the Berkmaster’s manor, rescue the poor lady, and bring
the Berkmaster and the witches to justice.

Brigg “Hollowhand” Meagre—Leader

13. North Cove

A broad, undecorated dock in a small cove at the north-eastern corner of Shantywood Isle, used for ferrying goods.
Stairs up: A steep stairway leads up the cliffside to the
servants’ entrance at the rear of Chateau Shantywood.
Guards: 2 soldiers (usually women, Level 1 fighters—DMB)
guard the dock at all hours, vetting arrivals.

14. Chateau Shantywood

A manse of ostentatious turrets and flamboyant minarets at the summit of Shantywood Isle. The chateau is a
much-frequented manor of ill-repute and home of the
seductive and ruthless Madame Shantywood.

A stocky, broad-shouldered human man in his late 30s,
with shaven head, mop-like beard, and one wooden
hand. Brigg owns one of the more profitable bog-swine
farms north of Dreg. Of late, his dreams have been
haunted by false visions of great evils afoot in Dreg (the
insinuations of the Atacorn Crewithyant, see p140).

Common room: A stone-flagged hall with gaudy tapestries, crystal chandeliers, and a sea of gambling tables.
Scantily-clad wait staff serve tables.

Demeanour (Lawful): Quiet but firm. Shifty-eyed.

Ballroom: Exclusively reserved for well-to-do patrons
who wish to avoid the riff-raff. Elegant music accompanies
refined dances and dalliances.

Speech: Dour, conspiratorial. Woldish.
Desires: For Dreg to be ruled by common folk of good
sense and upstanding morality (e.g. himself).

11. The Boghouse

The shell of a burned-out farmhouse, now used as the
meeting house of a secret society who have dubbed the
ruin “the Boghouse” and themselves “the Boghouse Boys.”
Interior: Collapsed beams and the blackened remnants of
a few walls remain. Bracken and nettles crowd the space.
Tracks and secret trapdoor: Upon close examination of
the ruin, bootprints in the mud and a slight disturbance of
the undergrowth mark a subtle path to one corner. Under
a mound of carefully arranged rubble is a locked trapdoor.
Cellar: The ruin’s cellar is decked out as a secret meeting house, complete with twelve stools, a rickety table for
scheming at, a rough map of Dreg and the surrounding
woodland, a keg of ale, and a set of pewter tankards.
Inhabitants: In the day, the ruined farmhouse is empty. At
night, there is a 3-in-6 chance of 2d6 local menfolk (“the
Boghouse Boys”) hiding out in the cellars, scheming.

12. South Cove

A small dock located in a wide cove in the cliff-ringed
Shantywood Isle. Boats other than the barges operated by
Madame Shantywood are not permitted to land directly.
Red banners: Banners bearing Madame Shantywood’s coat
of arms—seven golden coins encircling a black rose—hang
from the cliff walls.
Stairs up: A steep stairway leads up the cliffside to the
island’s interior and the fabulous Chateau Shantywood.
Barges to Dreg: Seductively attired employees of Madame
Shantywood operate red-lanterned barges ferrying passengers back and forth from Dreg, free of charge. The barges
only operate during the evening and night.

Guests: Boorish, drunken locals, ogling at the staff. A smattering of wealthy merchants, minor nobility, and successful adventurers.

Services at Chateau Shantywood
Lodgings and food: Lodgings of fancy quality, food of
common quality (DPB).
Companionship: The private company of staff in Madame
Shantywood’s employ can be bought from 5sp per hour.

Madame Chandilore Shantywood
A bewitching human woman approaching 50, with cascading, raven locks and eyes
of striking green. Dresses in an antiquated
style, with black lace dress, layered petticoats,
tightly strung corset, and heavily powdered face. As
Lady of Shantywood Isle (a hereditary position passed
from mother to daughter), she is the wealthy ruler of
an independent micro-domain.
Demeanour (Neutral): Self-assured, calculating. Has
a taste for cruelty. Merciless in punishing those who
cross her. Habitually gazes into an ivory hand mirror,
reapplying her face powder with a feathery puff.
Speech: Eminently refined, mischievously demeaning,
callously frank. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: The amorous attentions of the sorceress Myrrsian (hex 1110), whom she has spied in the ballroom on
occasion. The painful death of Lord Murkin (p65)
who slew her eldest daughter many years ago. To keep
the identity of her children’s father (the gentleman in
the mirror—see Possessions) secret.
Possessions: A magic mirror granting access to a dusty,
dreamy shadow manse ruled by a spectral gentleman.
Family: Two adult daughters—Heremine and Ayla.
Servants: 12 soldiers (mostly women), several dozen
hospitality staff.

Fort Vulgar
0604—Trading
0604
—Trading and military outpost on the haunted shores of Lake Longmere.

A

teeming, ramshackle dock, along with a cluster
of buildings, located at the point where Quogg’s
Creek flows into the haunted Lake Longmere. An
old stone keep ringed with a dilapidated palisade stands on
the cliffs above the docks, overlooking the lake.
Inhabitants (90—village): The inhabitants of the keep
itself, a handful of permanent residents around the docks,
plus a transient population of traders, fishers, and bargefolk. It is common to see people from the realm to the
north of Dolmenwood here.
Ruler: Sir Osric the Gaunt (p149), a vassal of the Duke of
Brackenwold (p58). The Dockmaster (p148) and the
Vulgar Knights act as law enforcement.
Religion: Sailors and river-folk tend to be devout sorts,
happy to propitiate both the saints of the Pluritine Church
and an assortment of folk-deities and spirits of the water.
Origin of the name: The name “Fort Vulgar” is a contraction of the name of the keep—Vulgular.
Rumours: See Rumours in Fort Vulgar, p446.

Ancient Watch-Keep
Keep Vulgular was originally constructed following the
banishment of the Cold Prince, 850 years ago (see History,
p14). With views from its towers across Lake Longmere
to Hoarblight Keep (the erstwhile palace of the Cold Prince),
it kept a watch for the fairy lord’s return.

The Lake Monster, Big Chook
Once serene and plied by a multitude of ships, Lake Longmere is now home to a horrible lake monster known as
Big Chook. First sightings of the monster date back to 400
years ago, shortly after the coming of the Nag-Lord to
Dolmenwood (see History, p14). All who travel along
the lakeside fear the mind-melting, cockerel-like wailings
of the beast—doubly so those who, like the residents of Fort
Vulgar, dwell beside Longmere.

The Chookers—Victims of the Big Chook
A close encounter with Big Chook is usually fatal for mortal
folk. There are a few, however, who avoid being eaten alive
and manage to escape. Such people often become wildeyed obsessives, bewitched by the accursed monster they
encountered. A number of these hapless folk frequent
Fort Vulgar, irresistibly drawn to shores where they may
catch snippets of the monster’s song. The locals call them
“Chookers.”

146

The Realm to the North
Fort Vulgar is an important stopping point on the trade
route between the Duchy of Brackenwold and the realm
that lies to the north, beyond the haunted Table Downs.
The Referee may determine the nature of the northerners who make their way south to Fort Vulgar and the
goods that they carry, if extending play to the north of
Dolmenwood.

The River Trade
Trade between the Duchy of Brackenwold and the realm
to the north principally flows via boats and barges along
Quogg’s Creek. In olden times, these boats would traverse
Lake Longmere and pass along the Lower Hameth to the
Woodcutters’ Encampment and Dreg. Nowadays, however,
goods transported from the north are unloaded at Fort
Vulgar onto wagons for transport on to Prigwort via the
Fort Road. Since the coming of the lake monster Big Chook,
none of sound mind ply the waters of Lake Longmere.

Tentacle Tattoos
Many of the barge-folk and dock workers sport a tattoo
of a black tentacle coiled around one forearm. Outsiders
sometimes mistake this as the sigil of an imagined insidious cult. In fact, the tattoos are a tradition and mark of
pride among the barge-folk who frequent Fort Vulgar (see
The Chook’s Nob, p148) and have no sinister meaning.

Equipment Availability

Weapons and armour cost 50% more than usual. Vehicles
and mounts are not generally available, though adventurers willing to pay 5 times the going rate may be able to
persuade a merchant or trader to part with their transport.

and bear longswords and lances. Each is accompanied
by a squire.
Names: Sir Bastian, Sir Chortle, Sir Hadrian, Sir Lythe,
and Sir Osquip.
Arrival on the scene: If trouble breaks out, the Dockmaster (p148) and 1d3 knights and squires arrive
within 1d12 minutes (1d4 Turns at night). The remaining
knights and squires arrive 10 minutes later (1d4 Turns
later at night), if reinforcements are called for.

1. Trade Square

A cobblestoned square where goods are traded and
unloaded from boats onto wagons and vice versa, via
a set of creaky winches on the eastern side of the dock.
While the square does not host a market as such, traders
are happy to sell goods to the occasional passing traveller.

2. Docks

A widened bay at the river’s mouth, with piers and mooring
points for trade vessels to dock. Rope ladders lead 15′ up
from the piers to land level. On the eastern side of the dock,
larger platforms with winches allow goods to be lifted.
Chappily bridge: Spans the river at the docks, its support
posts as thick as tree trunks.
Chook gate: A rusty gate spans the width of the river mouth
at the docks, barring further travel and—more importantly—preventing anything unsavoury entering the
docks from the lake. A portal in the centre can be opened
to allow access to the lake when occasionally required.
Taxation: All goods loaded or unloaded are subject to a
5% tax, levied by one of Sir Osric’s knights (see The Vulgar
Knights, p147), who watch from the Tax Tower.
Boat travel northwards: Passage on a boat to the old dock
beside Avernal Lake (hex 0802) can be bought for 1gp.
The journey takes 10 hours. The cost of travel onward to
the realm north of Dolmenwood is left for the Referee to
decide, if they wish to extend play to the north.

3. Tax Tower

A squat, two-storey tower of pale pinkish-white stone with
a pointed, tiled roof, flying a black pennant.
Knights and squires: 1d4 knights and their squires (see The
Vulgar Knights, p147) are stationed here during the day,
practicing combat manoeuvres on the riverbank and keeping an eye out for incoming traders along the river or road.
At night, 1d3 squires are stationed in the tower as lookouts.
Interior: A feasting table, well-stocked pantry, and strongbox on the lower floor. Spartan lodgings on the upper floor.

4. The Chook’s Nob (Inn)

An old wooden warehouse building with a tarred roof, now
converted into a makeshift tavern and flophouse. On one
side, a deck with barrels for tables and benches overlooks
the docks.
Sign: A green, scaly tentacle, severed and nailed to a board,
oozing purple blood.
Common room: A lofty warehouse space with clusters
of stools carelessly scattered throughout. No tables. The
place is constantly filled to the brim with pipe-smoke. The
landlady, Brewigg Shankwolde, wanders among guests,
carrying a huge jug of crabble (see below).
Guests: Rough barge-folk (including folk from the realm
to the north) arm-wrestling and singing raucous sea shanties. The occasional merchant or trader, uncomfortably
attempting to go unnoticed.

148

Brewigg Shankwolde—Chook’s Nob Proprietor
A burly shorthorn woman with coarse, ginger fur, eyes
of unusual deep red, foot-long chin-locks, and one fanglike tooth. Keeps one forearm shaved, proudly revealing the tattooed tentacle coiling around it.
Demeanour (Neutral): Gruff, slow-witted. Eyes guests
suspiciously, but is eager to talk to outsiders.
Speech: Strongly Gaffe-accented, frequent pauses while
she gathers her thoughts. Woldish, Gaffe.
Desires: News from the High Wold (her land of origin).

Services at the Chook’s Nob
Lodgings and food: Of poor quality (DPB). The inn has 4
private rooms available for 1gp per night. Other guests
must sleep on the common room floor.
Dockmaster’s marmalade: Jars of sour crab apple jam,
sweetened with lashings of honey badger slime (see
Animals, DMB). An acquired taste. 3gp a jar.
Crabble: Wince-inducingly sour crab apple cider fermented
in the inn’s cellars. 4cp a mug.
Tattoos: It is customary among the barge-folk to have a
tentacle tattooed coiling around one’s forearm upon first
visiting Fort Vulgar. Adventurers are encouraged to do
likewise. A traditional tentacle tattoo can be had for free
(accompanied by encouraging roaring from the crowd).
Other designs cost 5gp or more.

5. Dockmaster’s Cottage

The only lovingly maintained building in Fort Vulgar (and
thus looking completely out of place). The residence of
the dockmaster, Wiglow Bogleman, and her family is a
homely, thatched cottage with rustic roses rambling up
its sides.

Wiglow Bogleman—Dockmaster
A human woman in her fifties with long, straggling
hair, a portly frame, and many missing teeth. Sports
a threadbare purple skullcap and clutches a cudgel
topped with a carved wooden fist.
Demeanour (Lawful): Wary of foot travellers. Habitually casts worried glances at the lake.
Speech: Barely comprehensible rustic burr laced with
official-sounding nautical terms. Woldish.
Desires: Unusual fruits. The capture of Captain Snarkscorn (p46) and his cronies, who are hunting honey
badgers (DMB) in the region to near extinction.

Part Five | Set tlements

Father Edgar Drabe—Vicar of Fort Vulgar
A bald, chubby human man in his forties, with dull
brown eyes hiding behind tiny spectacles. The Father
lives in quarters in the keep and is on good terms with
Sir Osric.
Demeanour (Lawful): Well-intentioned, but somewhat
snooty. Socially awkward, especially with women.
Speech: Droning monologues punctuated with bursts
of nervous laughter. Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: Antique scriptures. A post in a more glamorous, cultured locale.

6. Chapel of St Dougan

A tall, narrow church made of vertical wooden posts with a
sloping slate roof. Set atop a hill overlooking the docks, the
chapel can be seen from all vantage points in Fort Vulgar.
Entrance: A weathered door of black-lacquered oak with
the desiccated remnants of innumerable apple cores (a
symbol of St Dougan) nailed upon it.
Interior: A windy, austere space with rickety, unornamented pews lined up before a monolithic altar of black
stone. Upon the altar stands an unassuming wooden
statue of the obscure minor saint, Dougan the Incredulous
(patron saint of night wardens and orchards).
Populace: God-fearing barge-folk, come to meekly pray for
luck on their journeys and forgiveness of their sins. The
local vicar, Father Edgar Drabe, disseminates beautifully
hand-lettered pamphlets of favoured scriptural verses to
any who can read.
Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of St
Dougan: the ability to cast Detect Disguise. See Shrines,
p22 and Uncommon Spells, p454.
Graveyard: A lonely graveyard is located behind the
chapel, on the border of the woods. The simple graves bear
a great diversity of names—those of the barge-folk and
soldiers who met their end here, far from home.

7. Soured Orchard

Old, unmaintained copses of pear and apple trees, now
twisted and hunchbacked. In the autumn, they bear sour
fruits, which locals gather.
Writhing soil: Passersby may notice unwholesome bloodred worms writhing among the roots of the trees. They are
eyeless but have tiny, human-like mouths and tongues.
Anyone touching the worms must Save Versus Doom or
be afflicted with sickness for 1d3 days (–2 to Attack Rolls
and Saving Throws).

8. Fort Palisade

A ramshackle wooden palisade surrounding Keep Vulgular
and its grounds. The palisade is in dire need of reinforcement and, in its current state, would provide little protection against concerted attack.

Sir Osric “the Gaunt” Hazelmire
(Level 9 Knight)
A human man renowned as the heartiest, most robust,
reddest-faced man in the duke’s service (his epithet is
ironic). His height and the curl of his moustaches are
equally famed. As vassal of the Duke of Brackenwold
(p58), Osric is responsible for collecting taxes from
all boats and barges travelling through Fort Vulgar.
Demeanour (Lawful): Brash, blustery, hot-tempered.
Robust back-slapping. Cranes his neck forward and
stares when awaiting an answer.
Speech: Toffish, inappropriately chummy. Woldish,
rusty Old Woldish.
Desires: Reconnaissance from the Nagwood. The head
of the crookhorn Captain Snarkscorn (p46), whose
minions harry the river trade along Quogg’s Creek. To
be granted free rein to hunt crookhorns in the woods.
The hand of Lady Mulbreck (p61), whom he has
admired from afar for years.

9. Keep Vulgular

An old, crumbling castle of great stone blocks, partly clad
in ivy. The chequered banner of House Brackenwold flies
proudly from the highest gable. Its tall towers and high
vantage point afford the keep excellent views across Lake
Longmere.
Keep grounds: Just inside the gate stands a large stable,
home to the beloved steeds of the keep’s knightly inhabitants. A grassy square with battered jousting targets is
spread before the keep, a meagre herb garden at its rear.
Interior: Frigid, dusty halls and chambers clad with motheaten tapestries, faded military maps, and damp carpets.
The excess of side-doors, cramped connecting passages,
and jumbled stacks of crates lends the place a bewildering,
maze-like quality.
Inhabitants: The fort is occupied by Sir Osric the Gaunt,
five mounted knights (see The Vulgar Knights, p147),
their squires and families, and a small retinue of boatmen
and domestic servants.
Guests: Sir Osric welcomes well-to-do merchants, any who
are affiliated with the Church or one of the noble houses
of Dolmenwood, as well as anyone bringing news from
the Nagwood. Guests are granted use of one of the keep’s
sumptuous (if somewhat dusty and ageing) suites.

10. Fort Road

A well-maintained, much-frequented trade road that leads
to Prigwort, past the ruins of the Abbey of St Clewyd.

11. Creek Path

A little-used hunter’s trail leading into the depths of the
forest, through the western edge of the Nagwood, and,
eventually, north to the accursed Table Downs.

Gate: A turreted gatehouse with a portcullis, usually kept
open during the day. Inhabited by the 1d3 squires (see The
Vulgar Knights, p147) who vet visitors.

High-Hankle
0512—Ancient
0512
—Ancient capital of the High Wold and burgeoning town of hedonism.
n ancient, thriving town that has formed the
heart of High Wold culture since days long since
forgotten. At its centre, within the great town
walls, the imposing baronial tower—Castle Perigonne—
surveys the windswept grasslands and rolling hills of the
southern High Wold.

A

The Walled Town

Inhabitants (5,300—large town): As a town of some
renown, High-Hankle is home to a diverse population of
local, curly-haired High Woldish folk, breggles, and a sizeable number of immigrants from throughout Dolmenwood
and beyond. Approximately half the population dwells
within the town walls and half without.

The Escalade

Ruler: The Baron Hogwarsh (p60) rules over High-Hankle and the surrounding High Wold region. The baron’s
disinterest in law and order has spurred, however, a rapid
waxing in the power of the thieves’ guild, led by the sinister
Bagsley Corundum (p153).
Religion: By and large, the folk of High-Hankle adhere to
the tenets of the Pluritine Church, with the resplendent
Three Martyrs Minster serving as their locus of worship.
Led by the Baron’s example, however, an irreligious mien
is en vogue among the youthful aristocracy.
Rumours: See Rumours in High-Hankle, p447.

Hangleton
Once a separate village that was gradually subsumed by
the town, Hangleton is the name now given to all parts
of High-Hankle that lie outside the town wall. It is here
that the majority of the town’s lower classes dwell, in a
jumble of cottages, workshops, market squares, and drinking establishments. At the town’s edge, Hangleton blends
into the farmland of the surrounding region.

The town’s artisan districts, garrisons, and higher class
entertainment venues are ringed with a hulking, fortified
wall of timeworn sandstone, carved with a multitude of
griffons and boars (symbols of House Hogwarsh).

A labyrinthine district of bridges, arches, and raised buildings built up over many centuries around the skirts of
Castle Perigonne, at the centre of the town. The Escalade
now consists of three stacked layers with stairways and
ramps providing access to the upper and middle layers.
Upper layer: Fancy establishments catering to the aristocracy and those with money to fritter.
Middle layer: Housing for servants and staff, workshops
of less affluent artisans.
Lower layer: Cellars and warehouses, with a small population of the utterly destitute dwelling in forgotten passages.

Town of Hedonism
Since the current baron’s ascent to power, High-Hankle’s
reputation is one of revelry, carousing, and debauchery
of all kinds. The town is now the favoured haunt of jaded
nobles, hedonists, and thrill-seekers from far and wide.

The Power of the Thieves’ Guild
Flourishing under the baron’s lax rule, the thieves’ guild of
High-Hankle has become a power to contend with. Seemingly every business of any import is now entangled in the
schemes of the guildmaster, Bagsley Corundum (p153).
The guild maintains its headquarters in secret chambers
in the lower layer of the Escalade.

Intrigues and Plots
The High Wold’s longhorn noble houses have long envied
the power of House Hogwarsh, to which they are subservient. Currently, Lord Ramius (p65) connives against
the reckless Hogwarsh, wishing to be declared baron of
the High Wold in his stead. Lord Malbleat (p61) curries
Hogwarsh’s favour, as a fellow aesthete, for aid in his
private war against Ramius. Lord Murkin (p65) dreams
of conquest, beginning with the lands of House Nodlock
and ending with the capture of High-Hankle. Spies are
numerous within the courts of Castle Perigonne.

Equipment Availability

In addition to the standard equipment and services listed
in the DPB, unusual, non-standard businesses can be
located with a little investigative work.

1. Castle Perigonne

A massive, dizzyingly tall tower of stone that looms over
High-Hankle. Its lower levels are now effectively subterranean, subsumed beneath the three layers of the Escalade
(p150).
Entrance: A grand stair, lined with scowling griffon statues,
leads from the upper layer of the Escalade to the black iron
gates of the castle. 2d4+6 baronial guards are stationed
here at all times (Level 3 fighters—DMB).
Ancient gate: The ancient granite gate of the castle is situated in the bowels of the Escalade’s lower layer. It is disused
and magically sealed, though it could provide a means of
escape from the castle in dire need.
Interior: Seemingly countless floors of luxurious suites,
dusty libraries and map rooms, taxidermy-bedecked
lounges, and opulent banquet halls. The castle’s subdued
tapestries and stately furnishings are rapidly being
replaced with a modish array of gaudy oil paintings, silk
upholstered couches, and garish carpets.
Inhabitants: The Baron Hogwarsh (p60), his doting
mother, the Dowager Baroness, his timorous brother,
Walter, and a staff of around 50 servants.

2. The Griffonry

The High-Hankle garrison—a squat keep with six crenellated towers, adjoining the lower levels of Castle Perigonne.

Lankshorn
0710—High
0710
—High Wold market town on the edge of the tangled, breggle-ruled woods.

A

bustling town of well-kept, stonebuilt houses,
clustered around a tall-steepled church and a
cobbled market square. At the rear of the town, a
slope rises towards Dolmenwood, which looms ominously,
a reminder of Lankshorn’s position on the verge of the
wild.
Inhabitants (1,100—small town): Mostly consisting of
local, curly-haired folk of High Woldish origin who have
made their livings in the town for many generations. A
number of breggles also dwell in Lankshorn.
Ruler: Lord Malbleat (p64) and Berkmaster Baldricke
(p159)—Malbleat’s representative in the town (a mayor
of sorts).
Religion: As the old and well-loved church of Saint
Pastery—located proudly in the town centre—attests, the
people of Lankshorn are devout followers of the Pluritine
Church. However, in addition to the tenets of the Church,
Lankshorners proudly follow a body of local superstitions.
Rumours: See Rumours in Lankshorn, p448.

Threshold to Dolmenwood
The northernmost settlement in the High Wold, Lankshorn lies within a bowshot of the forest’s border, acting
as one of the two main “thresholds” into Dolmenwood (the
other being Castle Brackenwold, in the east).

Wrested From Lord Ramius’ Domain
Twenty-two years ago, a feud among the nobles of House
Ramius led to an abrupt reshaping of traditional domain
boundaries in the High Wold (see House Ramius Divided,
p62). It was thus that Lankshorn was wrested overnight
from the domain of Lord Ramius and became part of the
newly established domain of Lord Malbleat.

Breggle Blood
Over many generations, the humans and breggles of Lankshorn have partially intermixed. Most Lankshorners show
no evidence of this mixed heritage, but the occasional goatlike feature can be noted among the human townsfolk.

Goat’s hoof in place of a hand.
Horn-like nubs on the forehead.
Rudimentary tail ending in a tuft of coarse hair.

A Superstitious Folk
In Lankshorn, ancient Gwyrae beliefs blend with the strictures of the Pluritine Church, forming an idiosyncratic
mass of folk belief and superstition. Some example superstitions that adventurers may come across are listed below,
but many more exist. PCs who transgress these edicts
encounter an incredulous or frosty reception from locals.

LANKSHORN SUPERSTITIONS
d6

Superstition

1

It is disrespectful to travel south along the Swallop
Road without carrying a little fresh milk. (This relates
to the shrine to King Pusskin in hex 0711.)
Draining one’s glass completely brings ill luck. A sip
should always be left for the house bogle.
Stepping over a threshold without knocking on the
door first (even if the door is open!) brings ill fortune.
Bringing a sword into a dwelling without first dousing the blade with water invites misfortune upon the
household.
It is advisable to tiptoe up stairs, so as not to disturb the
cob-knockers who make their homes under the boards.
Wiping one’s plate clean with a fresh handkerchief
brings good luck.

The Cruelty of Lord Malbleat
Lankshorners take great pride in the ancient breggle
noble houses which have ruled over their town since time
immemorial. However, the current ruler, Lord Malbleat,
is unloved. Townsfolk fear his frequent visits, demanding
that folk cater to his every whim. He metes out swift and
cruel justice on any who resist, falter, or so much as cast
their glance unwanted in his direction.

Unrest Brewing
Malbleat’s increasingly brazen cruelty is leading to unrest
in Lankshorn. Some folk speak of petitioning the Baron
Hogwarsh to intervene and replace Malbleat or restore
Lankshorn to the domain of Lord Ramius. Others note
that it was Hogwarsh who was responsible for Malbleat’s
appointment as lord of Lankshorn in the first place.

battling.
Entrance: An archway lined with white marble carvings
of a friar (St Pastery) laying hands beneficently on hordes
of cattle.
Interior: In contrast with the church’s grand exterior, the
interior is simple and rustic: lacquered wooden pews, a
stone block altar, and a 5′-high wooden statue of St Pastery
(patron saint of butchers and well-borers) holding a meat
cleaver and a shovel.
Populace: Solemn mourners and supplicants, cheery
choirs. The local vicar, Father Eggwin Dobey, surreptitiously surveying visitors from a balcony. On Sunning
mornings, most of the townsfolk attend the sermon.
Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of
St Pastery: the ability to cast Cure Affliction. See Shrines,
p22.

of cheeses. Horses and hounds of all kinds may also be
purchased on Moot.
Sunning: General market with a mixture of stalls.

Father Eggwin Dobey—Vicar of Lankshorn
The vicar of Lankshorn is a scrawny, stooped human
man of advanced years with a wispy pate and flimsy
spectacles. Dobey is a corrupt priest who cares little
for the Church. He serves Lord Malbleat (p64) and
is complicit in several of his wicked schemes.

despite the doddery impression he presents. Has a habit
of wagging his finger admonishingly.
Speech: Feeble, wavering. Woldish, Liturgic, Old Woldish.

maidservant, Mabble.

4. Graveyard

To the rear of the vicarage lies the village’s graveyard,
bounded by imposing, ivy-clad walls.

writing is a traditional plea to Saint Signis the Silent that
the interred dead may slumber in rest eternal. To anyone
familiar with religious practices within Dolmenwood, it
is clear that the graveyard is under the protection of the
order of Lichwards.
Gravestones: Outsiders may note the presence of goats’
heads carved atop many of the gravestones.

fairy of local legend, said to live in the hearts of great oak
trees and mock the foolish toiling of humans.)

crammed against the walls and a cluster of three small
tables in the centre. Guests are served by the landlady,
Margerie Stallowmade, her three sons, and her twelveyear-old daughter Willow (who has a goat’s hoof in place
of her left hand).
In the late evenings: The tables are often pushed together
in the centre of the common room and used as an improvised stage for raucous dances or musical performances.
Guests: Local folk, pedlars, travellers, and merchants.
There is a 2-in-6 chance per evening of a beloved Lankshorn
resident—the sage Farnham Ribblemead (who rents the

husband and two eldest sons in a pointless war a decade
ago, Margerie has taken to wandering in Dolmenwood,
fascinated by its strange secrets.
Demeanour (Lawful): Presents herself to strangers as
a harmless bumpkin, but has a keen ear and a sharp
memory. Constantly polishes surfaces, mugs, and
guests while chatting.
Speech: Incessant, rustic banter. Woldish.
Desires: To meet a real witch or wizard. To visit Fairy.
To taste the legendary Golden Aspintheon.
Knowledge: She is acquainted with the fairy Thrattlewhit (hex 0810), with whom she shares foraged
blackberries and silly stories of comings and goings in
Lankshorn. She knows the location of the fairy’s lair,
but does not share it lightly.

Farnham Ribblemead—Sage
An elderly human gentleman of gangly frame, with long
white hair, hawkish nose, wide mouth, and stretched,
angular cheeks. Wears shabby leather traveller’s garb
and a pair of half-moon spectacles balanced on his nose.
Demeanour (Lawful): Jocular, high-brow, bumbling.

6. Harper’s Hall

A tall, lime-white manor beside a shallow lake ringed with
storm-wracked elms.
Function: Harper’s Hall serves a dual purpose. First and
foremost, it is the town residence of Lord Malbleat, though
he seldom inhabits it for longer than a night each month.
Secondly, one of its side-wings houses the Berkmaster and
his family.
Inhabitants: The current Berkmaster (installed by
Malbleat when he assumed lordship of the town) is Clewyd
Baldricke (“His Lordship”), who lives here with his wife
Almerie and four adolescent children.
Hidden fugitive: The Berkmaster harbours his grandson—a rebellious young half-human, half-breggle boy
named Billy—who stumbled out of the Wood some months
ago. The boy fled from Redwraith Manor after his governess fed him a dangerous mandrake brew as punishment.
The brew afflicted the boy with a curse, causing him to
mutate into different forms and personalities. Wary of
revealing the boy’s presence, the Berkmaster has enlisted
the aid of the hermit-magician Merridwyn Scymes (hex
808) to discover a means of curing his grandson.

Berkmaster Clewyd Baldricke
A tall, plump human man of around 50 years, with
densely curled, auburn hair on his head, face, and chest.
He dresses in voluptuous purple velvet and wears the
silver boar’s head medallion hereditary to his station.
Many townsfolk privately mock the Berkmaster as a
self-important puppet of Lord Malbleat.
Demeanour (Neutral): Brusque, pompous, incredulous
at any who would question his word.
Speech: Exaggerated booming. Woldish.
Desires: The respect of all in Lankshorn. To cure his
grandson Billy of his curse. To temper the wickedness of
Lord Malbleat. (Privately worries that his lord’s growing
cruelty will lead to rebellion.)
Family: Eldest daughter, Bronywyn, was married
to Lord Malbleat a decade ago and seldom leaves
Redwraith Manor.
Servants: The local constabulary. Several informants
and rumour-mongers in the town report to the Berkmaster of anything untoward.

7. The Bladesmith

A slate-roofed, pebble-walled forge with tall chimney of
stacked slate. The resident blacksmith, Joremey Whilpston-Puddingfoot, earns his daily living shoeing horses,
mending pots, and forging farm tools. His true passion,
however, is for the forging of artisan blades. His handiwork
is of a quality seldom found even in great towns.

Services at the Bladesmith’s
Standard blades: Finely crafted steel blades at 25% above
the normal price.
Iron blades: A small number of iron daggers are kept in
stock at all times, at a cost of 5gp.
Silvering: Silvered daggers and swords may be purchased
at ten times the cost of a plain steel blade. Only silvered
daggers are usually kept in stock.
Engraving: Commissioned blades may be engraved with
patterns, script, or runes, as the buyer wishes. This typically doubles the basic cost. The bladesmith’s work is
detailed and beautiful.
Moon-forging: The bladesmith is privy to a craft of fairy
origin—practiced by very few in the modern day—by
which a blade forged by the light of the full moon can be
imbued with a minor enchantment (see Moon-Forging
Enchantments). Moon-forging takes much preparation and
is only performed to special order for trusted customers.

Joremey Whilpston-Puddingfoot—Bladesmith
A slim human man in his late forties, with black,
slicked-back hair and eyes set wide apart. Unbeknown
to any in the town, Joremey has fairy blood—his grandfather was sired by a wandering elf.
Demeanour (Lawful): Quiet and confident. Down to
earth, but easily waxes lyrical when speaking of his
craft. Holds penetrating eye contact.
Speech: Gentle, lilting quality. Woldish, basic Sylvan.
Desires: To know the identity of his fairy ancestor. To
forge a sword for the Duke of Brackenwold.

8. The Man of Gold
Apothecary

A squat, stone building with a wooden, two-storey tower
lies in a narrow alleyway at the rear of the Hornstoat’s Rest,
cramped between a fishmonger’s and a butchery.
Sign: The sign of a smiling, golden sun swings above the
door, announcing the name and function of this shop.
Proprietor: The Man of Gold is owned and run by Sydewich
Maldwort. The establishment has been in the Maldwort
family for three generations and has an excellent reputation for the quality of its herbs (carefully air-dried in the
tower above the shop).

Services at the Man of Gold
Mushrooms and herbs: The preparations listed in the
Dolmenwood Player’s Book are sold at the standard prices
and with the standard chance of availability.
Alchemical compounds: There is a 2-in-6 chance of each of
the following compounds being in stock: Alchemical Tonic
(p414), Amber Nectar (p414), Memory Dust (p426), Orgon’s
Scintillating Philtre (p414).
Psychedelic compounds: There is a 2-in-6 chance of each
of the following compounds being in stock: Black Clover
(p430), Devil’s Grease (p428), Frisk (p426), Lethe (p426).

Moon-Forging Enchantments
Minor enchantments of any kind may be imbued into
a blade by the craft of moon-forging. The following
enchantments are known to the bladesmith of Lankshorn, but others are possible. Note that the cost is in
addition to the basic cost of the blade.
Foe-binding: Grants a +2 bonus to damage against a
specific foe. This requires a sample of the blood or hair
of the target, which is folded into the surface of the
blade. 500gp.
Vengeance: Grants a +1 bonus to Attack Rolls against
opponents who have wounded the wielder in this
combat. 250gp.

Sydewich Maldwort—Man of Gold Proprietor
A human bachelor in his late thirties, with a fashionable
moustache and long blond hair tied in plaits.

Back-biter: Grants a +1 bonus to Attack Rolls against a
foe retreating from melee. 100gp.

Demeanour (Neutral): Sycophantic, aloof. Bored with
simple townsfolk, but excited to converse with folk of
adventurous spirit.

Moonlight: Speaking the weapon’s name (bestowed
upon it during forging) causes it to emit moonlight in
a 30′ radius for one hour. It must then be recharged by
bathing it in moonlight for a night. 400gp.

Desires: To sell the apothecary and elope with Elmine
Crump, wife of the keeper of the Spawning Salmon
tavern in Dreg (p144), whom he is in love with.

160

Speech: Nasal, oily. Woldish.

Part Five | Set tlements

9. The Nuncle-Stones

A ring of ancient, moss-covered stones standing upon a
hill, looming over the town.
Shunned: The townsfolk shun the stones, believing them
to be associated with the dark magic of the Drune. The
stones are therefore a favoured haunt of local youths,
daring to defy their elders’ wisdom.

13. Bogway’s (Tavern
and Stables)

A ramshackle two-storey drinking establishment with
wonky windows. A large stable yard and stalls are located
at the rear.
Sign: A grinning toad holding a frothing mug of ale.

Swirling vortex: Anyone who can detect magic or the invisible (e.g. those under the influence of Green Aspintheon,
p426) perceives a swirling pink and orange vortex in the
sky above the stones. Anyone who flies into the vortex is
swept away by a violent gust of wind and released half an
hour later above the Isle of Yeth (hex 0505).

Common room: A lofty space, packed with wobbly tables
and stumpy stools. Balconies on the upper floor overlook
the common room. An iron candelabra bearing dozens of
fat candles hangs from chains in the rafters, occasionally
dripping gouts of wax onto patrons below. The proprietors,
Lump “Sarge” Groghorn and Whimsly Bobblefrock, serve
the crowds from behind a row of barrels.

10. The Ditchway

Upper rooms: A bustling and inconveniently low-roofed
dancehall and a series of gloomy side-rooms for card
games or discreet liaisons.

The east-west road, known to locals as the Ditchway,
winds through a broad channel with sandy banks on
either side. The western route is disused, as it passes by
the haunted Lankston Pool (hex 0610), but the eastern road
is frequented by much trade, leading to the port-town Dreg
on the banks of the Hameth (hex 1110).
To the Trothstone: An old path leads into the forest from
the western road out of Lankshorn. Those who follow the
path come to a glade (hex 0609) where, according to tradition, weddings of longhorn nobles take place.

11. Manor Road

The old north road leads to the gates of Lord Malbleat’s
estate at Redwraith Manor (hex 0709). Beyond the
Malbleat’s manor, a track known as Fisher’s Path leads
to the depths of Dwelmfurgh and Lake Longmere in the
heart of the Wood.

12. Swallop Road

A hedge-lined country road winds through rustic farmland
towards High-Hankle.

Guests: A raucous mix of human and shorthorn farm
hands, wayfarers, drunkards, and gamblers.

Services at Bogway’s
Food: Of poor quality (DPB). No lodgings are available
(apart from stabling for mounts).
Nippers: The grimalkin’s favoured tipple, Nippers (DPB), is
always available here.
Stabling: 3sp a night, including fodder. Despite the low
cost, the stables at Bogway’s are of good quality and the
grooms are well-trained and professional.
Horses: Good quality riding horses can often (3-in-6
chance) be purchased from the stables at the normal price.

Lump “Sarge” Groghorn—Bogway’s Proprietor
(Level 3 Fighter)
An ageing, battle-scarred, white-eyed shorthorn man
dressed in grimy leather with a single gold earring.
Served in Lord Murkin’s army for many years.
Demeanour (Neutral): Scowling, mean, laughs readily
and heartily. Pulls one ear when thinking.
Speech: Curt and crude. Woldish, Gaffe.
Desires: To marry a “real lady” (i.e. a longhorn). To steal
Lord Murkin’s enchanted sword (see p65).

Whimsly Bobblefrock—Bogway’s Proprietor
A gangly tortoiseshell grimalkin woman who habitually wears a tricorn hat and an eyepatch. Escaped
imprisonment for gambling debts in Chateau Shantywood (hex 1110) with the aid of a sympathetic bard.
Demeanour (Neutral): Flamboyant, indignant.
Speech: Purring punctuated with yowls. Woldish,
Mewl, Gaffe.
Desires: To relieve the arrogant rich of their baubles. To
burn down Chateau Shantywood (hex 1110).
Possessions: An Eye of the Yurl (p420), hidden beneath
her eyepatch.

Meagre’s Reach
1703—Antiquated
1703
—Antiquated village dredged out of time by Ygraine’s sorcery.

A

quaint village of antique brick structures built
tall and too close to one another. Meagre’s Reach
(or, as locals call it, simply “the Reach”) is located
close to several rich claybeds and thrives on clay mining
and brickmaking.
Inhabitants (120—village): A noticeably aged population
of folk native to the village, alongside a number of outsiders hired to work in the clay pits and brickworks.
Ruler: House Guillefer, in whose domain Meagre’s Reach
falls (see Human Nobility, p56), pays little attention to the
village. Practically, the Reach is run by a council of Elders,
dominated by Reynold Barhaim and Benedict Redhearth
(p164), under the patronage of Ygraine Mordlin (p84), lady
of the nearby Chateau Mauvesse (hex 1802).
Religion: Native Reach-folk are devout adherents of the
Pluritine Church, but have a preference for private contemplation, scriptural study, and prayer in their own homes.
The village’s church is little used.

Reynold Barhaim—Brickmaster
A hearty, middle-aged human man of 115 years (as an
Elder, he was born 315 years ago) with a bald pate and
luxuriantly curled black beard and eyebrows. As owner
of the brickworks, Barhaim is the richest person in
Meagre’s Reach.
Demeanour (Neutral): Bold, mirthful, arrogant.
Speech: Cordial rumbling. Woldish.
Desires: To see the world beyond the Reach. To quash
Redhearth’s rebellion (see Redhearth’s Rebels, p164).
Possessions: A silver raven Talisman of Dimensional
Anchoring (p398)—a secret gift from Ygraine. The
talisman allows a resident of Meagre’s Reach to survive
outside of hex 1703 for up to 48 hours. Barhaim and
his five sons secretly use the talisman to visit Chateau
Mauvesse and the Dark Mirror.

Rumours: See Rumours in Meagre’s Reach, p449.

Rebels and Loyalists

Plague Village Snatched Out of Time

Unrest is brewing in Meagre’s Reach, as the two most influential Elders vie for control. The village baker, Benedict
Redhearth (p164), believes that Ygraine keeps the village
enchanted as a plaything and wishes to break free of her
(supposed) sorcerous yoke. The owner of the village’s brickworks, Reynold Barhaim, remains loyal to Ygraine, opposing Redhearth and his rebels. In secret, Barhaim is training
his workers as a militia to resist Redhearth’s rebels, should
it come to violence.

Meagre’s Reach has a curious history: 250 years ago, it
was ravaged by plague and became a ghost town, entirely
abandoned. 100 years later, Ygraine took up residence in
the nearby Chateau Mauvesse (hex 1802). Taking pity on
the fate of Meagre’s Reach, she worked great magic to give
its people a second chance. The village as it existed 300
years ago—before the plague—was wrested out of time
and brought into the present day.
While this history is not immediately apparent to travellers, locals are willing to discuss it if asked.

Elders and Younglings
The resurrected villagers (who were born over 300
years ago) are known as the Elders. Due to a side-effect
of Ygraine’s temporal magic, they age at one-third of the
normal rate—some have lived through more than 150
winters. Those born in Meagre’s Reach since it was resurrected—known as Younglings—age normally.

The Curse of Meagre’s Reach
Ygraine’s magic was flawed, however, causing unexpected
temporal anomalies.
Local folk are trapped: The most significant side-effect of
Ygraine’s magic is that any person born in Meagre’s Reach
cannot leave hex 1703. Those who pass outside the hex
disappear into oblivion.
Dreams outside of time: Some Elders experience vivid
dreams of their lives in the alternate timeline in which
they died in the plague. Benedict Redhearth (p164) even
claims to recall dying and ascending to Heaven.

1. Village Square

Redhearth’s Rebels—Dissident Gang

A tidy, brick-paved square whose breadth feels diminished
by the overhanging eaves of the teetering buildings that
surround it.

Purpose: To free Meagre’s Reach from Ygraine’s spell,
believing that she keeps the village enchanted as a plaything, purposefully entrapping its people.

The Frozen: Amid the bustle of the square, three villagers
stand stock-still: an old woman carrying a basket of loaves,
a dapper man with a feather in his cap, and a young girl
crouched as if playing with a cat. These individuals are, in
fact, frozen in time—victims of a flaw in Ygraine’s magic.
They are impervious to weathering and damage. The Elders
(some of whom knew the frozen people when alive) keep
them free of moss and bird droppings.

Membership: A growing contingent of Reach-folk,
currently numbering 26—mostly consisting of youths
who seek to defy authority and those who have known
relatives that wandered too far from the village and
never returned. The gang has established a camp in
the woods to the west of the village, where a number
of them now live full time (see hex 1703).

Eggfast market and sermons: Every Eggfast, a general
market takes place in the square. Typically, Benedict
Redhearth takes the opportunity to climb upon the village
well and give fire and brimstone sermons to a crowd of
cheering followers (see Redhearth’s Rebels). Redhearth
beseeches all who “would know Heaven’s Light” to gather
weapons and await the time to strike at Ygraine, freeing
the Reach of the sorceress’s arcane bondage.

2. The Chapel of the Host
of Heaven’s Light

A narrow church whose sober grey stone contrasts against
the colourful brickwork of the rest of the village. Gargoyles
in the form of puff-cheeked, goggle-eyed devils and priests
festoon its exterior, also at ground level.
Entrance: An inconspicuous oaken door, merely 5′ high.
Interior: A poky space crammed with pews, candle holders, incense burners, stacks of prayer books, and far too
many pillars. A beautiful wooden idol of St Lillibeth of
the Sugared Breath stands upon the altar, depicted with a
dozen doves perched among her cascading, gilded locks.
Populace: A small number of Younglings and the occasional traveller. 2-in-6 chance of the sage Lorrima Gravesby
(p165) in prayer. Sister Delora observes stoically.
Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of
St Lillibeth: the ability to cast Lesser Healing. See Shrines,
p22.

Sister Nancy Delora—Nun
A stony-faced old human nun, dressed in a chaste white
robe embroidered with golden doves. Sister Delora is an
Elder who served as assistant to Vicar Hallyman, 300
years ago. She takes confession and holds services in
the chapel, still awaiting the return of the vicar, who
she claims is “away on pilgrimage.” (In truth, Hallyman
left Meagre’s Reach and disappeared into oblivion—a
victim of the village’s temporal curse.)
Demeanour (Neutral): Meditative stillness, verging on
torpidity. Standoffish. Isolated from reality.
Speech: Frosty, creaky. Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: To be excluded from contentious goings-on in
the village. Secretly wishes to leave Meagre’s Reach and
go on pilgrimage to Castle Brackenwold, but knows this
is an impossibility.

164

Current scheme: Gather weapons and strike at Ygraine
and her (supposed) coterie of witches and sorcerers.

Benedict Redhearth—Baker / Dissident Leader
A hale old human man of 140 years (as an Elder, he was
born 340 years ago) with spiky red hair and beard, a
distended gut, and fire in his eyes. Redhearth is visited
nightly by dreams of his past life and claims to recall
his death and the embrace of Heaven (though he will
not speak of the details).
Demeanour (Neutral): Cantankerous, obsessive.
Speech: Hoarse tirades and quiet mumbling. Woldish.
Desires: To free the people of Meagre’s Reach from their
bondage under Ygraine’s magic. Secretly believes that
ending Ygraine’s spell on the village will bring about
the death of its inhabitants. He desires above all to
return himself and the other Elders to Heaven.

3. Redhearth Bakery

The village bakery is notable for the vividly painted, lifesize statue of St Hollyhock (patron saint of bakers’ ovens)
integrated into its exterior at ground level. The saint is
depicted with soot-covered face and hands, clutching a
basket overflowing with scones. Two doors flank the statue:
the entrance on his left and the exit on his right.
Limited opening hours: The bakery opens early and closes
mid-morning.
Interior: A cramped room stuffed with baskets. The heat
and clouds of flour dust are nigh unbearable. The baker,
Benedict Redhearth (p164), furiously shovels fresh buns
out of the oven and into baskets.

Services at Redhearth Bakery
Baked goods: If caught in a pleasant mood, Redhearth sells
exquisite cookies and spiced bread for 2sp a ration.

4. Everslumber Lane

A narrow lane lined with family crypts, the arch around
each door decorated with human skulls. Within each crypt
are interred the bones of many generations of Reach-folk,
who do not bury their dead in the ground like other folk
of Dolmenwood.
Dates: The names and dates of death of the interred are
carved on the doors. Close study reveals a gap in the dates:
no deaths occurred between 250 years ago and 100 years
ago. (Locals refer to this period as “the missing years.”)

Primulus Paste—Grizzle and Grouse Proprietor

Lorrima Gravesby—Sage (Level 4 Cleric)

A rotund, sour-faced, slack-jowled human man in his
middle years (a Youngling), with a dirty mop of blond
hair and drooping moustaches like a pair of rat tails.
Dresses in grubby hose and shirts, splitting at the seams.

An elderly human woman of graceful bearing, with
long silver hair and deep grey eyes. Dresses in plain
white robes, with an ornate, swan-crested silver helm
(a Helm of Realignment (p406)—she was formerly
Lawful). Born in Castle Brackenwold, Gravesby retired
to Meagre’s Reach to pursue her passion for the study
of monster lore. Unbeknown to any in Meagre’s Reach,
Gravesby is a former cleric of the Order of St Signis and
retains the capabilities of that Class.

Demeanour (Neutral): Miserly, easily startled.
Speech: Acerbic grumbling. Woldish.
Desires: To marry his eldest daughter, Pilphra (24), to
any well-off outsider willing to settle in the Reach.

5. The Grizzle and
Grouse (Inn)

Demeanour (Neutral): Wry, humble, vilifies arrogance.
Speech: Slow and soft. Prone to in-depth tangents.
Woldish, Old Woldish, Liturgic.

A tall, narrow building on the edge of the village,
constructed of purple-glazed bricks with an iridescent
sheen. A grinning man in the moon face is engraved in
each brick.

Desires: Erudite companionship. Books from afar.
Monster specimens—whole carcasses or parts.

Sign: The man in the moon weeping into a bowl of porridge,
clutching a glass of claret.

Possessions: A platinum Ring of Energy Resistance (Fire,
p410), engraved with a wyrm biting its own tail.

Common room: Smoky, dimly lit, and low-beamed, with
tables crammed into odd nooks and corners. A magnificent
pair of stuffed grouse is poised dramatically above the bar,
the landlord, Primulus Paste, serving dourly beneath. Of
an evening, the landlord’s wife, Betsy, plays the fiddle and
forces guests to dance duets with ill-matched partners.
Guests: A rowdy assortment of local Reach-folk and immigrant brick-workers. A group of Redhearth’s Rebels (p164)
invariably occupies a shadowed corner table, conspiring
quietly. They may approach able-looking outsiders, seeking to enlist them to their cause.

Services at the Grizzle and Grouse
Food: Of common quality (DPB).
Stoggy stew: Fermented game fowl served on a plate of
beans—a local speciality. 3sp a plate.

6. Smarg’s Turret

A square, four-storey turret, complete with crenellations,
standing utterly incongruously at the edge of the village,
under the boughs of a mighty copper beech. The origin of
the turret and the identity of Smarg are unclear, even to
Elders, but it is commonly believed to be the remnant of a
much larger fortification.

Knowledge: Specialises in the monsters of Dolmenwood. Apply the standard rules for hiring a sage (DPB).

7. Barhaim and Sons
Brickyard

A broad, dusty fenced yard, with towering piles of stacked
bricks and a bustle of carts, draft horses, and whistling
brick-workers.
Kilns: A trio of kilns at the north of the yard operates day
and night, firing clay from pits just south of the village and
from the enchanted banks of the Dark Mirror (hex 1802).
Workers: A mix of locals and migrant workers from other
parts of Dolmenwood. The Reach-folk for the most part
work the kilns and the outsiders the clay pits. The outsiders are essential for operations, as the locals cannot leave
this hex to make the four-mile journey to the Dark Mirror.
The owners, Reynold Barhaim (p162) and his five sons
hawkishly observe proceedings from a raised platform.
Lodgings: To the west of the brickyard stands a long,
three-storey building whose ground floor serves as a
warehouse. The upper floors contain rows of bunks for
the scores of migrant workers.
At night: Muffled sounds of military drills (blades clashing, drill instructor yelling) emanate from the basement
of the workers’ lodgings.

Entrance: A reinforced wooden door adorned with a
Chapes holy symbol, in brass.

8. Follyegg Road

Interior: Pristine, whitewashed walls, simple yet beautiful wooden furnishings, and meticulously ordered bookshelves (folklore and bestiaries) lining the spiral stairways.
A silver Holy Shield (p400) bearing the symbol of St Signis
hangs in the library on the second floor.

9. Mirror Road

Cellars: Expansive cellars contain jarred and stuffed specimens of fairies, monsters, and fantastic beasts.
Inhabitants: The sage Lorrima Gravesby and 3 lichhounds
(DPB), named Benester, Eggort, and Hollyhock.

A twisting, little-used road in the deep forest, leading west
to the village of Odd (hex 1403).

Paved with violet-glazed bricks, shimmering as though
always cast in the light of an unobscured sunset, falling
only into darkness when the moon is high. The Mirror Road
leads four miles directly to the gates of Chateau Mauvesse
(hex 1802), home of Ygraine the Sorceress (p84).

Visitors: Those who wish to consult with the sage and
those with reports of monsters are welcomed to the library.
Others are genially rejected.

A

huddle of thatched wooden huts intermingled

glade around a grassy knoll, on which stands a
ramshackle church.
Inhabitants (90—village): Rustic, woodland folk, distinguished by their height and black hair (they have mixed
Drune heritage).
Ruler: Odd is within the domain of House Guillefer (see

Religion: Odd-folk ostensibly follow the Pluritine Church,
but the village church is clearly disused. If questioned
about this, the villagers claim that they worship in their
homes, only using the church for marriages and baptisms.
In fact, they worship “beast saints” (amalgams of one of
the saints of Dolmenwood with an animalistic folk-deity)
at secret shrines in their attics.
Rumours: See Rumours in Odd, p450.

Fur and Game Hunters
Situated in the deep woods, the people of Odd are predominantly trappers and hunters. Traders regularly travel from
Prigwort to purchase fur from the Odd-folk, and quality
inns as far south as Castle Brackenwold covet the rare
game that can be trapped in the woods around the village.
Indeed, the bolder folk of the village venture into the hunting grounds of the fairy Duke Mai-Fleur (p30—hexes
1402, 1502, 1503, 1602) to poach the fairy animals which
live there.

Drifting into Fairy
Over the last few centuries, Odd has come under the effect
of a dimensional anomaly of unknown provenance—it is
slowly drifting into the fairy realm of Diuthurnia (p30).
The Drune exert the power of the monolith in the church
(see The Orbstone, p168) to tether the village to the
mortal world.

The Village’s Name Keeps Changing
The most noticeable effect of the village’s dimensional
vagueness is that it has a different name each time outsiders enter. Only outsiders refer to this village by the name
Odd—the villagers themselves refer to the place by other
names, different every time outsiders arrive. When the
name seemingly changes, the villagers themselves do not
ever remember it being called anything else.

1. The Church

A run-down church of weather-stained stone, perched atop
the knoll in the centre of the village. The church is locked
up and appears disused. In place of a spire, a black monolith
protrudes (see The Orbstone).
Wall: The church is girded by a 5′ high wall with a rusty iron
gate that creaks in the wind.
Churchyard: Wild old yew trees. Graves marked with
miniature obelisks, rather than conventional gravestones.
Entrances: All windows are shuttered. Doors are chained
and locked. (The village headman, Broobe Dogoode, and
the local Drune have keys.)
Interior: Wooden pews stacked at one side. Thorny twigs
litter the floor. Altar covered in melted, black wax. No religious oddments—it is unclear to which saint this shrine
was dedicated. At the rear, the Orbstone ascends through
the roof.
On nights of the full moon: Drunes slip into the village
and perform rituals in the church, decanting the spirit
energies of the Orbstone—a phosphorescent green gloop—
into copper urns.

The Orbstone
A 30′ tall monolith of sheer black stone, glassy and almost
mirror-smooth.
Reflections in the stone: Appear distorted and beast-like.
Faintly glowing green markings: Palm-sized, runes of
Drunic script, interwoven with fine Woldish script, etched
into the stone: hundreds of human names, both modern
and archaic.

2. The Moggle’s Gob (Inn)

Inscribed spell: The Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Speak With Dead (p457). An arcane spell-caster can transcribe the runes for future study (treated as studying a
spell book). Copying the spell takes 3 hours. The hundreds
of souls imprisoned in the monolith may be addressed
via this spell.

Sign: The gaping maw of a monster, showing its malformed
teeth and dangling tonsils.

Function: The Orbstone was placed in Odd by the Drune
many centuries ago, pre-dating the church, which was built
around it later. The stone acts as a soul siphon, trapping the
spirits of all who die in the village. (It is their names that
can be read on the surface.) The Drune extract the energies
of the trapped spirits for use in their magic. In recent years,
a portion of the spirit energy is harnessed to tether Odd to
the mortal world, preventing it from drifting into Fairy.
Destroying the stone: Releases the souls of the dead and
causes Odd to drift off into Diuthurnia, disappearing from
the mortal world within a fortnight.

The village’s only tavern, slumped and bulging under the
weight of its oversized thatch.

Common room: Gloomy, smoky, and poky, yet cosy. The
landlady, Mogget Crookbone, serves from behind a bar
strewn with bear wolf pelts.
Guests: The patrons, of an evening, consist of local drunkards and gamblers, prone to aggressive tirades.

Services at the Moggle’s Gob
Lodgings and food: Of poor quality (DPB).
Game stew: Spicy fresh forest game. 4sp a portion.
Stabling: The inn has no stable, but animals can be lodged
in a barn elsewhere in the village for 2sp a night.

Mogget Crookbone—Moggle’s Gob Proprietor
A grim-faced human woman in her forties, with curly,
grizzled hair and a pipe of Old Doby (DPB) perpetually
in her teeth. Her left hand is missing three fingers (she
alleges they were torn off by an owlbear). Reports all she
observes to Broobe Dogoode, the headman.
Demeanour (Neutral): Morbid, cool toward strangers.
Rubs the stumps of her missing fingers.
Speech: Sour and scornful. Cackles maniacally. Woldish, basic Drunic.
Desires: To marry a Drune, for the prestige.

Broobe Dogoode—Village Headman
A hulking, thickset human man in his fifties, with an
unkempt mane of black hair and a purple scar across his
cheek. Broobe is the village headman, appointed by the
Drune, and an adept tracker.
Demeanour (Neutral): Domineering, obstinate.
Absently scratches his stubble.
Speech: Sonorous, sombre. Woldish, basic Drunic.
Desires: To join Duke Mai-Fleur’s (p30) hunt. To
know the origin of the wretched masses of tentacles in
the woods to the south (hex 1404).
Possessions: Keys to the church.

3. The Home of the Sage

An elegant, venerable, two-storeyed home of tarred wood,
and white-daubed walls, with a roof of grey slate. Stands
under the eaves of several great beeches. This is the home
of Philontimus the Wizened.
Entrance: A brass plaque hangs on the front door. It depicts
the face of the Green Man (p36) and carries the slogan
(in Old Woldish) “Seek, know, teach” (an odd variant on an
old Drune rede).
Interior: Jumbled piles of books, leaning bookshelves, cabinets of curiosities.
Inhabitants: The sage Philontimus the Wizened and
his grandson, a lad of 20 named Briggle who acts as his
manservant, page, and research assistant.
Visitors: Those with serious enquiries after the sage’s
wisdom are welcomed to his study. Others are barred.
Treasure: The home is littered with valuable (if obscure)
items. A locked chest is hidden under the floorboards of
the study. It holds 200pp, 1,200gp, 8,000sp, a pockmarked
bronze Ring of Invisibility (p410), and a vial of Vaporous
Spirits (p414).

Philontimus the Wizened—Sage
A hunched, frail, bespectacled human man of 70 years,
with a white beard down to his knees. He wears a curious robe of golden feathers at all times. Originally hailing from outside Dolmenwood, Philontimus has spent
the latter half of his life in Odd, drawn to the obscure
reaches of Dolmenwood where ancient ways still flourish.
Demeanour (Lawful): Wry, ponderous, near-sighted.
Despises the wilfully ignorant. Coughs feebly.
Speech: Feeble and wavering. Prone to excited, highpitched exclamations. Woldish, Old Woldish, Drunic,
Sylvan, Caprice, a profusion of dead tongues.
Desires: Pays handsomely for ancient artefacts, especially those associated with the Gwyrae religion. Loves
fruit pies.
Knowledge: Specialises in the ancient religions,
legends, and folklore of Dolmenwood. Apply the standard rules for hiring a sage (DPB).

4. The Lodge

A precarious, narrow, two-storey hut decorated with
antlers and animal skulls hanging from the eaves. The
lodge functions as a meeting place for the villagers, a fur
trading emporium, and the home of the village headman,
Broobe Dogoode, and his family.
Entrance: A black-lacquered door in a high archway. The
door is usually locked, but a dull tin bell may be rung for
attention.
Ground floor: A wide room with a roof supported by great,
tarred beams. Hundreds of sets of antlers of all sizes hang
from the rafters. A great wooden table stands in the centre
of the room, typically spread with a profusion of furs. Two
dozen chairs are pushed against the walls.
Inhabitants: The village headman, Broobe Dogoode, lives
in the upper floor with his family. Broobe descends to the
meeting hall to greet visitors and sell the village’s excellent
quality fur garments.

Orbswallow
1405—Mossling
1405
—Mossling village in the deep fungal forest of Mulchgrove.

A

community in the seldom-trod fungal forest of
Mulchgrove, clustered around a pair of gargantuan toadstools and three magical trees. Lush
moss covers every surface not occupied by giant, garish
fungus.
Inhabitants (80—village): Mosslings. No humans or folk
of other Kindreds dwell here.
Ruler: House Guillefer, in whose domain Orbswallow lies
(see Human Nobility, p56), pays no attention whatsoever to the village of mosslings. Orbswallow is thus effectively independent, ruled by an individual known as the
Chief Mulcher. The Chief Mulcher is selected every seven
years by an oracular process—currently Brimbul.
Religion: As subjects of the duke, the folk of Orbswallow
are nominally followers of the Pluritine Church. In practice, they worship an entity named Blosquom that manifests in their fungal shrine (p173). Unbeknown to the
folk of Orbswallow, Blosquom is an aspect of the Myconom
(p38). The locals also commonly journey into the fungal
forest to seek the guidance of the mould oracle Gropoll
in her hidden grotto (hex 1405) dedicated to the clay-god
Mbombre.
Rumours: See Rumours in Orbswallow, p451.

Centre of Mossling Culture
While mosslings dwell in small communities throughout
Mulchgrove (e.g. the burrows in hex 1706), the heart of
their culture lies in Orbswallow. Mosslings from isolated
hamlets come to seek council, to trade, and to drink Moon’s
Milk (DPB—only brewed in Orbswallow).

The Three Trees and Their Fruits
Orbswallow is centred around three great and venerable
trees—the Milktree, the Moontree, and the Pipetree—each
with unique magical properties. The folk of Orbswallow
carefully protect and tend to the trees, on whose fruits
their livelihood depends. The loss of one of the trees would
bring calamity to the village. As a precaution against such
disaster, breeding programmes are attempted, although
none has been entirely successful, to date.

The Pipers, the Milkers, and the Waxers
The folk of Orbswallow are divided into three clans—the
Pipers, the Milkers, and the Waxers—each dedicated to
the tending of one of the three trees and harvesting and
processing its produce. Mosslings of each clan are jokingly
said to display a certain temperament: Pipers are said to be
hasty and headstrong, Milkers gullible and guileless, and
Waxers fickle and sly.

170

Brimbul—Chief Mulcher of Orbswallow
A squashed-looking, middle-aged mossling woman,
with tiny black eyes, matted, root-like hair, and a long,
floppy nose that looks like a limp parsnip. As designated
leader of Orbswallow, Brimbul lives among each of the
three clans on a rotating basis.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Suspicious, feigned cordiality.
Quick to judge, narrow-minded.
Speech: Squeaking and grumbling. Woldish, Mulch.
Possessions: A prismatic crystal Talisman of Spell
Reflection (p398, 3 charges). (Unaware of its magic.)
Desires: The expulsion of all nutcaps from the
surrounding woods (her husband was slain by them
while defending the three trees—see Conflict With
Nutcaps). The secret alchemical recipe to combine the
essences of the three trees, producing (according to
Blosquom—p173) an elixir of eternal life. (She has no
idea that the nutcaps in this hex already know how to
create this elixir, though its powers are not quite what
Brimbul imagines.)
Reward: Would reward any who can expel the nutcaps
with 1,000gp (a substantial portion of the village’s
wealth), an antique, zircon-encrusted composting urn
(worth 1,500gp), and her crystal talisman.

Mossling Trade Goods
Though Orbswallow is not situated on a trade route
frequented by merchant caravans, pedlars and wayfarers sometimes come here to trade. The smokepipes and
creamy cheeses of Orbswallow are known and beloved in
the local region (e.g. in Prigwort).

Conflict With Nutcaps
Multiple colonies of nutcaps (DMB) dwell in clusters of
trees in the fungal forest around Orbswallow (see 1405).
In an ongoing and escalating conflict, the nutcaps launch
aerial raids on Orbswallow, snatching the delicious fruits
of the three trees. The nutcaps believe they have a right to
the produce of all trees in Dolmenwood, but the mosslings
disagree. Most of the folk of Orbswallow would be glad to
find a peaceful coexistence with the nutcaps, but Brimbul
and a few vocal supporters brook no compromise.

Equipment Availability

Special produce of the three trees can be bought (see
village area descriptions). Only rustic weapons (e.g. arrows,
daggers, shortbows, slings, staves) are available. No armour
aside from the special forms of mossling armour listed in
the DPB can be purchased in Orbswallow.

1. The Milktree

Broad, bulbous, and oak-like, the Milktree is festooned
with pendulous, orb-shaped fruits bearing a remarkable
resemblance to mammalian teats. The low-hanging fruits
are filled with sweet, nourishing milk or yoghurt, while
those in the upper branches are filled with cheese. These
fruits form a significant part of the village’s food.
Wardens: The mosslings who tend the Milktree live in a
cluster of huts around its base—Milkers’ Huts.

6. Old Thromby

A giant toadstool which houses six mossling families of
the Pipers clan. Half dwell in chambers dug out of the toadstool’s flesh, the rest in houses perched precariously upon
its dome.

Services at Old Thromby
The dry-husked fruits of the Pipetree are fashioned into
several types of pipe, which can be purchased here.

Wicker spheres: Mosslings napping in the cosy wicker
spheres hanging among the branches are a common sight.

Smokepipes: Gourd-like fruits with a stem, mouthpiece,
and bowl, perfectly suited for smoking pipeleaf. 1gp.

2. The Pipetree

Windpipes: Long, reedy fruits riddled with holes which,
upon catching the wind, produce whistling tones soothing
to livestock. 4gp.

Sprawling and multi-limbed, with maple-like leaves, the
Pipetree bears long, hollow, dry-husked fruits. The husks
are harvested and crafted into several kinds of pipes, used
by the villagers and sold for export.
Wardens: The mosslings who tend the Pipetree live in and
upon Old Thromby, a giant toadstool nearby.

3. The Moontree

Tall, elegant, and birch-like, the Moontree bears fruits of
several different kinds, hanging in clusters high among
its delicate, silver limbs. The characteristics of the fruits
resemble the phases of the moon and see use, variously,
as food, pigmentation, tools, oils, and lighting.
Wardens: The mosslings who tend the Moontree make
their homes in rooms carved out of a natural rock formation—Waxers’ Rock—which stands nearby.

4. Sapling Grove

A sheltered grove of experimental saplings—cuttings and
cross-breedings of the three trees. The cuttings invariably
perish after a decade, never bearing fruit.

5. Milkers’ Huts

Squat huts, built of wicker and slimy mud, huddled around
the base of the Milktree. Five mossling families of the Milkers clan live here. The place reeks of mouldy cheese.

Dancepipes: Thick, pot-bellied, woody fruits bored with
holes to serve perfectly as a musical instrument. Especially
beloved by woodgrues. 10gp.

7. Waxers’ Rock

A natural rock formation that houses seven mossling families of the Waxers clan, who dwell in rooms carved out of
the rock. A cacophony of snorting and oinking emanates
from the hog enclosures at the feet of the rock.

Services at Waxers’ Rock
The harvested fruits of the Moontree can be purchased.
New moon fruits: Succulent black orbs, 6″ in diameter,
filled with a sweet, nourishing, midnight-black juice. Each
fruit is treated as a day’s rations. The juice can also be used
as a pigment, sufficient to dye a person-sized object. 1gp.
Crescent fruits: Golden, sickle-shaped shards with the
strength of steel. Used in Orbswallow as cutting, carving,
and digging tools. May also be used as a weapon (treat as
a dagger). 3gp.
Waxing fruits: Near-hemispheres of soft, yellow, fatty
tissue. Valued for the lubricative and preservative properties of their waxy juices. 1gp.
Gibbous fruits: Bulbous spheroids of yellow, green-veined
flesh. Consumed as a delicacy, having a nectar-like flavour.
Each fruit is treated as a day’s rations. 2gp.

Speciality cheeses fermented from the fruits of the Milktree can be purchased from the home-fromageries.

Full moon fruits: The rarest of the Moontree’s fruits.
Perfect, milk-white, spheres 1′ in diameter. Give off a
warm, creamy glow in a 20′ diameter. Once picked, the
glow subsides after 1 week. 5gp.

Old Shuck: Rigid, stinking, and ultra-mature (mild and
creamy to mossling tastes). 10gp per 18″ round.

8. Compost Heap

Services at the Milkers’ Huts

Hogger: Wrinkled and covered in fuzzy green mould.
Consumption by non-mosslings induces the profuse
growth of mossy green chest hair and has a 10% chance
per complete cheese round eaten of increasing Constitution by 1 (at most once). 20gp per 6″ round.
Buggler-boot: Grotesquely slimy (to non-mosslings), hairy
blue strands, sold in sock-like leather pouches. Each full
pouch consumed (takes 1 Turn) has a 3-in-6 chance of healing 1 HP. Non-mosslings can only consume one pouch per
day without vomiting. 20gp per pouch.

172

A steaming mound of decomposing vegetable matter
and mossling dung. The stench is almost unbearable (to
humans, at least—mosslings savour the aroma).
Toilet platform: A small platform hangs over the heap from
the top of Waxers’ Rock. Happily defecating mosslings
perch shamelessly upon stools on the platform, adding
their dung to the mound.
Examining the heap: Several decomposing mossling
corpses can be found. The mosslings bring their dead here,
piling them up to decompose into mould.

Part Five | Set tlements

Phrobe—Sombre Lamb Proprietor

Blosquom—Fungal Avatar

A rotund mossling man, hunched over with age, with
bulbous black eyes, a broad toothless grin, and straggling, white mycelial hair. Dresses in mould-riddled
woollens and a floppy hog-skin cap.

A jolly, long-nosed face ringed with tiny, waving hands,
manifested in a cloud of greenish mushroom spores.
Blosquom is worshipped by the mosslings of Orbswallow, who are not aware that it is a manifestation of the
Myconom (p38).

Demeanour (Neutral): Gentle, nurturing. Nearly blind
(mistakes strangers for people he knows).
Speech: Constant burbling and cackling. Makes jokes no
one else understands. Woldish, Mulch.
Desires: To meet the fabled “Duke of Brackenwoolled”
(who he believes is a unicorn of some kind).

9. The Sombre Lamb (Inn)

A giant toadstool housing the village’s tavern and brewery,
the Sombre Lamb.
Sign: A wooden sign bearing the words “The Sombre
Lamb—Folk of All Clans Welcome.”
Common room: Porous, smoke-stained walls of spongy
mushroom flesh. Crowded with quirky wooden stools,
tables, and log benches. Illuminated by the pale, creamy
glow of full moon fruits (see Services at Waxers’ Rock)
perched upon rickety shelves among the skulls of forest
animals and pieces of artistic wood. The landlord Phrobe
serves from a little moss-clad nook.

Demeanour (Neutral): Flippant, merry. Operates on a
cosmic plane, with no conception of worldly matters.
Speech: Lazy sighing. Woldish, Mulch, Sylvan.
Desires: Corpses for spore infestation, to further spread
the influence of the Myconom throughout Dolmenwood. Interested parties may be instructed to slay
a particular individual in Dolmenwood, bring their
corpse to the fungal shrine for spore infestation, then
bury the corpse in a specific locale in Mulchgrove.
Reward: The friendship of all fungus-kind, manifesting as a +1 bonus to Reaction Rolls when encountering
fungal monsters and the one-time ability to cast Dominate on a fungal monster.

11. Fungal Shrine

In the dank forest just outside the village stands a tall,
white mushroom, swaying gently as if in a breeze. Little
niches are carved into its stem.

Guests: At night-time the mushroom is jam-packed with
local mosslings, merrily drinking and smoking. Travellers
are rare and are treated politely until all are inebriated.

Offerings: Many of the niches are occupied by offerings
left here by the locals: gourds carved with silly faces, little
rounds of creamy cheese, strips of hog blubber. All are
riddled with furry, white mould.

Services at the Sombre Lamb

“Eat me!”: Visitors hear a chorus of squeaky voices, imploring them to consume one of the mouldy offerings. Anyone
who does Save Versus Doom or enter into a psychedelic
trance of vomiting and vision questing for 1d8 hours,
suffering 1 HP damage per hour (mosslings only suffer
damage every other hour). Survivors gain a cryptic clue
to a puzzle which vexes them, granted by the Myconom.

Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB).
Black new moon soup: Spiced with pine sap. Stains the
tongue and teeth for days. 2sp.
Beverages: Only Moon’s Milk (DPB) and Glubwob (DPB) are
served, both brewed in mycelial cellars beneath the inn.

10. The Weaning Arch

A stone arch of apparently natural origin, completely overgrown with brambles, ivy, and wild roses.
Rituals: The mosslings conduct various rites of passage
beneath the arch, where they bathe initiates in hog-cream.
Clearing the brambles: Reveals a series of graven bands of
magical script. If deciphered (e.g. using Decipher), the script
describes a ritual to summon spirits of flame. An arcane
spell-caster may perform the hour-long ritual at the arch,
requiring the burning of rare woods (worth 250gp). The
ritual opens a dimensional rift beneath the arch, releasing a cascade of wicked fire spirits (treat as a single fire
elemental—see the arcane spell Conjure Elemental). The
summoner must Save Versus Spell—if successful, the
spirits obey their commands for 1 hour per Level, before
vanishing back to their own dimension. If the save fails,
the spirits cannot be controlled and wreak gleeful destruction.

Characters with Wisdom 13+: Trigger a mist of spores to

Prigwort
1106—Famed
1106
—Famed brewing and market town in the heart of the Wood.

S

ituated in a hilly clearing in the deep woods,
Prigwort is a market town famed for its breweries, inns, and taverns. Within the confines of the
town wall, twisting alleys and crooked stairways weave
between quaint wooden cottages and high-gabled inns,
all decorated with colourful, pseudo-heraldic imagery and
elaborate wood carving.
Inhabitants (2,800—small town): A large majority of folk
of Prigwort origin, together with a smattering of travellers
and traders who wandered this way and decided to remain.
Ruler: The Elevated Council of Brewmasters sees to the
day-to-day running of Prigwort, as representatives of Lady
Harrowmoor (p60). The council also (in secret) pays fealty
to the fairy Earl of Yellow (p32), under whose protection
Prigwort lies.
Religion: It is said (by outsiders) that Prigwort folk glorify
ale above all. In reality, it would be fair to say that the
church and the tavern share equal space in their hearts.
Rumours: See Rumours in Prigwort, p452.

The Elevated Council of Brewmasters
Prigwort’s council consists of one elected representative
from each of the Seven Noble Brewing Houses. The brewmasters may be seen, upon occasion, in public houses,
where they can be recognised by their regalia: a pewter
torc in the form of a two-headed eagle.

Beers and Fine Spirits
Located in the middle of Dolmenwood, the brewers of Prigwort have at their disposal a vast assortment of wild herbs,
roots, and berries with which to flavour their concoctions.
The admixture of such substances yields beers and spirits
with delightfully intoxicating and even magical qualities.

Secret Congress with the Earl of Yellow
While the common folk of Prigwort speak often of the fairy
Earl of Yellow (p32), they believe him to be merely a figure
from folktale. The brewmasters, however, are privy to a
carefully guarded secret: the council pays tribute to the
Earl in the form of Prigwort’s finest spirituous beverages.
In return, the Earl protects the town in time of need and
supplies the brewmasters with fabulous ingredients from
Fairy for inclusion in their brews.

The Seven Noble Brewing Houses
Brewing and distillation dominate Prigwort culture to
such a degree that all townsfolk are proud members of
one of seven noble brewing houses. Each house has its
own insignia and traditional festival garb, as well as a
seat on the town council (see The Elevated Council of
Brewmasters). The seven houses are as follows:
1. House Cobsworth: Specialises in light, fizzy beers.
Insignia: a bear with a beer keg on its head. Leader:
the Elevated Wilfrinda Grump.
2. House Halthwidden: Specialises in heavy stouts.
Insignia: five fists clutching bunches of hops. Leader:
the Elevated Daphnemene Hedger.
3. House Oberon: Prigwort’s finest distillery, whose
libations are legendary throughout Dolmenwood.
Insignia: a mandrake root stirring a cauldron with
a rod. Leader: the Elevated Sirrop Drouge.
4. House Ogsbody: Specialises in heavy, hoppy ales.
Insignia: a ram with ivy intertwined in its horns.
Leader: the Elevated Persimone Ogsbody.
5. House Pilston: Producers of low grade beer for the
mass market. Said by some to be sullying the noble
art of brewing. Insignia: a skewered apple. Leader:
the Elevated Smyde Humblebuff.
6. House Sumferish: Specialises in aspintheon of all
kinds. Insignia: a crow drinking from a chalice.
Leader: the Elevated Ignatius Craphand.
7. House Wakelyke: Producers of experimental, low
grade spirits with all manner of highly odd ingredients. Insignia: a grinning, fat-faced sun. Leader: the
Elevated Hoagle Broadmain.­­

Equipment Availability

Mounts and hounds are usually only available at the
market on Colly (see p176).

Fortification Against the Nag-Lord
Bands of crookhorns and other monsters have recently
begun encroaching on the woods close to Prigwort and
Harrowmoor Keep. Lady Harrowmoor is overseeing the
establishment of a fortified garrison in Prigwort, as a
precaution against the war she fears is brewing. The old
Swinney Tower (see hex 1106) is also now reoccupied.

“Yellow be willing”—commonly heard utterance in Prigwort, willing the favour of the fairy Earl of Yellow.

Captain Simwise Hogwash (Level 6 Fighter)
A bristle-bearded human man in his early sixties, his
impeccably polished helmet perpetually strapped upon
his shiny bald head. Goggling eyes and a stiff upper lip
lend him an astonished appearance at all times.

edge, even when drunk. Eye twitches.
Speech: Gentlemanly. Vacillates between barked orders
and mumbled ruminations. Woldish.
Desires: Suspects Austache’s Bounders (p181) of
criminal activity, and wishes to arrest Austache and
shut down the vigilante gang.
House affiliation: House Halthwidden.

1. Town Hall

A large, elaborate building with two pointy ornamental
turrets, an ostentatious, portcullised gate, and a profusion of heraldic shields decorating its tiled walls. This is
the town hall of Prigwort, seat of the Elevated Council of
Brewmasters.
Main hall: A wide, gloomy hall bedecked with heraldic
tapestries bearing the insignias of the seven noble brewing
houses and depicting the greatest Elevated Brewmasters of
the town’s past. When town meetings or legal proceedings
are under way, the members of the Elevated Council are
seated on wooden thrones upon a dais.
Brew cellars: The Elevated Brewmasters curate one of the
town’s greatest treasures: the exquisitely stocked cellars
beneath the town hall. The collection of vintage wines,
spirits, beers, and ciders rivals that of the palaces of kings.
Many of the finest brews in these cellars are products of
the Brewmasters’ own craft.
Town gaol and garrison: A rear entrance leads to the garrison of the Alegard (see p175)—commanded by Captain
Hogwash—and the subterranean gaol.

2. Market Square

A cobbled square whose sides are packed with tall, leaning
stores and public houses. Bustling markets are held here
twice a week.
Colly: Livestock and crafts market. Vehicles, mounts,
hounds, tools, adventuring gear, and basic weapons and
armour can be found for sale.

from the bakery in hex 1206. 2sp per pastry.

3. The Oaf in the Oast
(Tavern and Baths)

An old oast-house converted into a heaving tavern affiliated with House Ogsbody. The exterior walls are coated
in once bright primary colours, now obscured by layers
of thick varnish. Outside are various terracotta pots fashioned as hog-like creatures, trailing a riot of brittle vines
and dead flowers.
Sign: A drunken bumpkin obliviously scratching his
behind as a fire kindles beneath his nethers.
Common room: An arc-shaped mahogany bar in the
cramped roundel is where most serious drinking takes
place. On warm nights the cowl in the lofty roof is opened,
allowing nightly zephyrs to sweep away the fust and fug.
Crowds are served by the landlord Heggid and two buxom
barmaids—Gawda and Blessie—who have the necessary
brawn and bold temperament to shoulder through the
thronging drinkers. Strangers are often pointedly overlooked by the server.
Brewery: The far larger oblong room at back is used as a
store and the small brewery for Heggid’s beers—the landlord and some of his more exclusive clientele sometimes
sullenly drink in here betwixt the looming masses of two
ancient mash tuns.
Guests: A bustle of bawdy locals, mostly manual labourers.
Grimalkins: Are theoretically welcomed, but so are
(mundane) dogs and cats, and all are treated alike.
No fancy folk: Patrons dressed in fancy attire or putting
on fancy airs may be barred on sight, for no real reason.

Services at the Oaf-in-the Oast
Food: Of common quality (DPB).
Heggid’s bitter: Two-pint ceramic steins of Heggid’s Bitter
at 15cp apiece. The steins are worked into faces of rosycheeked barmaids, rather gaudy and alarming.
Baths: In the basement, under the floor of the main bar.
These are only offered to groups of four at a minimum,
it not being worth stoking the fires to heat water otherwise. 1sp per person, attended by Heggid. 1gp per person,
attended by Gawda or Blessie.

Heggid Axminster—Oaf in the Oast Proprietor
A barrel-chested, lantern-jawed human man in his
forties, with hairy forearms and a thatch of matted
blonde hair. Broken teeth and nose do not detract from
an almost noble carriage in the swing of his proud beer
gut. Heggid “has always owned the Oaf and always will.”
Demeanour (Neutral): Attempts to conceal his scheming and sly intellect with feigned absent-mindedness.
Speech: Rough, barely intelligible drawl. Woldish.
Desires: Scheming to set up a clandestine distillery in
his cellars—out of sight of the meddling of the Brewmasters and their tax collectors—and start exporting
cheap liquor to Dreg. To show his mettle defending
Prigwort from any hypothetical invader.
House affiliation: House Ogsbody.

A weaselly human man in his forties, always dressed
to the height of fashion, with curl-toed moccasins and
a moustache to match.

right breed of customer, condescending and abrupt
to the wrong sort. (But may be brought around if his
expert opinion on fashion is deferred to.)

Desires: To see Cantius Croupe—his arch-rival and
chief boudoir-ward of the duke—ridiculed and deposed.

knob and a plaque bearing the inscription “Brandybile’s,

Member of the Esteemed Guild of Tailors. Rogues beware:
affiliate of the Shadow House, Castle Brackenwold.”
By appointment only: Inquiring at the Wrinkled Medlar,
as specified, may gain well-heeled clients an appointment
on the following day.

5. Raptappen’s
Quadrant (Inn)

A squat building of black timber with eggshell-coloured
trim, surrounding a grassy courtyard in which wavers a
single stunted elm. Secure, quiet lodging is on offer here
and, indeed, after dark, wan lights indicate that the majority of the rooms are usually occupied, although the actual
traffic of travellers seen coming and going is negligible.
Sign: A small black sign depicting three concentric yellow
squares and the austere inscription “Raptappen’s.”
Entry hall: The front door leads into an entry hall, lined
with mossy green carpet and dark wood panelling. Here,
politely timorous servant lads clad in rust-coloured livery
and starched ruffs greet guests and lead them through a
maze of passages to one of the many private dining rooms.
Preternatural calm: Throughout Raptappen’s, the atmosphere is one of preternatural calm and quiet, with only the
occasional guest or scurrying servant lad to disrupt the
tableaux of carpeted halls and parlours.
Private dining rooms: Rooms with space for up to fifteen
are available, attended by a dedicated servant lad.
The courtyard: In warmer months, tables are placed in the
courtyard, beneath lanterns hanging from the inn’s eaves.
The courtyard boasts several ancient sets of traditional
lawn games such as quoits and skittles.

Interior: A series of elegantly appointed chambers containing the workshops, display racks, and boudoirs of this highclass tailor. As if to confirm the establishment’s connection
with the Shadow House, the place is lit by candles that
flicker on and off as clients walk between rooms.

Guests: Other guests are rarely seen, though titters and
muttering from closed rooms intimate their presence.

Wards: As the plaque on the exterior door implies, the
premises are warded by sorcery. Use of magic within the
shop causes a small silver bell to tinkle. Items removed
from the shop without the proprietor’s permission are
cursed: the thief must Save Versus Hold or be transformed
permanently into a hog.

Wines: All uncommon wines always are in stock and there
is a 3-in-6 chance of any rare wine being available. Guests
ordering wine may meet the proprietor, Aspith Raptappen,
who personally brings bottles up from the cellars.

Services at Brandybile’s
Fine clothing: Tailoring of fancy outfits comes at 50gp
upwards (depending on the material, embellishments,
etc.).
Embroidery: Brandybile can enhance existing clothing
with emblems, coats of arms, etc. for 25gp upwards.

p133), Brandybile can tailor clothing suitable for subsequent enchantment (at double the normal cost of the clothing). He can also directly commission the enchantments
via his contacts in the guild.

Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB).

A sighing human woman in her 50s, of gaunt, saturnine aspect, appearing of noble parentage. Dresses in

Demeanour (Neutral): Disarming serenity and charm.
The grace and poise of a dancer. Has a reckless streak.
Speech: Hypnotically melodic. Woldish.

8. The Wrinkled Medlar
(Inn)

A three-winged building whose ground floor is constructed
of timeworn stone blocks and two upper floors are woodbeamed and painted with murals of the town market. The
Wrinkled Medlar cultivates the reputation of “luxury away
from home” and caters to cultured travellers with the need
to enter Dolmenwood.

Desires: Adventure, excitement, and scandalous
romance. The treasure hoard her grandfather (who
founded the Sea of Stars) claims to have buried on a
remote island in his seafaring days. She has a map.

Sign: A dog’s paw reaching towards a desiccated medlar
fruit atop a luxurious cushion of purple velvet.

Possessions: A slim, silver Ring of Invisibility (p410).

Common room: A curated balance between dim, rustic
cosiness and timeless elegance. Tables are decked with
linen, candles, and silver cutlery and liveried waiters serve
guests at their seats. Double staircases lead to the intimate
“evening bar”overlooking the broad stage at the opposite
end of the room.

House affiliation: House Pilston.

7. The Sea of Stars
(Jeweller)

A tall, narrow store, four storeys high, painted with pearls,
mermaids, and gaudy nautical scenes.
Sign: A flotsam of bejewelled goblets and caskets, drifting
on a tranquil sea.
Interior: A luxurious suite, with floral upholstered
couches, elegant oil paintings, and display cases of
polished, inlaid wood. The proprietor, Hague Jerricorn,
greets clients from behind a grand consulting desk. The
upper floors are off limits to customers, occupied by the
safe room and the proprietor’s private lodgings.
Guards: 6 guards (Level 1 fighters—DMB) armed with
crossbows and swords. Three stand discreetly outside the
store, with three more guarding the safe room.

of decent quality (50–500gp).

Strict door policy: Those unsuitably dressed (e.g. wearing
armour or carrying weapons) are denied entry.

Musical performances: The inn is renowned as the finest
musical venue in Prigwort, under the discerning eye of the
resident delegate of the Bardic Guild, Sprewdiman Kneeve,
who keeps a small office behind the stage. Kneeve can be
seen sitting with critical attention during performances
and flitting between tables to lap up his share of praise
after a particularly successful show.

entourages of guards, servants, and hangers-on.

Waylaine

A rambling structure whose original, narrow nave has
been extended over time with many side-chapels in differing styles and antiquities.
Entrance: An extravagant portal framed by seven concentric arches, carved with scenes of angels raising the souls
of the dead up to heaven. The entrance is angled such that
it is immediately visible to travellers entering Prigwort
through the Turret Gate.
Interior: The long, narrow nave, lined with pillars of
gleaming white marble, gives a direct view onto the altar,
bathed in coloured light filtering through the stained glass

11. The Groaning Gate

A squat stone gate topped with a covered wooden lookout
post, painted with the image of a sea serpent.

12. Turret Gate

An ornamental, turreted gate, with portcullis and guard
posts. The tops of the turrets stand fully twice the height
of the town wall. The entrance to the Church of St Waylaine
is visible to travellers passing through the Turret Gate.

13. Abbey Gate

A stone gate topped with a battlement. The gate is flanked
on each side by a statue of a bishop.
Alms: Coins dropped in slots in the statues’ palms are
collected in alms boxes, dating from the days when
pilgrims would stop in Prigwort on their way to the Abbey
of St Clewyd (hex 0906). Proceeds go to the local church.

14. The Bagwall

A crumbling brick wall that mirrors the course of the main
town wall for a quarter of its length. The Bagwall is the
remnant of a failed attempt by the semi-mythical Lord
Bag-in-Hand to establish a manorial estate in the outskirts
of Prigwort (see The Tale of Lord Bag-in-Hand).
In local parlance: The Bagwall is a running joke among the
locals, who use the phrase “when the Bagwall’s finished” to
indicate something that is highly unlikely to occur.

15. Bag Manor

The Tale of Lord Bag-in-Hand
Some centuries ago, an eccentric noble, known in folktales as Lord Bag-In-Hand, had mind to build a manor
on the outskirts of Prigwort. There was but one catch:
he was mortally afraid of the squirrels (or badgers, or
fairies—the tales vary) that frequent the region. Undeterred, he commissioned the construction of a wall
around the site of the manor, with polished mirrors
affixed to its outer side to repel the offensive creatures.
After a year of work, the builders upped and left, claiming that their employer had simply vanished. No more
was heard of Lord Bag-In-Hand.
Some believe that he died of the plague, alone in a
distant land. Others claim that he was, in fact, the Earl
of Yellow in disguise, playing a prank or granting some
mysterious boon upon the people of Prigwort.

Mostlemyre Drouge—Consulting Magician
(Level 8 Magician)
A fat human man in his late 50s, with a shaven head
and pudgy, clammy hands clad with bejewelled rings
(one of which is enchanted—see Possessions). Dresses

Demeanour (Neutral): Wry, abstruse. Forthright and
businesslike in his dealings with strangers. Has a

several obscure otherworldly tongues.

A roomy, thatch-roofed residence of several rambling
wings. Hereditary home of the wealthy Drouge family,
prominent members of the brewing house Oberon. Despite
its name, Bag Manor has no relation to the semi-mythical
Lord Bag-in-Hand (see The Tale of Lord Bag-in-Hand), but
was constructed at a later date on the site he had supposedly selected for his manor.

Desires: Spells, tomes, and magic items related to scrying and other dimensions. Seeks a copy of the infamous
tome of summoning magic, the Black Book of Llareggub.

Inhabitants: The manor is the residence of Mostlemyre
Drouge, famed consulting magician and elder scion of
the Drouge clan. Drouge lives alone, attended by three
mysterious, black-wreathed servitors who speak only in
curt whispers.

Possessions: A ruby Ring of Protection (p410). A Talisman of Spell Reflection (p398, 5 charges). A Wand of
Phantasm (7 charges). Spell books: Rank 1 Decipher,

inhabits the bookshelves in the study. Guests may spot
it during consultations, manifesting as a quizzical, longnosed face in the wood of the shelves. The demi-gnod
absorbs the knowledge of books placed in its shelves and
addresses Drouge in an obscure magical language, acting
as a quick index.

16. The Clashed Antler
(Inn)

A rustic, two-storey building with a thatched roof and
sturdy black oak beams, similar in style to Bag Manor.
The inn is supposedly located on a site intended for the
grounds and outbuildings of Lord Bag-In-Hand’s manor
(see The Tale of Lord Bag-in-Hand).
Sign: Two stags (one purple, one orange) locking horns
against a backdrop of blue stars.
Common room: Grandly rustic, with thick beams, intimately cramped nooks and crannies, comfortingly low
ceilings, and a horseshoe bar that looks solid enough to
withstand a battering ram. Customers are served by the
octogenarian proprietors, Sespettra and Blino Jongle.
Guests: A small number of cringing travellers and locals
amid a roistering crowd of youths who call themselves
Austache’s Bounders. Driven by booze, boredom, and
braggadocio, these rambunctious toughs spell trouble for
any ill-mannered visitor.
Beer garden: A sprawling beer garden with lamps of purple
and orange glass dotted amongst the trees and large wagon
wheels for tables. The garden is bounded by the Bagwall
(to the north) and a wooden fence (to the west), but bleeds
directly into the eaves of Dolmenwood at several points,
where the wall is crumbled to rubble. Although they have
been asked repeatedly not to, Austache’s Bounders often
enter the premises directly from the woods rather than via
the main entrance on Harrow Road.

Services at the Clashed Antler
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB).
Private cottages: Located in the beer garden. Somewhat
shabby and musty, but serviceable. 1gp per person per
night, including a simple breakfast. Each cottage can
accommodate six.
Bundt cake: Sespettra bakes an immense bundt cake twice
a week—on Moot and Sunning—slices of which are free to
all patrons, as well as passing beggars.

Blino Jongle—Clashed Antler Proprietor
An elderly human man, once proud and strong-backed,
now doddery and enfeebled. His bald pate is dotted
with liver spots and his spit-soaked grey moustaches
hang limply down to his chest. Dresses in a shabby
black suit.
Demeanour (Lawful): Feeble, familiar, forgetful.
Will not have a bad word said about his great-nephew
Austache, but looks on in silent reproach during his
debauches, fretfully hand-wringing and chewing his
moustaches.
Speech: Faltering, whistling. Woldish.
Desires: To find a good, dependable woman for
Austache to settle down with or, failing that, a strict
employer to keep him out of trouble.
House affiliation: House Cobsworth.

Austache’s Bounders—Vigilante Gang
Purpose: Formed under the loose motivation to drive
out criminals deemed “wrong-uns” from Prigwort. The
manifesto detailing what constitutes a “wrong-un” is
kept in Austache’s jerkin and is constantly edited and
re-edited as circumstances dictate. The gang spends as
much time raising hell at the Clashed Antler as it does
tracking down ne’er-do-wells.
Membership: Two dozen local youths, primarily
apathetic scions of better-off families. The Bounders
are mostly lads, but include a number of rowdy young
women. While some of the members are passionate
about law enforcement, most just like the mystique that
comes with declaring oneself a vigilante.
Current scheme: Harassment of any non-humans they
spot, on the imagined grounds that they are spies of
the Nag-Lord.

Austache Jongle—Vigilante Leader
An awkward, pudgy human man in his early thirties
(significantly older than most of his gang), with misty
blue eyes and unkempt blonde hair and beard. Dresses
in a ridiculous, harlequin patchwork of coloured cloth.
Austache is the great-nephew of Sespettra and Blino
Jongle, elderly proprietors of the Clashed Antler.
Demeanour (Neutral): Ungainly and careless. Shaky
hands caused by early-onset alcoholism.
Speech: Loud whooping and jeering. Woldish.
Desires: To remain young and carefree. To recruit more
members to his gang—including adventurous types!—
and set up continuous patrols around Prigwort, on the
lookout for “wrong-uns.”
House affiliation: House Cobsworth.

17. Harrow Road

A narrow, twisting forest road, just wide enough for a cart
at the point where it leaves Prigwort. Harrow Road widens
as it winds its way north towards the gates of Harrowmoor
Keep (hex 1105).

18. Swinney Road

A well-maintained, much-frequented trade road that leads
from Prigwort to Fort Vulgar. Also once an important
pilgrimage route—Swinney Road passes the foot of the
(now ruined) Abbey of St Clewyd (hex 0906).

19. Construction Site

Piled beside the wall to the north of the Abbey Gate are
rapidly growing heaps of brick, stone, and lumber. This site
is being prepared for the construction of a garrison, at the
instruction of Lady Harrowmoor and the duke.

20. Horse-Eye Road

A well-maintained, much-frequented trade road that
connects Castle Brackenwold and Prigwort.

Woodcutters’
Encampment
1109—Archaic
1109
—Archaic village of loggers and wood-crafters on the verge of Hag’s Addle.

O

nce truly a mere encampment in the woods, now
a village proper and thriving trade community,
known as “the Camp” for short. Streets of tall
wood-panelled, clay-roofed buildings are lined with tidy
rows of coppiced hazel, beech, and oak. Houses in the
western part of the village rest on short stilts to alleviate
flooding from the nearby swamp. A small stream named
Sundiman’s Beck flows through the streets in little cobblestone channels beside the thoroughfare.
Inhabitants (180—village): Almost exclusively folk of
Woodcutter stock, tall and hirsute.
Ruler: Jollie Oistace Pollard (see p328—resident in
Ferneddbole House, hex 1209), representative of House
Mulbreck, in whose domain the village lies. (“Jollie
Oistace”—or the “Lumbermaster”—is a hereditary title
among the Woodcutters, akin to a minor lord.)
Religion: The Woodcutters faithfully serve the Pluritine
Church.
Rumours: See Rumours in the Woodcutters’ Encampment,
p453.

The Dying Art of Furnging
In addition to their work as simple loggers and woodcrafters, the Woodcutters traditionally practice an art known as
“furnging”—the coppicing and maintenance of trees with
a view to heightening the innate properties of the wood.
The most refined arts of furnging are applied over several
human lifespans and result in timbers with unusual and
even magical qualities.

The Softening of the Woodcutter Life
In recent years, the once hardy Woodcutters are grown
indolent on the profits of trade, softened by the comforts
of civilised life. The furnging-woods are still maintained
by a stalwart few, but ever half-heartedly.

Mock But Secretly Fear the Drune
The Woodcutters have dwelt in Dolmenwood since antiquity, arriving alongside the Drune (see History, p14).
While the two groups once worked in tandem, each benefiting from the other’s knowledge, these days are now only
recognised in folktale. In the modern day, while affecting a boisterous mockery and disdain for the Drune (see
The Mocking of the Drune), each and every Woodcutter
harbours a lurking fear of them at the back of their mind.
Shun Drune country: Woodcutters are reluctant to travel
further west than Lankshorn (hex 0710) and refuse utterly
to trespass into Dwelmfurgh, the heart of Drune country.

182

The Mocking of the Drune
Unlike other folk of Dolmenwood, the Woodcutters do
not fear to utter the word “Drune.” Indeed, they tend
to dismiss the cabal’s existence as superstition and
laughingly engage in a ritual known as “the mocking
of the Drune.” Of an evening, one of the locals gathered
in the Stump and Poniard calls out “Oistace-kyne arise,
Baggle-men bedroggle!” The caller then rushes outside
to ring the Drounbell, showing their fearlessness of the
Drune, before returning and buying a round of drinks.
These antics continue through the evening, typically
with ever-increasing zeal and disrespect. Visitors to the
Woodcutters’ Encampment are encouraged to join in.
Meaning of the call: “Oistace-kyne” is the Woodcutters’
name for themselves; “Baggle-men” is a local (flippant)
name for the Drune; “bedroggle” is a word meaning to
cast an unwanted item (or person) into a sodden ditch.
All of these words are of Drunic origin.

Bordering the Hag’s Domain
Dwelling on the edge of Hag’s Addle, the Woodcutters whisper fearfully of the Hag (p82), who is said to haunt the
village outskirts at night, bewitching any who glimpse her
lantern. Many who venture into the swamp to forage or fish
claim to have encountered the Hag, though the veracity of
such tales is uncertain.

The River Trade
The River Hameth runs wide and shallow at this point,
rich with fish and floating debris from the forest. Boats
and barges carry goods and passengers along two routes:
East-west: The seven-mile river journey between Dreg and
the Woodcutters’ Encampment forms a vital link in the
trade route between Castle Brackenwold (in the east) and
High-Hankle and Lankshorn (in the west).
North-south: Trade between Dolmenwood and the lands
to the south travels along the Hameth, via Dreg, the Woodcutters’ Encampment, and the wondrous ship-conveyor at
the Falls of Nyf (see hex 1112).

Equipment Availability
Vehicles and mounts cost 50% more than usual.

1. Camp Road

A broad, well-maintained cobbled road leading to Castle
Brackenwold.

2. The Kissing Stone

An obelisk of black marble stands by the roadside. A white
rope is braided around its centre.
Kissing the stone: Woodcutters traditionally kneel and
kiss the stone when returning from the woods, claiming
that doing so brings good fortune and health.
Engraved script: Upon close examination, worn remnants
of an inscription may be noted at the rear of the stone. The
script is Old Drunic (which few living understand) and tells
of the presence of a “water weird” named Gheillough in the
great lake, said to be a source of great power to the Drune.

Hagbard Sundiman—Elder Woodcutter
A remarkably hale, bear-like human man in his eighties, his dark eyes almost lost in the tangle of his russet
hair and beard. Dresses in scratched leather and a squirrel-skin hat (complete with tail).
Demeanour (Lawful): Dour, God-fearing, suspicious of
“soft-skins” (i.e. non-loggers), brutally honest. Habitually chews pine sap.
Speech: Gruff, curt. Woldish.
Desires: To bring about a new dawn of Woodcutter
culture by awakening the Jollie Oistace from his indolence. A complete exorcism of his manor (hex 1209) may
prove necessary.

4. Lumbermaster’s Lodge

5. Marrowbold’s Smoke
Shop

An impressive, two-storey log cabin / manor, with exceptionally large trunks for corner posts. Originally the Jollie
Oistace’s residence, the lodge is now used as a meeting
house by the elders who maintain the art of furnging.

Sign: A shorthorn breggle looking with surprise at a quizzical face coalescing in the wisps rising from his pipe.

Entrance: A single, heavily furnged slab of ancient oak. A
multitude of whimsical visages can be seen amid the structure of its whorls and grain. As visitors approach, the little
faces animate, peering curiously at those who would enter.

A thatched cottage with two wooden towers out the back,
used for drying herbs.

Interior: A cramped, soothingly dim space whose meticulously packed shelves loom reassuringly over visitors. The
proprietor, Megwynne Marrowbold, smiles from behind a
felt-clad counter, polishing pipes with a cloth. Above her, a
range of peculiar pipes are displayed on plaques.

Services at Marrowbold’s
Standard pipes and pipeleaf: The pipes and leaves listed
in the DPB are sold at the standard prices. Common and
uncommon leaves are always available, and there is a
3-in-6 chance of rare leaves being in stock.
Magical pipeleafs: There is a 2-in-6 chance of each of the
following being in stock: Mallow-Puff, Purple Shag, Sticky
Gilly, Wanton Wisp. See Rare Comestibles, p426.
Enchanted pipes: The peculiar pipes hanging above the
counter are of antiquated mossling manufacture and
are enchanted with a variety of minor dweomers (blows
purple smoke, blows wyrm-shaped smoke rings, plays
jingling melodies when smoked, etc.). Each costs 100gp.

Megwynne Marrowbold—Marrowbold’s
Proprietor
A plump, bespectacled human woman in her sixties,
with plaited, grey hair down to her ankles. Dresses in
chunky wool and an oiled leather apron. Megwynne is
an expert on matters of pipeleaf and smoking.
Demeanour (Lawful): Enthusiastic (insists customers
sample at least half a dozen weeds).
Speech: Convivial, slow. Woldish.
Desires: Rare and unusual pipes and weeds. To publish
her life’s work: a rambling collection of treatises on
pipeleaf through the ages.

184

Interior: A lofty space with beams and panels of fragrant
wood. A round table and stools, carved from an unusual,
purple-hued wood. Mighty saws and gargantuan rounds
of wood decorate the walls. A library of decaying books
contains the secrets of furnging, recorded in a code passed
down over generations.
Inhabitants: In the day, the lodge is empty. One evening in
three, a hoary collection of village elders gathers here and
gravely schemes to revive the rapidly dying art of furnging.
Chief among them is Hagbard Sundiman.

Services at the Lumbermaster’s Lodge
The elder Woodcutters may be willing to sell furnged wood
(either as raw lumber or crafted items) to interested parties.
Wood furnged for flame resistance is the most commonly
desired product, but woods with more exotic qualities
(e.g. the strength of steel, great elasticity, incorporeality
beneath moonlight) are sometimes available at high prices.

5. Port

An assortment of piers, fishing boats, and lumber barges.
Boats to Dreg: Passage on a boat or barge along the sevenmile stretch of river to Dreg can be bought here for 2sp
per foot passenger, 5sp per horse, and 2gp per vehicle. The
journey takes 11/2 hours.

6. The Drounbell

A great, weathered copper bell standing on a wooden platform at the riverside, beneath a clay-tiled roof. The bell is
carved with the antlered head of a stag.
The Mocking of the Drune: Tipsy locals rush here to vigorously ring the bell as part of their ritual “Mocking of the
Drune” (see p182).

Part Five | Set tlements

7. The Stump and
Poniard (Tavern)

A long, low wooden shack on the edge of the forest. A tree
trunk pierces the roof of the tavern, with a chimney on
either side.
Sign: A slim dagger stuck in the side of a great stump.
Common room: A draughty, smoky, sawdust-floored space,
little more than a barn. Not a stool or table can be found.
The landlord, Jock Furngle, serves from a circular bar
surrounding a varnished trunk that pierces the roof. Meats
roast in a pair of fireplaces. In the evening, fiddle-players
and barn-dances intermingle with drinkers.
Guests: Merry locals, river workers, traders, and the occasional adventuring party.

Services at the Stump and Poniard
Food: Of common quality (DPB).

8. Church of St Foggarty
A tall church constructed of varnished wooden staves,
overlooking Hag’s Addle. In its tower, a pale yellow flame
burns, lighthouse-like, guiding lost travellers to safety.

Entrance: A towering, unadorned wooden door, which is
often locked in the day, when the vicar wanders the swamp.
Interior: A tall circular space with a serene pinewood
aroma. An oaken idol of St Foggarty—depicted holding a
lantern to guide the lost—stands opposite the door.

Jock Furngle—Stump and Poniard Proprietor
A stout, round-faced human man in his forties, with
twinkling brown eyes, a mop of black hair, and ruddy
cheeks.
Demeanour (Neutral): Grinning and affable. Scheming,
untrustworthy, and entirely unscrupulous.
Speech: Rustic, slow and circuitous. Woldish.
Knowledge: Has heard of the fungal infestation in
Bogwitt Manor (hex 1210) and addiction of the nobles.
Desires: To supply Jollie Oistace Pollard (p328) with
fungi acquired from Bogwitt Manor (particularly Devil’s
Grease), with the aim of establishing an addiction.

10. The Merry Mendicant
(Inn)

A five-storey building so narrow that it looks almost like a
tower. The inn is the tallest building in the village.
Sign: A grinning friar polishing his pate with beeswax.
Common room: A symphony of carven wood—sylvan
statues clutching oil lamps peek out from little nooks
and alcoves, delightful woodland dioramas form a frieze
around the room, and dark beams worked into the shape of
ivy-clad branches radiate out from the bar. The bar itself is
constructed entirely of polished cherry-wood, with a pair
of 8′-high friars toasting the health of guests, one on each
side of the bar. The landlady, Clement Brancher, serves
amid this atmosphere of amiable rustic ease.

Populace: Lone locals in prayer. The vicar, Father Horsely,
sits quietly with his shaggy dog, Clewyd, at his feet.

Guests: Contented locals, travellers, and merchants.

Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of
St Foggarty: the ability to cast Light. See Shrines, p22.

Services at the Merry Mendicant

Father Jymes Horsely—Vicar of the
Woodcutters’ Encampment
A stick-thin human man in his fifties, with pale, greyish
skin, wispy white hair, and darting grey eyes. Spends
much of his time wandering in Hag’s Addle with his
dog, Clewyd.

Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB).
Addle mead: A rich, herby mead is brewed in the inn’s
cellars, from the honey of the beehives that stand among

cares deeply about the plight of the suffering.

Clement Brancher—Merry Mendicant
Proprietor

Speech: Awkward stammering. Woldish, Liturgic.

A slender human woman in her twenties, with a mass
of curly red hair and beady brown eyes. Dresses in traditional male Woodcutter garb: green tweed jacket and
tight white breeches. Has no knowledge of the Woodcutter life, having moved here from Castle Brackenwold
after inheriting the inn from her grandfather.

Knowledge: Expert on the paths of Hag’s Addle.
Desires: To map Hag’s Addle and drive out the Hag.

9. The Oistace Tree

A huge, wild-limbed oak tree allegedly over 1,000 years
old, its larger branches propped up on supports. The grassy
area at the foot of the oak is roped off for use in weddings
and village dances.

Demeanour (Neutral): Warm, wry, somewhat baffled.
Loves dogs and cats. Fondly predisposed towards
grimalkins.
Speech: Leisurely, familiar. Woldish.

hether you’ve been out into the wild twice in your

Dolmenwood always holds another delightful

enchanting place in spite of all the fearful talk you might hear
in the tales of mortal folk. Not that it’s without its dangers,
mind you. But the danger is part of the joy, and I think mortals
know that—even if they don’t realise it. You just have to let go

Hex Description Format
The various statistics and entries by which hexes are described.

T

he Dolmenwood campaign map is divided into
200 hexes, each encompassing an area 6 miles
across. The following 200 pages of this book each
describe one hex on the map, listed in numerical order—
from the north-west corner of the map to the south-east.
These one-page hex descriptions detail the most mysterious, magical, useful, and dangerous features located
within each hex. The format in which they are presented
is explained here.

1. Header

The header at the top of each hex description page lists a
few basic facts about the hex.

Hex Number
The hex’s number, for referencing it on the campaign map.

Name
Each hex has a name, giving a brief indication of what
might be discovered there.

Flavour Text
A brief description of the sights, sounds, smells, and atmosphere of the hex. Describe this flavour to the players when
their characters enter a hex. Read the flavour text aloud or
convey it in your own words.

2. Geographical Info

Beneath the header, on the left of the page, boxed text
notes relevant geographical information about the hex.

Terrain
The hex’s terrain type (e.g. fungal forest, meadow, swamp,
etc.—see Travel, DPB) is listed, along with the region or
regions in which it is located (e.g. Aldweald, Mulchgrove,
etc.—see Regions of Dolmenwood, p8).
Terrain type: A hex’s terrain type determines the party’s
travel speed and whether mounts or vehicles can be used.
See Travel, DPB.
Travel Point cost: The Travel Point cost to enter or search
the hex is noted in parentheses. See Travel, DPB.
Region: The region in which a hex is located determines
the types of creatures that might be encountered. See
Encounters, p114.

Lost / Encounters
Lists an X-in-6 chance used for rolls for losing direction and
for encounter checks while in the hex.
Losing direction: The X-in-6 chance of getting lost when
travelling wild under normal conditions, based on the
hex’s terrain type. Extreme weather conditions increase
this chance. See Travel, DPB.
Chance of encounters: The X-in-6 chance of an encounter
occurring if a random encounter check is rolled in this
hex. See Travel, DPB.
Special encounters: If an encounter is rolled while characters are in the hex, some hexes note a separate chance that
a special encounter may occur. Special encounters are typically with creatures resident in the hex. If the chance for
the special encounter comes up, the encounter is with the
specified creature; otherwise roll on the standard encounter table for the hex’s region (see Encounters, p114).

Ley Lines
If a ley line passes through the hex, its basic effects are
noted as a reminder to the Referee. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18.

Foraging
Edible fungi and plants can be found in any hex (see Foraging, p118). Successful foraging in some hexes also yields
unusual or magical species, for example those described
in Part Seven: Treasures and Oddments, p390 or in
Common Herbs and Fungi, DPB.

3. Local Area Map

Beneath the header, on the right of the page, is a section
of the Referee’s map, showing the hex and neighbouring
hexes.
Current hex: The hex described is outlined in yellow.
Hyperlinks: In the PDF edition of this book, clicking on a
surrounding hex jumps to its description.

Hex Dimensions
Flat side to opposite side: 6 miles.
Centre to flat side: 3 miles.
Corner to opposite corner: 7 miles.
Centre to corner: 31/2 miles.
Edge (corner to corner): 31/2 miles.

Expanding Hex Locations
Each hex on the campaign map covers an area of nearly
32 square miles. Given this scope, the hex descriptions
in this book necessarily only note and detail the most
significant features in each hex.
Expanding features: The Referee may wish to flesh
out features described in this book in more detail,
as required. For example, locations such as lairs and
domiciles could be expanded into full adventure sites,
with a map and appropriate treasure (see Designing
Dungeons, p96).
Adding features: The Referee may wish to add wholly
new, additional features to hexes. For example, a
dungeon adventure could be placed in a hex on the
Dolmenwood map. In the case of hexes PCs have fully
explored or frequently travel through, adding new
features keeps the environment fresh and surprising.

4. Features

Each hex notes one or more features of interest that characters might encounter while passing through: islands,
tombs, inns, lairs, strange pools, settlements, castles, and
so on.

Hidden Features
Some features are marked as “Hidden.” Parties spending
extra time to search the hex discover such features. See
Travel, DPB.
Revealing features: When a party searches a hex, the
Referee may wish to reveal all hidden features, one feature
per search, or give a chance (e.g. 2-in-6) of finding a hidden
feature per search.

Non-Hidden Features
Other features (those not marked as “Hidden”) are encountered by parties passing through the hex.
Travelling by road: The Referee may need to use judgement as to which features a party encounters when passing
through a hex by road. For example, a feature located deep
in the woods may be missed by a party simply travelling
along a road without making any detours.

Map Features
Note that many hexes have obvious, large-scale features
indicated on the campaign map—rivers, marshes, islands,
roads, etc. These are only specifically described if they are
of especial interest.

The Spectral Manse
A barren expanse of stagnant pools. The keening wind carries strains of distant violin music.

Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with a bewildered banshee (DMB) heading to a ball
at the Spectral Manse.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Bosun’s Balm (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

The Spectral Manse
A thicket of twisted blackthorns stands amid a treacherous region of rivulets and sodden moss carpets. Those
who push through the tangled branches arrive at a bluetinged, spectral vision of a baroque manor of dark wood,
its windows lit with the veiled glow of firelight behind
drawn curtains. Strains of plaintive violin music can be
heard from somewhere within.
Entering: The front door opens freely, or a window can
be forced.
Interior: The manor exists in an odd dimension, halfway
between Fairy and the mortal world. Interior walls appear
skewed, passages twist at odd angles, and rooms seem to
expand and contract as characters move through them.
Violin music drifts in the air, though its origin is unclear.
Inhabitants: Lord Hobbled-and-Blackened is imprisoned
in the manse with a number of spectral guests.
Exploring: Roll on the Rooms and Encounters tables for
each room entered. Each room connects to 1d3 other
rooms, via crooked doors and lurching hallways.
Leaving: With the exception of any of Lord Hobbled-andBlackened’s possessions, items from the manse evaporate
into mist when taken into the real world.

Lord Hobbled-and-Blackened
A gaunt, icicle-thin frost elf courtier (DMB) dressed in

Lord Hobbled-and-Blackened, manically playing a
violin. He beseeches PCs to take a letter to Ygraine
(declaring his love for her and pleading for her aid in
escaping the manse). In return he offers his violin.
1d4 sleek, silver hounds (use seelie dog stats, DPB)
growl and may attack non-Neutral aligned characters
entering the room.
An aged elven lady with violet eyes and white,
frost-clad hair in an extravagant beehive, waltzing
and pirouetting to violin music. If asked to dance,
she gladly accepts (partner must Save Versus Hold
or be whisked away into the Prince’s Road—see
Fairy Roads, p26); otherwise she attacks any who
disturb her (treat as a banshee, DMB).
2 haughty frost elf courtiers (DMB). Roll 1d6: 1. Trysting, 2. Dancing ponderously, 3. Arguing about musical
notes, 4. Looking for Lord Hobbled-and-Blackened
(their host), 5. Lounging disinterestedly, 6. Duelling.
A portrait of a beautiful mortal woman dressed in a
regal fur robe with a brilliant diamond upon her brow
(Ygraine Mordlin, p84). The frame is carved with
plaintive faces, weeping icy tears.
Furnishings dance to the strains of violin music. A
grandfather clock groans and grates, its hands stuck
at seven-past-noon. Opening the clock and fixing the
mechanism (a silver dagger is stuck inside) causes the
hands to start moving and slowly accelerate, along
with the tempo of the violin music. Upon returning
to the mortal world, 1d12 days have passed.
A raging wind rips a window and its curtains from
their fittings and proceeds to suck the room’s
contents outside into the dark. PCs must Save Versus
Hold or be ejected back into the mortal world, the
manor disappearing until the next full moon.
A great white stag’s head has fallen from its mounting
and lays on the carpet, moaning mournfully.

Reedwall­

0102

Banks of tall reeds and thickets of gnarled bog willow form a natural labyrinth. Passage is laborious.
Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Sage Toe (p430), in addition to the normal results.

Reedwall
Among the great walls of reeds and willows (6′ tall and
often 20′ or more thick), this hex is dotted with slurping
pools of thick, black mud.
Getting lost: Characters who get lost in this hex spend the
day wandering in circles, unable to find a way out of the
maze. They remain lost in the hex until their daily check
for losing direction does not indicate getting lost again.
Bones in the mud: The remains of unfortunates who
perished here are visible in some of the mud pools. Searching these may reveal small treasures: 3d6cp, 1d6sp, and a
random item (see Leavings in the Mud) or human or woodgrue trinket (DPB).
At night: At night, wisps of mauve, indigo, and orange mist
drift from the mire. Characters who fall asleep here must
Save Versus Doom or be stricken with a state of dreamlessness lasting for 2d6 days. See Effects of Dreamlessness.

Leavings in the Mud (d6)
Each item can be found only once. Re-roll duplicates if
players search repeatedly.

A finely detailed 8″ wooden figurine of a barrowbogey
(DMB) worth 2gp. The jug head is removable, revealing a compartment containing three bunches of
human hair, each tightly bound in catgut.
A mini-cask of Cobsworth Pale Ale (DPB, 4gp / 8 pints).
Surprisingly, it is unspoiled. Sadly, it is unlabelled.
A pair of rotting, putrid, severed human lower legs,
held together at the ankles with rusting manacles.
The manacles bear the crest of House Murkin.
A leather scroll tube sealed with wax. Inside is a crude
map of the region around the Upper Hameth. There
is an “X” drawn at a point corresponding to hex 0202,
with the Liturgic word “Sedge” next to it. (This indicates the location of the lost Shrine to St Sedge.)
A pair of professionally carved ivory dice. Rolling
them repeatedly shows them to be loaded: one
favouring 6, the other favouring 1. (If one of the dice is
thrown, roll 1d8, with 1–6 indicating the rolled result,
and 7 or 8 indicating the favoured number.)
A delicate porcelain doll of an elf, one arm missing.
An hour after being cleaned off, the doll stands up,
appraises her surroundings, curtsies to the PCs, and
with a wry and playful look, vanishes. She reappears
clad in finery, smiling and with arm intact, for 1d3
nights in a random PC’s dreams.

Effects of Dreamlessness
Wisdom loss: –1 Wisdom every second day. A character
reaching 0 Wisdom becomes utterly vacant, lost in a
world of phantasms. Once dreams return, lost Wisdom
is recovered at a rate of 1 point per night’s rest.
Difficulty memorising illusions: A character attempting to memorise a spell of illusion (e.g. Phantasm, Invisibility, etc.) must make a Save Versus Spell or fail to
memorise it—the spell memorisation slot remains
empty.

0103

The Golden Goose
A vastness containing nothing but carpets of red, orange, and ochre moss. The wind howls.

Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Sidney’s Company
Roaming the featureless bogland is a small band of
humans, miserable but determined.
Members: Sidney Tew, 4 minor nobles, and 4 ruffians
(Level 1 thieves—DMB) on the hunt for a “golden goose
that lays golden eggs.”
The hunt: Two weeks ago, a scavenger from Fort Vulgar
sighted a “golden goose” here and found one of its golden
eggs. He sold his egg and story to Sidney Tew, whose gang
of second-son minor nobles and hangers-on headed out to
find it before anyone else. The party is now (unknowingly)
only a day away from discovering Crocus’s Cave.
Approaching: Sidney is suspicious but outwardly welcoming. He cannot help but brag about his search and shows
the golden egg to those who doubt his claims.

Crocus’s Cave (Hidden)
A large but obscured opening in the moss carpet leads
downward into a sodden, high-ceilinged stone cave, filled
with piles of reeds, bones, and shiny objects.
Inhabitants: The monstrous Crocus lies in wait here. She
is accompanied by the Golden Goose, who is bound by a
silver chain (100gp) and gagged with a cloth.
Treasure hoard: Amongst a collection of broken glass,
polished metal, and worthless trinkets is 673cp, 432sp,
925gp, four golden eggs, and a pewter Talisman of Non-Detection (p398) shaped like a bisected eye.

Sidney Tew
A handsome human man in his 30s, with dashing
blonde hair and sharp eyes, hailing originally from
Prigwort. Dresses like a travelling noble, though his
clothes are well-worn. Introduces himself as a cousin
of the Lady Harrowmoor (p60)—this is true, though
he is only a third cousin, once removed.
Demeanour (Neutral): Friendly and charming, but
always looking for an angle. Will use a person, then
feel bad about it to feel better about it.
Speech: Feigned noble affect. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: To find the golden goose. To assume a place of
proper nobility and be recognised as a man of worth.
He has engaged in innumerable failed schemes to do so,
this goose venture being only the latest. If he survives,
he will soon attempt another.
Rewards: Promises a future payment in golden eggs in
exchange for the PCs’ assistance in obtaining the goose.
Possessions: A silver longsword engraved with the Tew
name (110gp).
Combat stats: Level 3 fighter (DMB).

192

Crocus
A 10′ tall ogre-like fairy. She has no skin, just exposed
muscle and patches of scab-like scales. Her lipless
mouth is set in a permanent smile. Her fingers are
tipped by teeth instead of nails. Until recently, avoiding her betrayed mistress Thorn-Rosy (p32) was
her highest priority. Having finally grown too bored
of hiding in a cave and eating wildlife, she now deliberately allows travellers to sight the goose, attracting
greedy mortals to feed upon.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Crude and brutish.
Speech: Guttural growls and grunts. Basic Woldish,
Sylvan.
Desires: To feed and be amused, to avoid the wrath of
Thorn-Rosy, and to be surrounded by shiny things.
Combat stats: Ogre (DMB). As a fairy, suffers 1 extra
point of damage when hit with cold iron weapons.

The Golden Goose
An immortal goose with golden plumage. If its gag is
removed, it repeatedly honks “Mother Rosy.” It is otherwise unable to speak.
Golden eggs: Every 1d4 days, it lays a golden egg worth
40gp that induces a subtle, covetous feeling in those
who see it. After 4d6 days, the egg collapses into dust.
History: The Golden Goose was once the prized possession of the fairy noble, the Hag Thorn-Rosy (p32),
until her servitor Crocus stole it and fled to the mortal
world. Thorn-Rosy bestows a significant reward upon
whomever returns it, just as she would severely punish
whomever keeps it from her.

The Phantom Lighthouse

0104

Unsteady islands of festering vegetation, amid a mire of black mud and iridescent pools.
Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Lighthouse in the Bog
Toward the north of the hex, a low, scrubby island 200
yards across rises out of the festering bog. A lonely tower
stands defiantly in the middle.
Beam at night: During the hours of darkness, a wide beam
of eerie, pale blue light shines out from the summit of
the tower, sweeping across the bog in slow, two-minute
revolutions.
Approaching: At 200 yards distance, the tower can be seen
in more detail: it is circular, four storeys tall, and made of
rough stone blocks. At the summit is a roofed area with a
thick metal railing.
Characters familiar with coastal regions: Recognise the
tower as a lighthouse.
Climbing onto the island: The sides are choked with
thorny, scabrous succulents at ankle height. On the
summit, the soil and scrubby undergrowth teem with
centipedes and ticks.
Entering the lighthouse: A portal gapes at the base of the
tower, the door having fallen and rotted long ago. There
are two square windows at each of the four levels, barred
with rusted iron.
Inside the lighthouse: The interior of the lighthouse
differs based on the time of day—see below.

Inside the Lighthouse—Daytime
The lighthouse’s interior is slick with black lichen but
otherwise utterly barren. The wind whistles eerily through
the barred windows and empty chambers.
The lantern room: Worn shards of the shattered lantern
litter the upper floor. Inside the wrecked frame, a faint
blackness and shimmering can be seen, as if a patch of
the starry night sky were trying to pierce through into the
day. Touching the blackness induces a feeling of nausea
and dread.

Inside the Lighthouse—Nighttime

The Dredger
A giant, 8-armed cephalopod, with milky, near transparent flesh, a sucker-like mouth, and a trio of pupilless, purple eyes. The Dredger feeds on the magic of the
Crystal of Sepulture at the lantern’s heart, disrupting the
crystal’s function and temporarily releasing figments
of the mariners’ souls trapped within.
Large Monstrosity—Animal Int.—Neutral

Level 7 AC 14 HP 45 Saves D8 R9 H10 B11 S12
Att 6 tentacles (+6, 1d4 + constriction) Speed 10
Swim 80 Morale 10 XP 1,380
Constriction: Tentacles grab and constrict after a hit,
inflicting 1d4 automatic damage per Round.
Severing tentacles: Requires a hit inflicting 6+ damage.

Pale blue, spectral mariners crowd around benches and
barrels in the lighthouse’s whitewashed chambers, raising mugs of ale in delirious toasts to “the Lord of the
Seas.” They do not perceive PCs, who are able to walk right
through them.
The lantern room: A spectral blue light beam blazes from a
1′ high, faceted, ovoid crystal positioned behind the lenses
of the lantern. The crystal rotates slowly. The slimy bulk
of an octopoid monstrosity—the Dredger—fills most of
the room, its tentacles wrapped around the lantern, the
light beam blazing visibly through its translucent flesh. It
attacks any who disturb it.
Removing the Dredger: If the Dredger is killed or removed
from the lantern room, the beam of light is extinguished
and the spectral mariners vanish from the lighthouse,
reabsorbed by the crystal at the lantern’s heart. The lantern
can be opened and the crystal accessed—it is a Crystal Of
Sepulture (p404).

Devour magic: If a spell is cast upon the Dredger, there
is a 3-in-6 chance of it having no effect, the magic being
instead sucked into the monster’s maw. Following such
magical sustenance, the Dredger regains 1d6 HP.

The Demesne of the Frore Gryphus

Long, blue-green grass mixed with wild coneflower and goldenrod. Unnatural silence fills the area.
Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 3-in-6 likely to
be with the frore gryphus residing in this hex, soaring
high above the grasslands in search of prey.

Frozen Battleground
No matter the season, wide, frost-covered patches of hard
earth dot the centre of this hex, ice cracking in web-like
patterns. The patches radiate magic and wintry cold.
Searching the field: Soon reveals the remnants of an
ancient battle: arrowheads marked with High Elfish frostrunes, broken blades of swords ranging from the crude to
the fanciful, and decayed pennants of forgotten heraldry.
The fallen giant: In a particularly desolate portion of the
battleground, a dead frost giant lies prone, limbs sprawled
wide, marbled blue eyes staring skyward. Alongside him,
two ice-coated soldiers, man and frost elf, stand frozen in
conflict, swords permanently crossed.
History: This field was the site of a major battle in the war
between humans and the armies of the Cold Prince (see
History, p14), nearly 900 years ago. The frost-magicks
unleashed by the fairy army linger here still.

Shepherd Encampment
At the southern edge of the hex stands a gentle hill dotted
with small tree groves, leaves green and yellow. Wandering the slopes are many sheep, with sleepy sheep dogs
pacing and watching for predators. The hill is crowned by a
rough semicircle of irregular boulders, and in their shadow
sits a cluster of rough canvas tents stained by weather,
surrounding a cooking fire.

Aegnyth Cormick—Shepherd Leader
A tall, broad-shouldered human woman with weathered olive brown skin and long black hair in a tight,
practical braid. Garbed in shepherd’s robes, fraying and
stained with weather.
Demeanour (Lawful): Sturdy and solemn, with a
magnetism that causes humans and sheep alike to feel
secure. Deeply pragmatic, an authority respected by
both sheep and shepherd.

Inhabitants: 12 shepherds focused on caring for their
flocks, squabbling over wool prices, and debating how to
protect their sheep from the winged beast that preys upon
them—a fairy creature, according to local legend, called a
frore gryphus. The shepherds’ unofficial leader is Aegnyth
Cormick.

Speech: Slow drawl, lovingly enunciating every syllable
and consonant. Woldish.

The Nest of the Frore Gryphus (Hidden)

The frore gryphi were beasts of war in the armies
of the Cold Prince. They resemble enormous, longnecked hawks (12′ tall), with razor-sharp, toothy grins,
wingspans of over 20′, and long talons springing from
stumpy legs. Their frost-coated, silver feathers shimmer with drapings of ice.

Scattered copses of trees dot the northern edge of the
hex. Concealed within one of them is an enormous nest
of broken boughs and uprooted shrubbery.
Inhabitants: Brood of 5 frost-rimed frore gryphlings (stats
as hawks, DMB) noisily peck at one another. There is 3-in-6
chance that their mother, the frore gryphus who terrorises
this hex, is in the nest; if not, she arrives in 1 Turn.
Searching the nest: Takes 1 Turn and reveals, wedged
amongst the crushed foliage, a Fairy Longsword (Mortal
Bane, p412) of frost elf origin, and a necklace of ice-like
crystals (650gp)—both leftover relics from the Frozen
Battlefield.
History: A survivor of the ancient battle, this frore gryphus
lay frozen for centuries and has only recently awoken and
laid her clutch of eggs.

194

Desires: News from Shrivelbyne (0108). Safety for her
flock. The defeat or banishment of the frore gryphus.

Cold iron: As fairies, frore gryphi suffer 1 extra point of
damage when hit with cold iron weapons.
Swoop: Can dive onto victims visible from above.
If the victim is surprised, the attack inflicts double
damage. On a natural Attack Roll of 18 or more, a Small
or Medium victim can be carried away.

The Outlook and the Red Monolith

0106

Spires and crags of pale, wind-carved rock, like the bones of gargantuan beasts.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Wayfarrow (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

Granite Crag
Close to the eastern edge of the hex, a sheer granite crag,
50′ wide at the base, smothered in ivy and brambles, rises
unexpectedly and penetrates the canopy of the wood. A
faint crimson glow is visible at the summit.
Searching the base: Searching the brambles at the base of
the crag reveals the remnants of ancient magical runes,
hinting at the astral significance of the place, as well as
several human skeletons. Many of the bones on the skeletons are broken.
Climbing: The crag is 100′ tall and steep-sided. Characters
with the ability to climb walls can scale it without danger.
Others must make a Dexterity Check to climb unaided.
Summit: The crag tapers to a 30′ wide summit. A 20′-high
spectral monolith of crimson light hovers at the centre.
(See The Red Vorpal Monolith.)
Panoramic views: The summit affords a panoramic view
of the surrounding land, as far as the Falls of Naon to the
north-east, on a clear day.

The Red Vorpal Monolith
Hovering at the top of the granite crag is a 20′-high spectral
monolith of crimson light. This is one of the mysterious
vorpal monoliths that trace an emergent fifth ley line in
Dolmenwood (see Vorpal Monoliths, p19). In spring,
summer, and autumn, the monolith is a mere shimmering
figment. In wintertime, it becomes semi-corporeal.
Viewing: All who behold the monolith in the wintertime
must Save Versus Spell. Arcane spell-casters gain a +2
bonus. Those who fail are overcome by a wave of terror
and the desire to leave the monolith’s presence as quickly
as possible. Climbing down in this state of dread requires a
Climb Walls Check or a Dexterity Check with a –2 penalty.
Touching: In its wintertime manifestation, the monolith’s
partially tangible surface feels like cold, sticky slime. Spells
of shadow or darkness cast while touching the monolith
are made permanent. In other seasons, a PC touching the
monolith’s diaphanous outline temporarily experiences
the frosty chill of a winter’s day.

195

0107

The Weeping Woman
Faint, otherworldly pipe music drifts sporadically on the breeze.

Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Wolfsbane (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

The Weeping Woman
Near the verge of the forest stands a tall outcropping of
lichen-pocked grey stone surrounded by boulders and
scattered rubble. The 40′-tall central outcropping—while
clearly a natural rock formation—resembles a cloaked
female figure, kneeling and facing westward. The figure is
known to locals as the Weeping Woman.
The Woman’s tears: From dark recesses in the figure’s face
trickle twin rivulets of cold water that roll down her body
and form a stream beneath her. This stream flows north,
through part of Dolmenwood, eventually spilling into the
dank fens of the Northern Scratch.
Drinking the waters: The water is deliciously cold and
refreshing, with a faint blossomy note. Those who imbibe
must Save Versus Spell or begin to perceive faint, piping
music of a singularly enchanting nature. The source of the
music is unclear, but it seems to drift from the Woman’s
eyes, along with the water, emanating from an aquifer deep
below the world.
Hearing the music: Those who hear the music of the deeps
fall into an enchanted reverie wherein they are compelled
to dance and caper at the feet of the Weeping Woman.
Dancers perceive elves, fauns, sylphs, and nymphs emerging from the forest to join them in celebration of starlight
and moonlight. (Those not affected by the water and the
music cannot see these creatures—indeed, they may be
purely imaginary, at the Referee’s discretion.) They dance
into the night and until dawn, when the music fades.

196

After the music: When dawn comes, dancers fall into a
slumber at the feet of the Weeping Woman and sleep for
8 hours, magically protected from the elements. If undisturbed, they heal 1d6 Hit Points.
Long-term effects of the music: All who have danced to
the enchanting music dream sporadically, over the next 6
months, of odd, sly-faced elves demanding they “return the
music stolen from the fairy lord of Neveryon.” (Neveryon is
not counted among the fairy realms known to those who
study such matters.)

The Cabbage Plot

0108

Field after field of turnip, leek, radish, and rye. A hint of rotting cabbage drifts on the breeze.
Terrain: Farmland (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 1-in-6 likely to
be with a gang of Murkin’s Soldiers.

Hamlets and Rotting Cabbages
A patchwork of fields, country lanes, farms, and little clusters of dwellings crowds this hex in the domain of the cruel
Lord Murkin (p65).
Rotting cabbages: Blackened, rotting cabbages with an
unusual crown-like shape notably fill a number of fields
bordering the West Road.
Investigating the cabbages: Natives of the High Wold
recognise these as “crown cabbages,” a highly prized
export of the region, especially beloved by Duke Brackenwold (p58). If PCs linger, there is a 2-in-6 chance of
a gang of Murkin’s Soldiers arriving to harass them on
suspicion of destroying the valuable crops.
Source of the rot: In truth, the cabbages have been secretly
poisoned by locals rebelling against Murkin’s tyranny. See
The Cabbage Plot.

The Crimson Bath (Inn)
Two miles from the gates of Kolstoke Keep (0208), the West
Road passes through a cluster of dwellings and outbuildings known as the hamlet of Shrivelbyne. At the centre of
the hamlet is a tall, wonky inn.
Sign: A portly longhorn gentleman relaxing in a bath of red
wine. The gentleman depicted is the previous Lord Murkin
(the current Lord Murkin’s father).
Common room: A poky, smoke-filled room lit only by the
grate opposite the entrance. Miniature portraits of bears
dressed as nobility dot the walls. Timilda Brumble and
her husband Grerg—a human from Dreg—serve from a
tree-trunk bar. An acrid reek occasionally wafts up from
the cellar, when the door is opened.
Guests: Rowdy farmhands, a mix of humans and shorthorns. The mood veers between tomfoolery, raucous jigs,
conspiratorial whispering, and drunken screeds against
Murkin.
Soldiers: A gang of Murkin’s Soldiers drops by to harass the
inn’s patrons most evenings.
The cellar: Concealed behind a stack of barrels is a vat of
acrid, black liquid—a vegetable poison brewed by Timilda
for use in the Cabbage Plot.

Services at the Crimson Bath
Lodgings and food: Of poor quality (DPB). Bedrooms
lean noticeably and creak disconcertingly.
Poodden pie: Timilda’s speciality: a pie of blackberries,
apple, and custard. Significantly surpasses the quality
of all other food available here. 2sp a serving.

The Cabbage Plot
The common folk of this area, angered by Lord Murkin’s petty laws and crippling taxes, are on the verge of
revolt. Timilda Brumble has led a secret plot to destroy
this year’s harvest of crown cabbages, in an attempt to
draw the duke’s attention to Lord Murkin’s tyranny.

Murkin’s Soldiers
Unruly gangs of soldiers in the employ of Lord Murkin
roam this hex. Each gang is composed of 1d4 humans
(Level 1 fighters—DMB) and 1d4 shorthorns (DMB). The
gangs are tasked with the following:
Recruitment: Press-gang working class youths of
disrepute (e.g. vagrants, layabouts, adventurers) into
service in Murkin’s army. They use force if they clearly
outmatch their targets. Any successfully recruited are
taken to the camp in hex 0109.
Rooting out rebels: Capture those responsible for the
Cabbage Plot.

Timilda Brumble—Crimson Bath Proprietor
An elderly shorthorn woman with tan fur, a silver nose,
and missing front teeth. Dresses in layers of woollen shawls and skirts. A respected community elder,
Timilda is also the secret leader of the plots against
Lord Murkin.
Demeanour (Lawful): Mild-mannered, sweetly smiles.
Shrewd, scheming.
Speech: Slow, rustic lilt. Woldish, Gaffe.
Desires: The dethronement of Lord Murkin, preferably to be replaced by his cousin Lady Borrid (0109). To
keep the plots against Murkin from deteriorating into
violence.

197

0109

Lady Borrid and Murkin’s Army
Ancient coppices of hazel and chestnut. North-south paths are trampled with bootprints.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Lady Borrid’s Hunting Lodge
Among the thickets of blackthorn in the north of the hex
is a small, high-gabled brick manor, replete with pointed
turrets and balconies surveying the woods.
Inhabitants: Lady Borrid, her animal companion
Brynne—a white-furred giant weasel (DMB—unfailingly
loyal to Lady Borrid, does not check Morale), and 1d6 hunting companions (Level 1 hunters—DMB).
Visitors: Lady Borrid enjoys her peace, but may host travellers bearing news on High Wold politics or fearsome
monsters.
Making ready for the hunt: Borrid and her companions
are preparing to venture north to hunt down the cheese
monstrosity rumoured to lair in central Dwelmfurgh (see
hex 0405). Friendly PCs may be invited to join the hunt.
Entrance hall: An unlocked front door engraved with
hunting motifs leads to a wood-panelled hall, at the far
end of which hangs a mighty moose head. Entering without permission causes the moose head to bellow, alerting
all within to the intrusion.
Feasting hall: With plush, ivy-carved wooden furnishings
and decked with the taxidermied heads, horns, and antlers
of a multitude of fearsome beasts, including a manticore’s
head, an antler wraith’s antlers, and a 5′ wide wyrm’s skull
with the inscription “The Wyrm of Odd.” A Horn of Blasting
(p408, crafted from the horn of a devil goat—DMB) is
concealed among the trophies.
Upper floor: Bedroom suites furnished in a luxurious but
modest style.
Secret chamber: A secret door in the cellars leads to a vault
containing chalices and jewels worth 8,000gp, a Fairy
Shortbow (p412) carved from a giant antler, and a quiver
of 12 Fairy Arrows (Breggle Bane, p412).

Murkin’s Army
In a secluded dell in the south of the hex, a mile into the
woods, can be found a ring of canvas tents, sloppily camouflaged with sprays of bracken and oak. Clustered to one side
are tables, log stools, barrels of pickled turnips and eggs,
and racks of hanging squirrels and rabbits.
Inhabitants: 18 shorthorns (DMB) and 22 humans (Level
1 fighters—DMB) under the command of the longhorn
Sergeant Snidebleat. The troops’ morale is low, many of
them having been press-ganged into service.
Activities: Mustering for war against House Nodlock (see
Human Nobility, p56). For now, this consists mainly of
pike training, marching in formation, and furtive swilling
of ale. A pot of stew is constantly steaming.
Visitors: Are brought before Snidebleat for questioning,
then brusquely told to move along.

Lady Amonie Borrid (Level 9 Hunter)
A limber human woman in her 50s, with arched brows,
chestnut eyes, and a blonde braid down her back.
Dresses in a green woollen tunic and brown leather
breeches. While she spent her youth roaming the deep
woods, avoiding political matters, Borrid now follows
the manoeuvrings of the High Wold noble houses with
concern. She is famed throughout Dolmenwood for
having slain a mighty blood wyrm that terrorised Odd.
Demeanour (Lawful): Quiet vigilance, broken with
gentle laughter.
Speech: Precise, considered. Woldish, Gaffe.
Desires: To turn back the tides of war in the High Wold.
Views Lord Ramius (p65) as potential peacemaker.
Possessions: A cloak of autumnal leaves (grants +2 AC).
A Bag of Holding (p420) containing 2,000gp.
Family: Maternal cousin of Lord Murkin (p65).

198

Sergeant Crewwin Snidebleat (Level 4 Knight)
A longhorn woman with russet fur, amber eyes, and
2′-long, outward curving horns. Dresses in burnished
plate mail with a full visor helm. Snidebleat is a member
of Lord Murkin’s (p65) knightly retinue, the Horns
of Kolstoke. Her loyalty is bought—she loathes Murkin
and his pompous schemes.
Demeanour (Neutral): Air of refinement, enjoys humiliating her lessers.
Speech: Eloquent, husky. Woldish, Caprice, Gaffe.
Desires: To see Murkin ridiculed. Glory in easily-won
skirmishes. Ascent to a position of aristocracy and
wealth. Assistance in brokering a potential alliance
with Red Gwen (hex 0311) to accomplish said goals.
Possessions: A Ring of Energy Resistance (Fire, p410),
searing to the touch. A pouch of 20 onyxes (50gp each).

The Shadow of Lord Gnarlgruff

0110

Shadowy woods of holly and hawthorn. Life here is creeping and vigilant, as if avoiding some looming terror.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 1d3 devil goats (DMB).

Devil Goats’ Glade
An awful charnel stench permeates a large section of the
wood. Following it to its source leads to a shadowy glade
ringed with sighing, black-leafed poplars. At the centre of
the glade stands a blackened, roughly shaped monolith,
draped with rotting entrails, amid a mound of bones.
Inhabitants: 2d4 devil goats (DMB) mill about the glade,
devouring corpses among the pile of bones, rearing up to
drape fresh entrails over the monolith, and licking the gore
that streaks the stone’s surface.
Entering: The devil goats suffer none but longhorn breggles to enter the glade.
Examining the bones: Scattered among the remains of
shorthorns, humans, and forest animals can be found 15gp,
155sp, a silver dagger, a silver necklace with a single grey
ioun (250gp, p394), a gold ring with a red garnet engraved
with the letter E (400gp), and a hip flask containing a dose
of Philtre of Wondrous Vitality (p414).
Examining the monolith: Its crumbling surface is carved
with ancient Caprice script, now only partially legible. The
following intact fragments can be deciphered by any who
can read Caprice: “I bind my spirit to this stone” … “wander
restless through benighted realms” … “to manifest when
the full moon rises.”
History: The monolith is all that remains of the razed laboratory of Lord Gnarlgruff, an ancient longhorn necromancer and ancestor of Lords Malbleat (p64) and Ramius
(p65). A fragment of his spirit lingers still in this place
where he practiced dire sorcery.

Nights of the Full Moon
On nights of the full moon, the monolith is wreathed with
a flickering, violet aura and a faint, moaning voice can be
heard on the wind.
Listening: The voice rants in disjointed Caprice of an
ancient mode. Any who understand Caprice can pick out
the following snippets: “in time I shall return” … “the workings of Malbleat, scion of House Gnarlgruff” … “the Book
of Foul Wonders.”
Meaning: Lord Gnarlgruff seeks to live once more, hoping
that his descendant, Lord Malbleat, resurrects his remains
that lie beneath the Shadholme (0709). The Book of Foul
Wonders—an ancient, near-mythical tome of longhorn
necromancy (named “Ghrehraird frengl Llaindr” in
Caprice)—may contain the key. The book is believed to
have been stolen, following Gnarlgruff’s demise, by a rival
sorcerer to the east of Dolmenwood.

The Wishing Pit

Scrubby grassland dotted with fern-capped knolls. Old hedgerows and walls demarcate disused arable fields.
Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold.
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.

Roadside Signs and Trails
About four miles west of Nodding Castle (hex 0210), travellers along the West Road notice makeshift hand-painted
signs and carvings, with prominent arrows pointing southward along trails to the “Wishing Pit.”
Following the trails: The trails seem blazed by visitors’
feet, pack animal hooves, and wagon wheels. They end near
a low hill, topped by a ruin, a small encampment at its base.

Encampment
Rough tents and wagons circle small campfires. Encamped
here are 2d10+10 assorted pilgrims and merchants.
Charlatans: The party is immediately approached by obvious tricksters and crooks, selling fake Church tokens of
luck and protection costing 1d3sp each.
Rumours: Excited locals regale the party with accounts of
miracles granted by the pit atop the hill.
Searching: The area around the earthwork reveals wagon
tracks leading to and from the hill’s southern slope,
concealed by mud-coated rugs. Searching the thorny brush
here reveals the hidden entrance to the Smugglers’ Cave.

Wishing Pit Complex
Atop the hill is an ancient cobblestone parade ground hung
with Chapes holy symbol banners. Fallen walls coated in
moss lean on each other like standing stones around the
perimeter. At its centre stands a decaying, round tower of
rough hewn grey stone, its roof collapsed.
Inhabitants: Praephator Lenore and 8 shrine staff—they
appear to the PCs as clergy, but are in fact common thieves
(see The scam). The staff feign muteness.
Wishing Pit: At the east end of the parade ground is a trapdoor with crank lift system to lower items into the Wishing
Pit: a fire pit chamber below. Smoke scented with sage,
pine and incense issues from a large grate next to the pit.
Eager wishers arrive, each sacrificing an item to be burnt
to change their luck.
Stone megaphone: Visiting wishers are addressed by Praephator Lenore via a stone amplification sculpture shaped
like a megaphone, mounted near the pit.
Round tower: This small, single-story structure contains a
single drab chamber with a narrow staircase leading to the
crank room in the cave below. 3 shrine staff guard the stair.
To make a wish: One states their wish to Praephator Lenore
and offers an item of great personal or financial value.
The scam: The shrine staff pretend to burn the items in
sacrifice, but actually sell them to travelling merchants
and smugglers, with whom they have an accord.

200

Praephator Lenore—False Oracle
A tall human woman with waves of long black hair with
a shock of white at the temples. She dresses like a religious hermit with long, overly dramatic grey robes,
embroidered with silver Chapes holy symbols.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Elevated and mysterious, but
with a warm and welcoming tone. Otherworldly.
Speech: Imperious with elongated vowels. Woldish.
Desires: To successfully run this grift without drawing
authorities’ attention. She hopes the wishes come true.

Shrine Staff
Level 1 thieves (DMB) disguised in altar robes, affecting miens of exaggerated gravity and solemnity. They
pretend to have taken a vow of silence, but can be
provoked to break it by shock or opportunity.

The Smugglers’ Cave (Hidden)
The cave beneath the hill is accessible via the stairs from
the round tower to the crank room, or via a hidden entrance
concealed by thorny bushes in the southern slope.
Crank room: Contains an enormous smouldering fire pit,
the crank lift system from the parade ground, and carts to
transport the “sacrifices.”
Hidden entrance: Leads to a guard station, where a single
shrine staff member sleeps in a chair leaning against the
wall, a large keyring (includes key to storage room) at
his waist belt. Weapons hang neatly on hooks or stuck in
barrels. A large bell hangs on the wall—if rung, all staff and
Praephator Lenore arrive in 1d3 Rounds.
Storage room (locked): An assortment of belongings
of varying degrees of personal or commercial value on
sagging wooden shelves, worth 180gp altogether.

Grave of the Aubrathon and Helath Tor 0201
Rusty brown bog riddled with sluggish waterways. Clumps of raised, drier ground dotted with cairns.
Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Blushing Mandrake (p430), in addition to the normal
results.

The Grave of the Aubrathon
The gloomy monotony of a tract of tussocky heath is
interrupted by a 7′-tall obelisk of black stone, veined with
orange. This is a lonely memorial to the renegade archDrune known as the Aubrathon (see p55).
Drunic inscription: “Aubrathon—Mightiest of the sons
of Drune—Dissident heart, indomitable mind, adamant
spirit—Wherever thou tarriest may thy bones one day
honour the Lodge.”
Touching the stone: Causes 1d6 damage to Lawful and
Chaotic characters, and heals 1d3 HP to Neutral characters
(once a day per character).
History: The cenotaph was erected 500 years past, when
the controversial deeds of the Aubrathon were reappraised
by some within the Drune. The monument marks the site
of the Aubrathon’s final discourse with his acolyte Cylaeth,
before he strode north into the bog and vanished without
trace.

Helath Tor
A high, rocky hill composed of huge, leaning slabs of heather-patched granite stands in the far north of this hex. At its
base, a cave mouth can be spied.

Nanna Wortgrew—Harridan
A hulking, hunched ogress, 8′ tall, with pallid, violet
skin, sodden black hair, and bulging eyes of livid scarlet.
Dresses in rags of velvet and lace, and wears a crystal amulet. Formerly a servant of Atanuwë (p45),
she went into self-imposed exile upon being forcibly
changed to Lawful Alignment after mockingly donning
the amulet (a saintly relic—the Amulet of St Hamfast—
captured from slain Pluritine Church pilgrims).

Approaching: The boggy ground outside the cave mouth
is dotted with small cairns topped with animal skulls. A
foul, animalistic reek emanates from within.

Demeanour (Lawful): Tender, suspicious. Head and
limbs twitch involuntarily.

Interior: A dank cavern, clad with a tapestry of moulds
and slimy, black fungi. Water drips from the ceiling into a
brackish pool in which bundles of marsh vegetables pickle.
Piles of reeds serve as beds.

Desires: To remain hidden from Atanuwë and its
minions. To die human. (Has a vague recollection of
her former life, before being corrupted by Atanuwë.
A quest to a holy site could restore her human form.)

Inhabitants: The exiled harridan Nanna Wortgrew lives
here along with a domesticated menagerie of lame and
wounded bog animals—sheep, swamp sloths, merrimans,
crows, and woads. The animals are loyal to Wortgrew, who
nurses them to health. Animals who fail to recover are
lovingly interred in the skull-adorned cairns outside.
Visitors: Are expelled with feigned, exaggerated menace.
Those showing an allegiance with the Pluritine Church
may be cautiously welcomed.

Speech: Spluttering and drooling. Woldish, Gaffe.

Knowledge: The powers of Atanuwë. The location and
structure of the Court of the Nag-Lord (hex 0904), as
well as a secret way from the thorn wall directly into
the throne room.

The Amulet of St Hamfast
A 2″ crystal, engraved with a Chapes holy symbol and
set in a chunk of polished sandalwood. Worth 10,000gp.
Laying on hands: The wearer can heal 4 Hit Points per
day by laying their hands on wounded characters.
Speak with animals: The wearer can communicate
with normal animals of any species.
Alignment change: A non-Lawful character who dons
the amulet becomes Lawful and is cursed. The curse is
such that the wearer cannot remove the amulet, once
in place, and resists attempts to remove it. The curse
can be removed by magic or (at the Referee’s option) by
performing a special quest.

0202

Oath Isle

Countless pools, streams, and rivulets draining into the Upper Hameth. Moss-covered willows pervade.
Terrain: Swamp (4), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6

Oath Isle
A small isle—little more than a heaping of mossy stones,
100 yards across—sits amid the wide shallows of the Upper
Hameth as the river seeps through the swamp. A grove of
dark, broken-limbed pines clings to the isle, creaking in
the breeze.
Signs of habitation: A building of rough stone is visible
through the trees. See The Knight’s Abode.

The Knight’s Abode
A squat, skewed hut constructed of the same moss-covered
stones as the isle on which it stands. Appears to be a partial
ruin, shored up and made once more habitable by recent
work. A meagre smoke drifts from the chimney.
Inhabitants: The lost knight Sir Tegwyn the Disloyal lives
a forlorn existence in the rude hut.
Interior: A single, dingy room, 15′ square, with a bed of
reeds, tables and chairs of stacked river stones, and racks
of drying fish. Opposite the fireplace hang a gleaming suit
of armour and sword (see Sir Tegwyn’s possessions).
Visitors: Sir Tegwyn desperately welcomes any visitors to
his forsaken isle, offering them a humble meal of marsh
fish and reed tea.

Sir Tegwyn the Disloyal (Level 3 Knight)
A scrawny, once handsome human man with distant
grey eyes and raggedly trimmed silver beard and hair.
Appears to be in his late middle years. Dresses in the
threadbare remnants of once fine garb. Regular bathing in the Hameth keeps him clean, despite his rude
circumstances. Served in Fort Vulgar (hex 0604) 100
years ago, but is now cursed to remain on Oath Isle and
age but never die (see Curse).
Demeanour (Neutral): Noble bearing belies his ragged
appearance. Crazed, desperate look in his eyes.
Speech: Scattered, faltering. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: Longs for a magical means to escape Oath Isle.
Rewards: Would loyally serve any who could release
him from his curse (see Curse).
Possessions: A Holy Longsword (Undead Bane, p412),
inlaid with Old Woldish script: “Talleghon, bane of the
deathless.” (Tegwyn dwells on the strange fate of such
a weapon accompanying his own deathless existence.)
Curse: Tegwyn sought the Lady of Spring Unending
(hex 0402), wishing to behold her fabled beauty. The
fey Lady fell in love with the young knight, but cursed
him upon discovering his unfaithfulness with several
of her maids. Banished to Oath Isle and cursed with
immortality, he has dwelt alone here since, unable to
leave and unable to die. His curse can be ended only via
magic or by convincing the Lady to lift it.

202

The Shrine to St Sedge (Hidden)
The lost wayside shrine to St Sedge lies submerged in the
swamp in the far north of the hex, only the tiled ridge of
its roof still visible.
Statue of St Sedge: Austere stone, 3′ high, depicting St
Sedge dressed in knightly armour with a sword.
Prayer: If the shrine is extracted from the mud and
cleaned, characters praying may receive the blessing of St
Sedge: the ability to cast Bless Weapon. See Shrines, p22.

The Moss Garden

0203

A drear, pathless expanse of black pools, mud beds, and copses of rotting trees.
Terrain: Swamp (4), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with Brawg or Agnes.

The Moss Garden
In a particularly foetid corner of the bleak mire, the stink of
decaying corpses mingles with the peaty reek of bog moss.
Cadavers—their heads crushed, bellies clawed open, and
spines broken—bob like macabre buoys in the black water,
festooned with sickeningly vivid green moss.
Owners: The moss garden is owned by trolls (DMB) Brawg
and Agnes, who prize the succulent moss they diligently
nurture on the corpses of their victims. Adventurers have
a 3-in-6 chance of encountering one of the trolls in the
garden. Should this happen, there is an additional 3-in-6
chance that the other appears and contests their right to
the PCs, leading to a surreal argument over who can kill
the travellers and cultivate moss on their bodies.
Marital dispute: Brawg and Agnes used to be a mated pair,
but recently they have been squabbling and divided their
moss farm between the two of them. The trolls bicker
endlessly over where the border of one troll-spouse’s territory ends and the other begins.

Troll-Hole (Hidden)
The two trolls share a lair near the middle of the swamp,
a dank grotto accessible via a narrow, flooded passage.
This can only be found through extensive searching or by
following one of the trolls.
Interior: Slick, slimy walls and floor. Like everything else,
the cave is ruthlessly divided by the former troll-mates.
Brawg’s side: A pile of broken wooden furniture, a filthy
mat of swamp grass, and a wooden cage containing three
well-fed, meticulously-groomed songbirds.
Agnes’s side: A clean grass mat and a neatly ordered collection of steel carving implements.
Treasure: On both sides of the cave are identical crude
wooden boxes, each containing half of the following: four
portions of Snogglebeard (p430), 20,000sp, 5,000gp, two
bloodstones (50gp each), and two beryls (500gp each).

Brawg—Troll
A pot-bellied troll, covered in warts and boils, with the
greasy remains of a once-resplendent mane of hair
matted about his bald head.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Lazy, self-indulgent, lecherous.
Curiously gentle with small animals.
Speech: Grumpy, peevish. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: Brawg desperately wishes to be reunited with
his former mate, Agnes, but he is stubborn and unwilling to admit his faults, too proud to apologise. If he can
be coaxed into meeting Agnes’s demands and apologizing for his behaviour, the two trolls might reconcile.
However, he insists that Agnes make the first move.

Agnes—Troll
A thin, long-limbed troll with enormous yellow eyes
and long, dark hair who delights in swimming through
the wetlands and ambushing potential victims, making
them fodder for the moss-farm.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Fastidious, irritable, judgemental. Fond of flowers.
Speech: Sharp-tongued, clever. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: Agnes has a long list of complaints against
Brawg. She wishes he would help clean the troll-hole,
assist in his share of moss-harvesting, stop squeezing his boils in their lair, and bring her swamp-flowers
the way he used to. She has grudging affection for her
former mate but finds his indolence and inattentiveness off-putting.

0204

The Summerstone Uruzzur

Squelching mud punctuated with clumps of purple-leafed reeds and granite spires and boulders.
Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Mud Basin
Close to the centre of the hex, the boggy ground dips and
forms a 100-yard-wide, sludge-bottomed basin, 10′ deep
at its centre. At the very centre of the basin, raised upon
an 11′-high column of white marble, is a 15′-high shard of
basalt—the Summerstone Uruzzur.
Balmy stillness: The stone is surrounded by a 120-yard
radius of hazy warmth and balmy stillness of the air, reminiscent of the intoxicating days of high summer.
Invisible water: Though the basin appears empty, it is
in fact filled with magically invisible water secreted by
the Summerstone. Anyone entering experiences the odd
sensation of splashing, wetness, and water pressure, without any visual sign of the liquid.
Skeletons: At the base of the column (submerged in the
invisible water) lie four human skeletons, some armoured,
reaching towards the column as if desperately trying to
climb it.
Swimming: Alerts the stone-ward—the Audrune Mestmord—to the presence of intruders. Unless they come on
Drune business, the Audrune summons the 3 frost fiends
guarding the invisible waters.

Frost Fiends
Evil spirits of frost bound by Drune magic to protect
the pool around Uruzzur. Though the water of the pool
from which they form is invisible, the frost fiends are
visible as jagged, serpent-like extrusions of ice with
malevolent human faces.
Medium Monstrosity—Semi-Intelligent—Chaotic

Level 3 AC 15 HP 3d8 (13) Saves D11 R12 H13 B14 S15
Att Strike (+2, grab) Speed 40 Morale 9 XP 90
Formation: Take 2 Rounds to form.

Searching the skeletons: Adventurers able to swim to the
bottom of the pool and search the skeletons find an iridescent black suit of Fairy Chainmail (p400), a silver, winged
Helm of Realignment (p406), a quiver of 10 crystal-tipped
Arcane Arrows (p412), and 350gp.

Grab: The victim must Save Versus Hold or be dragged
underwater. Each Round in this state, they suffer 1d4
damage and must Save Versus Doom or become unconscious. Unless the frost fiend is killed, an unconscious
victim dies after 3 Rounds.

The Summerstone Uruzzur

Immunities: Only suffer 1 point of damage from sharp
weapons.

The Summerstone Uruzzur, also known as the Wetstone,
is a ragged shard of basalt (15′ high, 8′ around). The column
upon which it rests keeps it 1′ above the basin’s invisible
waterline. (See The Ring of Chell, p20 for full information on the Summerstones.)
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Water Breathing. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18
for details on learning this spell.
Touching: Anyone who touches the stone gains the ability
to breathe water and a +4 bonus to Saving Throws against
fire. Both effects last for 1d3 days.

Vulnerabilities: Double damage from fire attacks.
Return from death: If killed (0 HP), they reform with
full HP in 2 Rounds. Can only be killed permanently by
holy magic (e.g. Holy Fire, Purify Food and Drink).
Water-bound: Must remain in water.

The Audrune Mestmord
Incorporeal: Mestmord has abandoned his physical
form and now exists solely within the flow of the ley
energies around the stone Uruzzur. His body lies in
temporal stasis, ritually interred in the crypts of the
Drune Lodge (hex 0507).
Powers: Mestmord cannot interact with the physical
world directly, but can send word of intruders to the
Drune Aegis and can summon the frost fiends in the
invisible pool around Uruzzur against intruders.

204

Wooden Figures

0205

Quiet grasslands sparsely populated by leafless trees. Songbirds flit through the air.
Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

The Woodcarver’s House
In the south-east corner of the hex, nestled in the eaves
of Dolmenwood, is a picturesque wooden cottage with a
thatched roof. Its front door hangs off its hinges.
Inhabitants: The woodcarver Ellery Lumley and her 7
magical doll children. Six of the dolls are now slain (see
Workshop). The seventh, Minch, now keeps Ellery prisoner
(see Under the House).
Recent bandit attack: Several days ago, bandits attacked
the cottage, destroying the dolls and injuring Ellery. Minch
slew the bandits, but became mentally unhinged, traumatised by the concept of death.
Interior: A large room in disarray, its quaint furnishings
rummaged through and torn apart. A large, ornate wooden
doll’s house lies in pieces on the floor. An open door leads
to the Workshop.
Workshop: Filled with quality woodcarving tools (150gp),
staring wooden dolls, and carved statuettes. Six broken
dolls—two boys, two girls, a horse, and a dog—have been
carefully placed atop a workbench. These are the magical
doll children killed by the bandits. An open trapdoor leads
Under the House.
Backyard: Atop a mound of firewood are four decomposing naked corpses of human men—the bandits bludgeoned
to death by Minch. Four sets of bloody clothing, as well as
four shortswords, are neatly arranged beside the pile.

Minch—Animated Puppet
A 6′ tall wooden puppet, created by Ellery, carved in
the shape of a young man. The mouth on his rounded,
innocent face moves when he speaks, but his painted-on eyes do not. He wears a simple outfit sewn from
red and green bed sheets. If the PCs attempt to reason
with him, he willingly explains his motivations.
Demeanour (Neutral): Normally merry and jocular,
now distressed and angry. Naïve, he sometimes makes
strange leaps of logic.
Speech: Halting, childish. Woldish.
Desires: To avenge his dead siblings. To punish Ellery
for making him and his defenceless siblings (he now
believes it cruel to create new life). To rob the oak of its
life-giving magic. He hopes that starving Ellery to death
beside the tree achieves this, but he does not actually
know if this will work and keeps giving Ellery water.
Combat stats: As manikin (DMB), with 15 HP.

Under the House
The trapdoor ladder in the workshop descends into a dirt
corridor. This passageway slopes downward until reaching
a 30′ wide, 20′ tall underground cavern.
The oak: Dominating the cavern is an enormous, ancient
oak, its branches brushing the stone ceiling, its acorns
glowing with a faint silvery light.
The prisoner: Lashed to the tree is the dishevelled, barely
conscious Ellery Lumley. She is starving and delirious.
The puppet: Slumped in a rocky recess is a life-sized
wooden puppet: Lumley’s creation, Minch. He at first
seems absolutely motionless, but sporadically explodes
into uncontrollable sobbing.
Damaging the tree: If cut, the tree immediately heals,
growing back lost branches.
Life-giving wood: If wood from the tree is fashioned into
the form of a living creature, it becomes an animate being,
with a nature determined by the carver. This is how Minch
was created.

Ellery Lumley—Woodcarver
A large, comely human woman in her late 30s. Thick
red hair cascades down her back. Dressed in humble
clothes and a smock, she sports a black eye and broken
arm. A skilled woodcarver, she sought out the oak after
reading stories of its life-giving powers. She has so far
made Minch and the six now-destroyed dolls in the
workshop.
Demeanour (Neutral): Motherly, quick to obsess.
Speech: Soft, breathy. Woldish, basic Sylvan.
Desires: To master the secrets of the ancient oak. For
Minch to come to terms with death and release her.

Maidenhead Priory

Decrepit woodland, the ground littered with fallen trees and rotting branches. Many insects creep and tickle.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Maidenhead Priory
Just under the eaves of the wood at the northern border
of the hex lies the crumbling ruin of a small priory. The
place is known to locals as Maidenhead Priory, owing to
the great feminine bust half-buried near its entrance (the
remnant of a larger statue of St Gretchen). From a distance,
the structure appears to pulse and undulate, as if alive.
History: The priory was established here in an ultimately
vain attempt to bring piety and civilisation to the wretched
fens of Northern Scratch. With the rise of Atanuwë (see
History, p14), the priory was wracked by hauntings and
was abandoned 80 years ago.

Blanket of Beetles
Coming closer, it becomes clear that the creeping movement comes from the twitching blanket of black beetles
that envelops the crumbling walls.
Painful shrilling: If PCs approach or enter the priory, the
insects begin a terrible, incessant shrilling that inflicts 1
HP damage per Turn spent in the ruins.

The Banner of St Lillibeth
A beautifully woven tapestry, embroidered with six
doves (the doves of Saint Lillibeth). Worth 30,000gp.
Healing properties: Six times per day (once per dove),
a Lawful character can touch one of the doves to
recover 1d6+1 HP, but only if it is hung, unfurled, on
holy ground.

Repelling the beetles: Fire, smoke, and other noxious
fumes cause the beetles to retreat, but they return as soon
as the irritant is no longer present.

Within the Ruins
The crumbling stone innards of the priory are bare save for
the intrusions of nature—an endless carpet of moss blankets the walls and drifts of dead leaves carpet the floors.
Stairway: A debris-strewn stairway leads down to the
Defiled Crypt.
Hidden tapestry: Concealed behind a cascade of moss
hangs the magnificent Banner of St Lillibeth, magically
preserved. It is very difficult to find without knowing its
location (see Sealing the coffin).

Defiled Crypt
A low-ceilinged chamber, crawling with screeching beetles.
At the centre of the chamber lies a stained marble coffin,
its lid broken in half.
Approaching the coffin: The stridulation of the beetles
takes on an almost mournful tone.
Examining the coffin: Liturgic text around the rim reads
“Here lies Jerome Gust, blessed prior and founder, humble
servant of the One True God.” The inside is bare; the prior’s
bones and vestments were stolen long ago.

206

Restless spirit: The prior’s restless spirit lingers, invisible,
in the crypt, its torment drawing the beetles to the priory.
Sealing the coffin: If the lid’s two fragments are placed
together to seal the coffin, they emanate a soft glow of
light as they fuse, and the beetles depart the priory in quiet
droves. Holy spell-casters are filled with an overwhelming
sense of awe and inspiration and receive a vision revealing
the location of the Banner of St Lillibeth, upstairs.

The Summerstone Radhd

0207

A dense, shadow-oppressed maze of trees. The air is utterly still and coagulates with the gloom.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

The Shadowed Bower
The woods around the Summerstone Radhd are under a
Drune enchantment that causes light to dwindle and falter.
Heavy, sluggish air: Breathing here is laboured and sound
is muted.
Darkness: As characters journey deeper into the hex, a
dusk-like darkness settles in. Without a light source or dark
sight, the gloom incurs a –1 penalty to Attack Rolls.
Flames: Subdued and sputtering. The radius of light cast
by lanterns and torches is reduced by 50%.
Shades: Characters perceive spectral forms, as if of hooded
men, observing them disapprovingly. The forms are illusory and disappear if attacked. These apparitions are a
manifestation of the presence of the Audrune Grebglin,
who wards the nodal Radhd.

The Summerstone Radhd (Hidden)

The Audrune Grebglin
Incorporeal: Grebglin has abandoned his physical form
and now exists solely within the flow of the ley energies around the stone Radhd. His body lies in temporal
stasis, ritually interred in the crypts of the Drune Lodge
(hex 0507).

The Summerstone Radhd, also known as the Stone of Law,
is a ragged shard of basalt (15′ high, 8′ around) lost in a pathless tangle of hawthorn. (See The Ring of Chell, p20 for
full information on the Summerstones.)

Powers: Grebglin cannot interact with the physical
world directly, but can send word of intruders to the
Drune Aegis and can summon 3 werephasms to attack
any who approach the Stone of Law.

Balmy stillness: The stone is surrounded by a 120-yard
radius of hazy warmth and balmy stillness of the air, reminiscent of the intoxicating days of high summer.

Werephasms

Approaching: Within 60 yards triggers the protective
wrath of the Audrune Grebglin, the stone-ward. 3 werephasms are conjured into existence to stalk those who
dare come near to the Stone of Law.
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Geas. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18 for details
on learning this spell.
Touching: While touching the stone, lies can be detected
without fail and oaths that are sworn are enforced via a
Geas (per the arcane spell).

Humanoid, lupine creatures of twisting shadow,
summoned by Drune magic. They snuff out light and
rend sentient beings’ souls from their flesh.

Howl: The bone-chilling howl has a 4-in-6 chance of
extinguishing light sources within 90′ (roll per light
source). This includes magical light, but excludes
permanent enchantments such as Holy Light.
Soul-rend: Each hit reduces the target’s Charisma by 1.
A target reduced to 0 Charisma dies and has their soul
abducted. Abducted souls are trapped as green vapour
in glass urns in the crypts of Drune Lodge (hex 0507).
Recovering lost Charisma: 1 point per day.

Kolstoke Keep and Illpuke Barrows
Rugged woods dotted with sodden ditches and ant-mounds. A low thrumming pervades.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Kolstoke Keep
Within a clear area, surrounded by looming forest on three
sides, stands the blocky, dark stone keep of Lord Murkin
(p65): Kolstoke Keep.
Ditch, wall, and motte: The keep is perched awkwardly
atop a giddying motte of earth and encircled with a crenelated stone wall. At the base of the wall is a ditch lined
with sharp spikes.
Gate: A wide drawbridge may be lowered over the ditch,
leading to a single, intimidating gatehouse that pierces
the wall.
Interior: Austere and militaristic. Cold stone halls are lined
with maps, banners, and antique weapons. The sound of
marching feet echoes throughout.
Inhabitants: The keep is the home of Lord Murkin (p65)
and his retinue of 12 longhorn knights, “the Horns of
Kolstoke” (use longhorn breggle stats—DMB). A troop of
20 soldiers (Level 1 fighters—DMB, a mix of shorthorns
and humans) acts as guards and household servants.
Visitors: Are unwelcome, though Lord Murkin may grant
an audience to those bearing gifts or sharing secrets beneficial in his campaigns against the other lords of the High
Wold (in particular Lord Harald Nodlock, p61).
Dungeons: Lady Mirilda Murkin (Murkin’s mother), a
human woman now in her seventies, is imprisoned in the
keep’s dungeons, after contradicting her son’s word one
too many times.

The Domain of Lord Murkin
The rule of House Murkin extends several leagues to the
west and north, encompassing a rambling collection of
hamlets and farmsteads (see Longhorn Nobility, p62).
Both humans and breggles live in this domain.
Revolt is brewing: Tired and angered by their Lord’s petty
laws and taxes, Murkin’s subjects grow belligerent. Revolt
is close at hand.

Illpuke Barrows
A few miles inside the dense canopy of the wood, south
of the keep, are a series of mounds known to the locals
as Illpuke Barrows. There are thirteen mounds in total: a
circle of twelve with one at the centre.
Capstones: Each mound is topped with a smooth round
stone, 20′ in diameter. The stones are covered in mosses,
lichens, and rampant vines.
Thrumming: The thrumming sound that permeates this
hex emanates from the mounds.
A queasiness of stomach: Stepping inside the circle of
mounds, one feels a faint queasiness, becoming stronger
the longer one remains.
Beneath the capstones: A jumble of humanoid bones is
buried, carved with magical script (runes of divination and
balancing). Examination reveals that the bones are elfish.
True purpose: The mounds are not actually barrows, but
were built for the sole purpose of supporting the curious
stones, which radiate a faint magical signal. Together, these
stones form an ancient device used to measure power and
deviations in the Witching Ring. This purpose and the
operation of the device are long-forgotten, though the
Drune know of the place and wish to reclaim it.

208

The Lethean Well

0209

Tree trunks and boughs twist, sway, and writhe, creating weirdly silhouetted forms.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Woodpurse (p430), in addition to the normal results.

The Grasping Corridor
A trail branches off of the High Road in hex 0208 to the
north of here; crossing into this hex, it soon becomes a
long, tree-lined, bough-vaulted path that travels gently
uphill. Inhabitants of this region call the path the Grasping
Corridor, and it is known to be the sole route to the Lethean
Well, a fabled lake in the hills.
Perpetual dark: Beneath the dense canopy, it is like night,
even during the brightest hours of daylight.
Drifting mist: A thin, pale mist drifts in the brooding
blackness of the woods on either side of the trail.
Grasping hands: Anyone getting too close to the inky darkness of the forest beyond the trail is grasped by cold, pale
hands that form out of the mist. They must Save Versus
Spell or vanish into the blackness of the woods, reappearing back on the trail 1d6 hours later, stripped of valuables
they carried and with no memory of where they have been.
Effects of flame: If any open flame is brought into the corridor, the things among the trees begin to shriek and wail
in increasing and maddening volume unless it is extinguished. Characters who persist in carrying fire here for
more than 1 Turn must Save Versus Hold or lose 1d3 points
of Wisdom. (Lost Wisdom is recovered after a week.)

Lake Enchantments (d6)
Bathing in the Lethean Well cures a magical disease or
curse, as well as causing one of the following effects:

d6 Enchantment

The Lethean Well

3

The lake known as the Lethean Well sits nestled in a hilly
region, surrounded by treacherous 60′ crags and pitchdark woods. It is nearly two miles across, and its banks
are overgrown and lined with dreamy weeping willows
in abundance.

4
5
6

Reaching the lake: For those who do not wish to scale the
rock faces, the lake is reachable only via the Grasping Corridor, which opens outwards at its terminus on the lake’s
northern shore.
Boggin clan: A malign clan of 12 boggins (DMB) inhabits
the lake. Should characters bathe in the lake (see below),
there is a 3-in-6 chance of 1d3 of the boggins attacking
them, attempting to drag them to their lair below.
Trading with the boggins: PCs who remain on the lakeshore for at least an hour attract the attention of 1d3
boggins, who swim to the water’s edge to converse. In
return for gems or jewellery (20gp value or greater) or
magic items, they allow characters to bathe in peace. They
may also trade for such items with a dose of the psychedelic
compound Lethe (p426), which they extract from the
brains of their victims.
Bathing: Entering the dark, slumbrous waters, one feels
a slowly pulsing vibration. Bathing in the lake for more
than an hour cures a magical disease or curse and places
an enchantment upon the bather (see Lake Enchantments).

Brain becomes increasingly sharp, permanently
increasing Intelligence by 1.
Gain a sense of serenity and contentment, permanently increasing Wisdom by 1.
Visage becomes radiant and beautiful, permanently
increasing Charisma by 1.
Become convinced they are half-pig.
Insatiable hunger for raw root vegetables.
Believe they are one of the Lords of the High Wold.

Each character can only be affected by the enchanted
waters once per year.

The Lethean Door (Hidden)
High in the rocky peaks that surround the lake is a 10′ tall
craggy portal of utter blackness that even magic cannot
illuminate. Adventurers with an invitation from Duke
Mai-Fleur may step into the portal and be transported to
the wild forests of Diuthurnia (p30). Without an invitation, the door is impassable.

Journeys Into Fairy (Optional)
Referees wishing to expand play into the realm of
Diuthurnia may allow adventurers to enter the Lethean
Door without an invitation. This requires the Referee to
develop adventure locales of their own in Diuthurnia.

Nodding Castle
Gloomy, dripping copses, drenched in cool mist and an unending drizzle.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.

Nodding Castle
The decaying Nodding Castle, ancestral home of Lord
Nodlock (p61), stands upon a hill at the forest’s edge.
The castle is built of grey stone, with three crumbling
towers. The walls drip with damp and mould.
Defensive palisade: A series of thorny trees grown and
woven into a latticework palisade rings the castle. The thick
palisade gates are decorated with horn and sport the heraldic shield of Lord Nodlock when the gates are closed. They
are manned by a surly and listless group of 8 guards (Level
1 fighters—DMB).
Moat of the dead: The castle itself is further surrounded
by a moat which is home to 7 bog corpses (DMB), headless
and perpetually attempting to claw their way up the steep,
slippery sides, then slumping back into the putrid water.
Lord Nodlock has pushed a deceitful advisor into the moat
on a number of occasions.
Interior: A haphazard procession of cluttered hallways,
disorderly studies, debauched feasting halls, and slovenly
boudoirs. Lord Nodlock’s long-suffering domestic staff
periodically scurry through, attempting to restore order
after their liege’s bouts of excess.
Barracks: A poorly trained garrison of 28 soldiers (Level
1 fighters—DMB) is quartered in decaying barracks at the
castle’s rear.
Inhabitants: Lord Nodlock resides here, attended by a retinue of advisors who oversee the castle and borders during
their Lord’s alcohol-induced slumbers (of which there are
many). A frequent attendant to Nodlock’s binges is his wine
taster, a wronguncle (DMB) called Tasper.
Visitors: The guest suites at Nodding Castle are seldom
vacant. Lord Nodlock welcomes visitors of noble stock,
hedonistic bent, or martial prowess, in addition to hordes
of jugglers, dancers, musicians, and fortune tellers. Those
who are not welcome can easily gain entrance posing as
entertainers or servants.

210

Tasper Crymehump—Wronguncle Wine Taster
A red-capped, 5′-tall humanoid mushroom that grew on
the corpse of Lord Nodlock’s former wine taster, who
was lost in the forest a year ago. Upon wandering to the
castle, the mushroom was welcomed back into the role
of wine taster, possessing all the skill and memories of
its deceased progenitor. The castle’s inhabitants regard
it with curiosity and affection.
Demeanour (Neutral): Genial and lighthearted.
Becomes murderous and conspiratorial at any mention
of the castle’s cook (see Desires).
Speech: Merry, squeaking banter. Woldish.
Desires: To locate and murder its loved one, Grymelda,
the castle’s head cook. Unknown to Tasper, she was
recently killed by Lord Nodlock’s pack of hunting dogs.
The castle’s inhabitants are under strict instructions
to string Tasper along. As long as it believes Grymelda
lives, it cheerfully serves as head wine taster.

The Tea Tent and the Dreaming Snail

0211

Wild, rolling meadows of knee-high grass inhabited by legions of curious rabbits.
Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 1-in-6 likely
(2-in-6 likely at night) to be with 1d3+2 bandits (Level
1 thieves—DMB) and 1d3+2 shorthorns (DMB)—
members of the gang based in hex 0311. Opposing side
has a 3-in-6 chance of being surprised, due to bandits
hiding in the woods.

Along Bove’s Road
Bove’s Road is a well-frequented roadway skirting the edge
of Dolmenwood. To the south, there are endless leagues
of windswept meadows, while the north offers only the
brooding, sentient presence of the ancient wood.
In winter: Frequent gusts blowing unimpeded over the
rolling plains chill travellers to the bone.
In summer: Exposed in the open with no shade, the
summer sun beats down on travellers with thirst and
prickling sweat.
Psychic snail emanations: Those with some degree of
psychic sensitivity (arcane spell-casters or the psionically gifted) may experience flash images of snail-covered bodies when traversing this stretch of road. These
emanate from the giant psionic snail (DMB) that lies in
a century-long slumber, curled in its moss-covered shell,
resting in a ditch beneath the forest eaves to the north (see
The Dreaming Snail).

The Tea Tent
Alongside the road, about halfway across the hex, a bright
pink, conical tent is erected. A snail-emblazoned banner
flaps outside and smoke chuffs merrily from a stovepipe.
During clement weather, wooden stools and benches may
be seen arrayed near the entrance.
Inquiring within: One encounters the proprietor, a man
who calls himself Smalding Borotrope, as well as 1d6 other
visiting travellers.

The Dreaming Snail (Hidden)
In a damp depression amid a thicket of ferns in the woods
north of the road lies a giant psionic snail (DMB), deep in
slumber.
Moss-coated shell: The snail is concealed beneath a
thick carpet of Mind-Moss (p430). Carefully harvesting
a portion requires a Dexterity Check. Failing the check
awakens the snail.

Smalding Borotrope
The psionic snail usually interacts with the world via
its projected dream avatar: a rotund human man with
slimy skin, a wiry moustache, and a preposterous hat.
Demeanour (Lawful): Garrulous, cordial, a bit nosey.

Tea time: In copper vessels atop a cast iron stove, Smalding
cooks up a refreshing brew of tea, which he offers at 2cp a
mug.

Speech: Loquacious, prone to odd non-idiomatic
phrases. Strangely-accented Woldish.

Drinking and resting: Smalding’s hot tea proves to be
just the thing to beat back the chill from the grassland
gales of winter, and his iced tea is the perfect antidote to
the thirst of summer road travel. In any season, staying,
resting a while, and enjoying at least two mugs of the tea
has a remarkably recuperative effect upon weary travellers
(heal 1 HP).

Giant Psionic Snail

More emanations of the snail: The tent and its proprietor,
while they appear real to those who encounter them, are
psychic projections of the giant snail.
Detecting and dispelling: Spells such as Dweomerlight
reveal the quasi-real nature of the tea tent. Casting Dispel
Magic causes the scene to vanish and the snail to awaken.

Desires: Invariably delighted to chat with travellers,
offer them a cup of refreshing brew, and hear stories.

10′-round, deep purple shell, covered in moss. The
snail’s body is orange and its curious eyes are golden.
Demeanour (Lawful): Surprised and disgruntled at
being awoken. Make a Reaction Roll (see Encounters—
DPB), modified by any previous interactions with Borotrope.
Speech: Sagacious, obtuse. Telepathic projection.
Desires: If friendly, asks for feedback on Borotrope’s
verisimilitude; otherwise wishes only to be left alone
and return to slumber and projection.

The Ruins of Smerne

Pools of black, iridescent water. Abandoned peat beds riddled with ditches and collapsed banks.
Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Horridwort (p430), in addition to the normal results.

The Ruins of Smerne
The remnants of an abandoned village sit in the midst of
the fens, sinking slowly, over the course of the long, lonely
years, into a bog. Crows roost amid the ruins, bitterly
cawing at intruders into their realm.
Structures: Wooden houses built upon stilts now kiss the
sodden ground, drystone walls are collapsed into heaps,
and sturdy dwellings of stone lie slumped, half submerged
beneath the mire.
Exploring: The few still-intact interior spaces are filled
with sludge, brambles, and decaying leaves.
Wolf statue: In the centre of the ruined settlement, the
statue of a great, shaggy wolf still stands, its head raised
as if defiantly howling at the sky. The pedestal on which
the statue stands is engraved with the word “Egrydgenn.”
(Dewidort of Smerne—infamous highwayman and scion of
this desolate place—used this word as the magical means
of revealing his treasure hoard. See 0607.)

The Ghosts of Smerne

Church and graveyard: The leaning posts of a ruined stave
church stand, ribcage-like, at the north of the village—a
favoured roosting place for the crows. Surrounding the
church, the tops of a few dozen almost-submerged gravestones peek out of the mire.

A roiling cluster of colourless, vaporous spirits, with
stretched, gaping mouths, clawed, grasping hands,
and baleful holes of blackness where their eyes should
be. Dressed in ragged leather and dented wolf’s-head
helms, with hoods of moss draped over their shoulders.
The ghosts number some three dozen, but speak in
unison and attack as a single combatant, their deathless
minds merged into a cacophony of hunger.

Touching the graves: Awakens the Ghosts of Smerne, who
rush from the black, boggy earth like a cloying, twisting
smoke, whirling around those who disturb their rest.

Demeanour (Neutral): Desperately hungry, plead for
vittles favoured in life (e.g. smoked fish, blackbird pie,
mulled wine). Attack if mocked or provoked.
Speech: Plaintive babbling. Woldish.
Desires: Filling food and hearty drink.
Reward: If sated (requires at least 10 rations), the ghosts
sigh and dissipate, giving their blessing to those who
pitied them. All characters present gain a +4 bonus to
the next Saving Throw they roll against a deadly effect.

effects (e.g. disease, poison) and mind-affecting spells

Immunities: Only harmed by magic or magic weapons.
Horde: The ghosts make a single Attack Roll against all
creatures within a 20′ radius area.
Chill: Victims lose 1 Constitution per hit. If reduced to
0 Constitution, the victim turns to ash and blows away
with the wind. Lost Constitution recovers at a rate of
one point per day.

The Stone Woods

0302

Sludgy layers of black, brown, and red earth, teeming with flies and creeping newts.
Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Marshwick (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

Grey, Leafless Trees
Copses of leafless, grey trees are dotted across the barren,
boggy expanse of this hex.
Approaching: At 100 yards distance, it becomes clear
that the trees are dead. They stand at odd angles, some
partially submerged in pools of stagnant water. They have
no twigs—only their largest limbs remain.
Close up: It becomes apparent that the trees are actually
made of stone.
Touching: One who touches the trees with a bare hand
experiences a momentary reverie in which they see the
foetid bog transformed into a lush meadow and the trees
flourishing and laden with blossom.
History: This region was once woodland, and part of the
dominion of the wicked Lady of Spring Unending (see
p33). With each act of cruelty she has committed, her
realm has diminished. Over time, this has caused the once
vibrant woods here to turn to lifeless stone, and her power
over this region to dissipate.

Sludge Trail
A 10′ wide trail of sludge crosses the hex, as if a giant plough
has furrowed the boggy earth.
Following the trail: The trail leads north-west to the lost
Shrine of St Quister.

The Shrine to St Quister (Hidden)
In the far north-west of the hex stands the lost shrine to St
Quister—a narrow, blocky structure of granite, half buried
in a disturbed mound of boggy earth.
Movement: An unknown force drags the shrine slowly
through the mire on a course to the north-west. At intervals, the shrine shudders, creaks, and carves its way
another half-inch through the bog, moving a total of
around 5′ per day.
Statue of St Quister: 4′ tall, carved in green marble. The
saint is depicted squatting beside a hunting hound, pouring wine from a bottle into his loyal companion’s mouth.
Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of St
Quister: the ability to cast Create Water. See Shrines, p22.

0303

Mother Efte’s Lair

Perpetual drizzle. Festering pools and animal skeletons. Crows circle overhead, seeking carrion.
Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions of
Lilywhite (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

Perpetual Rain
Whatever the prevailing weather conditions elsewhere,
this hex is wreathed in an interminable drizzle. The rain
becomes heavier toward the centre of the hex, where
Mother Efte’s Lair is located.

Riverside Traps
The Hameth and its environs here are fraught with danger,
for this is the hunting ground of the numerous madtoms
(DMB) who dwell in Mother Efte’s Lair.
Mantraps: Travellers walking along the riverbank or navigating small vessels have a 3-in-6 chance of encountering
one of the madtoms’ traps (see madtom, DMB). Anyone
falling prey is attacked by 2d8 madtoms, leaping from
the river.

Mother Efte’s Lair
Coalesced beside the sluggish crawl of the Upper Hameth
is a 100-yard-wide pool of black, muddy water, ringed with
collapsing willows and spiny teasels, reflecting the dreary,
rainy sky. Mother Efte reclines in the pool, gaping mouth
pointed skywards, guzzling the perpetual rain. Her servants—30 madtoms (DMB)—loll in psychedelic ecstasy,
under the effects of their mistress’s pus (see Mother Efte).
Dais and podium: A dais of lichen-chewed flagstones is
located in the mud at one side of the pool. Upon the dais
stands a white marble podium, stylised with carvings of
fruiting vines. Crystal clear water rests in the bowl-like top
of the podium. The water is pure and good to drink, and
can never be exhausted.
Rain making: The dais has the power to conjure rains, even
violent storms, in the Northern Scratch. Mother Efte knows
the ancient command words that control this magic, using
it to wreathe her home in endless precipitation. The magically conjured rain slowly causes her body to grow ever
more massive.
If threatened: Mother Efte croaks out command words that
cause the dais’s magic to conjure a shroud of fog around
the pool, reducing visibility to 10′.
Treasure: The madtoms’ ill-gotten gains, buried in sacks at
the pool’s bottom: 3,300gp, 2,450cp, 4 snake-shaped silver
brooches (200gp each), 5 small diamonds (250gp each).

Mother Efte
A 12′ long giant newt with pink eyes, indigo skin, feathery, purple gills, and patches of oozing, orange warts
along her back. Mother Efte was once human—an
apprentice of the witch Lady Haeroth (p76) who
stole her mistress’s jade necklace by swallowing it. After
fleeing the lady’s manor, a curse upon the jewels transformed Efte into a newt. Decades later, she has forgotten
her past life, save her festering hatred of Lady Haeroth.
Demeanour (Neutral): Lethargic, slow-witted. Greedily
eyes characters she suspects may have magic.
Speech: Languorous belching. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: To gorge on magic, grow ever greater, and one
day wreak vengeance upon Lady Haeroth. Would pay up
to 500gp per spell or item fed to her (see Eating magic,
below), but initially offers only 100gp.
Possessions: The stolen jade necklace (worth 2,000gp—
or 3,000gp if returned to Lady Haeroth) is still lodged
in Efte’s belly.
Wart pus: The warts on Efte’s back ooze a milky pus.
Consuming has the effects of Sclubber’s Twist (p430).

weapons at –2 Attack; body digested 6 Turns after death.
Surviving being swallowed: The victim emerges with
the stolen jade necklace (see Possessions).

The Summerstone Sigil

0304

Mossy paths navigate between sodden shallows and impenetrably tangled groves of blackthorn and nettle.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Northern Scr. / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 1-in-6 likely
to be with the Audrune Wargfole as he wanders the
hex, cleaning the Pointing Statues in honour of the
sacrifice they made to maintain the wards against the
Cold Prince.
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Pointing Statues
White marble statues, devoid of blemish or moss, dot the
morose woods of this hex. They depict hunters, warriors,
hermits, and woodcutters, all with one hand raised, pointing toward the centre of the hex—in the direction of the
Soul Pyre.

The Soul Pyre
In a glade of mighty, long-limbed copper beeches at the
centre of the hex is a giant wicker man, 20′ high, ablaze
with an uncanny green flame emanating from within its
belly. The flame does not consume the wicker laths that
form the man.
Approaching: Closer up, distorted faces of mortals grimace
and howl silently within the flickering flame. These are the
souls of victims trapped by the Audrune Wargfole.
Toppling the man: Extinguishes the flame, releases the
trapped souls, and terminates the illusion hiding Sigil (see
The Veiling of Sigil). If a soul’s body has not yet become a
statue (see The Mask and Lamp of Ghrind), the soul returns
to it; otherwise, it moves on to the afterlife.

The Giant Stump (Veiled Nodal)
In the north-west of the hex is a dewy glade riddled with
thick roots growing from a giant tree stump. The stump is
20′ high and 10′ around, coated in lush moss. The roots and
stump are all illusory, veiling the presence of the Summerstone Sigil (see The Veiling of Sigil).
Balmy stillness: The veiled stone is surrounded by a 120yard radius of hazy warmth and balmy stillness of the air,
reminiscent of the intoxicating days of high summer.
Detect illusion: Those who can see through illusions
perceive the Summerstone: a ragged shard of basalt (15′
high, 8′ around). (See The Ring of Chell, p20 for full information on the Summerstones.)
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Dweomerlight. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18
for details on learning this spell.
Touching: One who perceives Sigil and touches it gains a
permanent +1 bonus to Intelligence, and the ability to cast
the holy spell Locate Object once within the next week.

The Veiling of Sigil
The Summerstone Sigil is hidden by an illusion of a
Giant Stump. This powerful illusion cannot be dispelled
and is maintained by the souls fed to the Soul Pyre by
the Audrune Wargfole, using the magical Mask and
Lamp of Ghrind. The Pointing Statues littering the hex
are the petrified bodies of those robbed of their souls.

The Audrune Wargfole
A frail old human man, bent and hooded, leaning on
his walking staff and carrying a lamp of polished bone
that burns with a shimmering, golden light. Concealed
beneath his cowl, he wears a skull-like mask, also of
bone. Both the lamp and mask are magical—see The
Mask and Lamp of Ghrind.
Demeanour (Neutral): Grim, mournful.
Speech: Croaking whisper. Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: Souls to feed the Soul Pyre—he seeks to drain
them from those who seem worthy of serving a great
cause. Fine ale and provender—he misses the luxuries
of civilisation.

The Mask and Lamp of Ghrind
A skull-like mask and a lamp, both made from
burnished, lustrous bone. Worth 20,000gp.
Soul draining: Once per day, the lamp has the power to
drain the soul of a person to whom the mask is revealed.
The victim may Save Versus Doom to resist.
Victims’ bodies: Are initially paralysed, then turn into
marble statues over a period of 1d6 weeks.
Restoring: If a victim’s body has not yet turned to stone,
they can be saved by smashing the lamp, releasing their
soul. Trap the Soul (p457) is also effective.

The Boggin’s Lamp

Scrubby heath, mud, and shallow pools. Windless and quiet. Eerie lights and strands of mist drift.
Terrain: Bog (3), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 1d4 marsh lanterns (DMB).
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Oddy Sorrel (p430), in addition to the normal results.

The Boggin’s Lamp (Inn)
A homely inn stands inexplicably in the midst of the trackless bog, its lights flickering welcomingly at all hours.
Sign: A young boy gazing in wonderment at a glowing
crystal pendant held by a cloaked, bearded hermit.
Interior: Low beams, crackling fire, chunky oak tables
and chairs. Narrow windows look out into the night, whatever time of day a traveller entered. A sign reads “To each
their own rede; to each their own seclusion.” The landlord,
Smauvol Oddnum, serves from a nook lined with bottles.
Guests: A merry assortment of travellers from far-off
places (some real, some imaginary). Carrington Shydewick (going by the name of Mercy Alquip) mingles in the
crowd, contentedly sipping a glass of Underbrood’s Vintage
(DPB). There is a 2-in-6 chance of 1d3 Drune cottagers
(DMB) quietly conversing in a corner.
Protection from divination: The inn is swathed in a
dweomer that stymies all magical scrying and detection.
Food and drink: The inn’s pantries and cellars are magically replenished daily. Items taken from the inn disappear
after 1d6 days.
Origin: A magical lodging of fairy construction, claimed
by the Drune after the Cold Prince was banished.

Services at the Boggin’s Lamp
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB).
Smet: A hearty dish of bread, gravy, turnip, and goose
fat. 4sp.
Wine: The inn stocks all wines listed in the Dolmenwood Player’s Book.
No stabling: The inn has no housing for mounts.

Smauvol Oddnum—Boggin’s Lamp Proprietor
A broad-faced, wide-eyed human man in his late 40s,
with black, shoulder length hair. Wears a chequered
doublet, white hose, pointy shoes, and a brass skull
necklace. Refuses to discuss any of the inn’s peculiarities, merely replying that he keeps his own rede.
Demeanour (Neutral): Smug, enigmatic, mirthful.
Speech: Softly spoken. Shifts between rustic, urban,
and archaic. Woldish, Old Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: Peace and good company. Tales from afar.

216

The Shrine to St Dank (Hidden)
A wooden wayside shrine, now decaying and covered in
moss, lies toppled in the mud beside a reeking pool.
Idol of St Dank: A 2′ square marble relief depicting St Dank
with a great serpent around his neck, flanked by two kneeling longhorn acolytes.
Prayer: If the shrine is righted and cleaned, characters
praying may receive the blessing of St Dank: the ability to
cast Charm Serpents. See Shrines, p22.

Carrington Shydewick (“Mercy Alquip”)
(Level 7 Thief)
A youthful human woman with a button nose, freckles,
a beauty mark, and voluminous golden tresses (a wig).
Wears an extravagant ball gown of turquoise satin,
with a blue leather girdle embossed with silver hops.
Currently lying low in the Boggin’s Lamp after infiltrating the Hall of Sleep (1304) and stealing a platinum
tiara from the sleeping Lady Guillefer.
Demeanour (Neutral): Jaded aesthete. Arches her
brows with curiosity.
Speech: Affected upper class accent. Casually impudent. Woldish.
Desires: Information on tombs, dungeons, and ruins in
the Table Downs. Clues about the location of Dewidort
of Smerne’s lost hoard (see 0607). To undertake thrilling robberies of heavily guarded sites. Has her eye on
Nodding Castle (0210) and the Drune mausoleum on
Phantom Isle (0706).
Possessions: Belt of Might (p406). A Bag of Holding
(p420), containing an Arcane Longsword (p412), 3
Fairy Daggers (p412), 500pp, 1,000gp, and a platinum
tiara stolen from the Hall of Sleep (2,000gp).

Walker’s Void and the Blue Monolith

0306

Great thickets of brambles and bracken, criss-crossed by disused, overgrown paths.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Walker’s Void
In a clearing, a perfectly circular, 10′-diameter pit in the
ground opens into a shaft containing an impenetrable
black void. Ringing the hole are a set of ropes secured to
stakes; several ropes are tautly attached to something in
the pit. Wooden beams and planks are stacked about the
clearing, and the ground is scattered with nails, sawdust,
and other signs of carpentry. Nearby stands a simple shack.
Dubious ladder: The taut ropes are attached to the top
of a rickety ladder, suspended in the abyss of the pit. The
ladder dangles precipitously and stretches out of sight. It
is of shoddy construction, composed of varying types of
wood, with many of its rungs oddly angled.
Walker: There is a 3-in-6 chance that the clearing’s inhabitant, Walker, is present, preparing to add a new section
of rungs to the top of the ladder and lower the extended
structure into the pit. Otherwise, she returns in 1d10 Turns.
Descending: The ladder descends 200′, then ends abruptly
with no shaft bottom in sight. For every 10′ traversed, there
is a 1% chance that the entire structure fails and plummets
into the shaft below, taking anyone on the ladder with it,
and earning Walker’s enmity.
Treasure cache: 25′ down the ladder, a chunk of cork plugs
a hole containing 287sp, 75gp, a silver Ring of Mortality
(p410) with a Drunic owl signet, and a handwritten
letter. Worn from touch and faintly perfumed, the letter
is addressed to “Melisse” (Walker’s former name), from a
person called “Allendra,” ending their romantic relationship. Walker fights to the death to protect this treasure.

Walker the Mad Ladderer
A human woman in her late 50s, with long white hair,
dark eyes, and numerous scars. Dresses in threadbare
forest garb. Lives as a hermit, consumed by her obsession with finding the bottom of the hole.
Demeanour (Neutral): Wary and unfriendly, but warms
to anyone who agrees with the worthiness of her perilous, idiosyncratic goal of reaching the pit bottom.
Speech: Well-spoken though vague. Woldish.
Desires: To build the ladder until it reaches the bottom
of the hole. Solitude.
Combat stats: Level 1 hunter—DMB. Fights with a small
hammer (1d4 damage).

The pit’s nature: The pit has no bottom. Anything or
anyone that falls in simply falls forever.

The Blue Vorpal Monolith
In the east of this hex, a 20′-high spectral monolith of azure
light hovers in a tangled dell. This is one of the mysterious
vorpal monoliths that trace an emergent fifth ley line in
Dolmenwood (see Vorpal Monoliths, p19). In summer,
autumn, and winter, the monolith is a mere shimmering
figment. In spring, it becomes semi-corporeal.
Viewing: All who behold the monolith in the spring must
Save Versus Spell. Arcane spell-casters gain a +2 bonus.
Those who fail change to a random Alignment immediately and upon awakening every subsequent day.
Touching: In its springtime manifestation, the monolith’s
partially tangible surface feels like warm honey. Spells of
healing cast while touching the monolith are doubled in
potency. In other seasons, a PC touching the monolith’s
diaphanous outline temporarily experiences the pleasant,
agreeable balm of a mild spring day.

217

0307 Fungal Forms and the Ascension Stone
Overgrown paths in nonsensical routes, criss-crossing, doubling back, and spiralling into dead ends.
Terrain: Hilly forest (3), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Humanoid Fungus
Throughout the hex, lumpy, vibrantly hued fungus grows
in unmistakably humanoid shapes, reclining on mossy
tussocks among the damp dales. The fungi vary in size
from dainty, hand-sized manikins to sprawling, 12′ giants.
Eating: The fungus tastes bland and has no nutritive or
special qualities.
At night: As dusk falls, mouths bloom open upon the
fungi’s heads, and begin puffing whispering sighs of
coloured spores. PCs who stop to observe hear scattered
words among the sighs, relating to their current quest or
mission. At the Referee’s discretion, the fungi may relay
brief words of oracular advice.

Ascension Stone (Hidden)
At the heart of the hex’s byzantine labyrinth of paths is a
treeless hill. At its summit stands a smooth-sided boulder
of black stone, about human height.
The stone: On its eastern face is a carving of serene, praying woman being lifted into the clouds by a pair of angels.
On the western face, the name “ABYGAIL” is carved.
Holy spell-casters: Who make an Intelligence Check
realise this is the lost site of the legendary Ascension of
Abygail, sought by the Pluritine Church.
Prayer: Characters praying hear a young woman’s voice,
asking them to report the stone’s location to the current
Bishop of Brackenwold.

218

Sainthood: Should an official Pluritine Church delegation
visit the site and bear witness of its existence to Bishop
Sanguine (p69), Abygail will be accepted into the host of
saints. The Ascension Stone then becomes a site of pilgrimage and may, if the Referee wishes, gain the powers of a
shrine (see Shrines, p22) with a new holy spell associated with Abygail.
History: 150 years ago, a pious pilgrim named Abygail
Grynn spent a night alone praying atop the hill. In the
morning, her fellow pilgrims watched awestruck as she
slowly ascended into the heavens and disappeared forever
“as if carried aloft by invisible angels.” The stone was placed
and carved by those who witnessed the event, many of
whom devoted the rest of their days petitioning the Church
for Abygail to be given sainthood. Under the pernicious
influence of Atanuwë, the site has been lost, veiled in the
labyrinthine pathways of this hex.

The Face of the Drune

0308

Granite cliffs in eroding hillsides topped with leaning, blue-leafed pines.
Terrain: Hilly forest (3), High Wold / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Rindlewort (p430), in addition to the normal results.

The Great Stone Face
Overlooking a shady dale is a great stone face, 15′ high,
carved into a sheer, granite cliff, 10′ from the ground. The
crude relief depicts the scowling visage of a stern-eyed
man with a great, wizardly beard. Below the beard, a green
copper door is set into the rock-face.
Inspecting the face: Reveals that the pupils of its eyes
are holes, 1′ in diameter, opening onto utter darkness (see
Inside the Cave).
The door: Bears the Drunic inscription, “Render Magus.”
It is sealed with a Glyph of Locking (Level 7 caster). Beyond
the door is a large cave (see Inside the Cave).
History: Render Magus was a Drune of some power, now
dead for many centuries, who made his home here.

Inside the Cave
The cave is a dry, musty chamber, about 40′ wide and
deep and 20′ high. It is dominated by the carving on its
front wall—aligned with the great stone face on its other
side, it depicts the interior anatomy of the front of a skull,
including teeth, sinuses, and some portions of the brain,
all labelled with obscure Drunic anatomical terms.
Furnishings: At the very back lies a forlorn, unmade bed,
its wooden frame engraved with clustered brambles, and a
matching chest. Beneath the bed’s verminous mattress is a
forgotten Arcane Dagger (p412), engraved with “THORN”
in Drunic. The chest contains three tattered black robes.
Inhabitant: A spirit of green fire, created by Magus and
named Tinekin, guards the meagre remains of its master’s
lair. It hides beneath the bed, observing intruders.
Disturbing the cave: Should PCs attempt to remove any
items, look under the bed, or study the cave’s hidden spell
(see At night), Tinekin darts out and confronts them, madly
uttering threats as it capers about the chamber. If the
adventurers persist, Tinekin attacks.

Tinekin
A diminutive humanoid (3′ high) composed entirely of
the green fire over which the Drune have mastery. Its
flames do no damage unless it wills them to.
Demeanour (Neutral): Belligerent and paranoid, with
an undercurrent of loneliness.
Speech: Staccato rambling in a rapid, high-pitched hiss.
Woldish, Old Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: To ensure the safety of Magus’s decayed,
useless possessions. Craves a new master and companion (a human arcane spell-caster of at least Level 7).
Binding: An enchantment set by a Level 7 caster binds
Tinekin to the cave, breakable by Dispel Magic.

Immunities: Only harmed by magic or magic weapons.
Burning: Anyone damaged by the unearthly green fire
of Tinekin’s hands suffers a painful burn: –2 penalty to
Attack Rolls for 1 Turn.
Return from death: If slain while within the cave,
Tinekin reforms in 1 hour.

At night: When moonlight shines through the eyes of the
stone face, a glowing, ghostly script is projected onto the
cave floor. Casting Decipher on the script reveals the text of
the spell Dimension Door. An arcane spell-caster who studies the script (4 hours) may copy this spell into a spell book.

0309

Garnack’s Tower

Birches rise from the sodden ground, impaled spear-like through the rotten remains of once greater trees.
Terrain: Hilly forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Ramshackle Tower
Seemingly only upright due to the straining efforts of
buckling scaffolds, a three-storey peel tower stands with
an almost defiant pride on a bald hill overlooking the High
Road and the surrounding woods. It is the home and headquarters of the brutish longhorn hedge knight, Garnack
the Horse.
Door: The door to the tower is a grand wooden affair of oak,
emblazoned with the cruel faces of wood spirits and rapacious swine, battered towards its hinges from the wounds
of an ancient siege.
Interior: The tower’s layout includes a large common
room coated in louse-ridden animal pelt rugs, an armoury,
shorthorn quarters, a small larder (originally a dungeon
for prisoners), and Garnack’s chambers.
Garnack’s quarters: The hedge knight’s personal quarters
are on the top floor of the tower, behind a door secured with
a half-dozen locks. Within this locked room Garnack keeps
scarce furnishings and a few trophies from conquests of
old (see Garnack’s Hoard).
Inhabitants: Garnack himself, and 12 shorthorns (DMB),
who maintain the grounds and spend their lives suffering
the rigours of their master’s rules.

Garnack’s Hoard
The following treasures are contained in an old wooden
footlocker beneath Garnack’s bed:
Coins: 370gp, 229sp, 1,321cp.
Damaged gold medallion: A 3″ medallion studded with red
garnets forming the gnarled eye emblem of House Ramius.
A large blade scar reduces the item’s value to 800gp. (Skilfully repaired, it would be worth 1,500gp.)
Three bottles of mead: Bearing the mark of Shobrattle’s
brewery in Dreg. Worth 36sp each.

Garnack the Horse (Level 5 Fighter)
A corpulent longhorn man with matted, greying fur,
eyes of deep red, and one broken horn. Has a vicious
reputation, earned through bloody service in the many
wars amongst the longhorn noble houses and against
the Drune.
Demeanour (Neutral): Stern and utterly humourless.
Eyes strangers up and down, as if assessing their worth
as battle fodder.
Speech: Ominous rumbling. Woldish, Caprice, Gaffe.
Desires: Well-remunerated employment in military
campaigns of any kind. Also open to joining adventurers on daring escapades. To marry Jesmerelda, daughter
of Lord Ramius (p65).
Possessions: Truespite, a large Arcane Warhammer
(Drune Bane, p412) especially enchanted for crushing the skulls of Drunes. Its handle is of thunderstruck
elm; its head is of fused and compacted breggle horns.

A human shin bone: Etched with Drunic runes relating
the deeds of an ancient Drune. Worth 150gp if sold to the
Drune, though the transaction also arouses the suspicions
of the Aegis (p54) towards the sellers.

The Shrine to St Hamfast (Hidden)

Drune map: A fragment of an old map, written in Drunic,
indicating the location of a dark tower upon an island in
the Brinemere (hex 1103). The phrase “Aubrathon—Traitor
to his kind” is inscribed in red beside the tower.

Stepping onto the island: Unbalances it, tipping the shrine
into the pool.

The Twice-Wreathed Door (Hidden)
In a glade of holly atop a steep knoll floats a sphere of
porous black rock wreathed in sheets of flame and whirling snow.
Wreaths of flame and snow: Both are illusory and emit
no heat or cold.
Touching the sphere: Whisks one away to the fairy road
The Narrow Way (see Fairy Roads, p26).

220

Bobbing precariously upon a floating moss island amid a
small pond is a wooden wayside shrine.

Statue of St Hamfast: A rosewood statue of Hamfast as a
friar, with a squirrel on his shoulder and a songbird in his
palm. Thorny shoots and black roses sprout from the wood.
Prayer: If the shrine is brought to stable ground and the
statue pruned, characters praying may receive the blessing
of St Hamfast: the ability to cast Speak With Animals. See
Shrines, p22.

The Craven Mounds

0310

Eerie silence. The loose soil seethes with carnivorous beetles.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with an insect swarm (DMB)—the flesh-eating
beetles that swarm this hex.
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.

Mounds and Boulders
Scattered throughout the hex are earthen mounds, some
up to 10′ high, devoid of any vegetation or fungi. They are
topped with clusters of large boulders.
Carved faces: Every boulder has a side covered by a carved
face, invariably a visage depicting at once torment and
wickedness.
Foreign stone: Those who have spent time in the hills and
crags of the High Wold may notice that the stone is not of
local origin.
History: Chiselled in ancient days by the Drune, these
boulders were carved in effigy of woods-folk chiefs who
bowed to the Cold Prince and refused to join the Triple
Compact (see History, p14). By use of most horrendous
ritual the Drune pulled the souls from these chieftains and
their heirs and bound them within the stones to scream
silently until the sun grows cold. The Drune dub this prison
the “Craven Mounds.”

At Night
When night falls, the tormented spirits of the fallen chiefs
begin to drip from the maws and eyes of the effigies. They
seep down into the cold, loose earth in hopes of finding
mortal bodies to infest and use as temporary hosts with
which to take out their fury on the Drune. Most have little
luck beyond parleying with the petty minds of beetles.
Sleeping: Any mortal or demi-fey foolish enough to rest
here must Save Versus Doom. Those who succeed retch up
the gruesome spirits attempting to possess them; those
unfortunate souls who fail become thralls to the liquid
slithering shadows (see Shadow’s Thrall) until dawn or
until dragged from this hex.

The Shrine to St Elsa (Hidden)
The point of a tiled roof is all the remains visible of the lost
shrine to St Elsa, submerged beneath a mound of loose soil,
writhing with carnivorous beetles.
Clearing the shrine: Treat the swarming beetles as an
insect swarm (DMB).
Structure: A simple wayside shrine with wooden sides
and a tiled roof.
Statue of St Elsa: A wooden carving depicting St Elsa atop
a tall tower, gazing up to heaven.
Prayer: If the shrine is cleared, characters praying may
receive the blessing of St Elsa: the ability to cast Communion. See Shrines, p22.

Shadow’s Thralls
Those possessed by the dripping shadows are drained
of colour, and appear as amalgams of spectral and
rotten flesh.
Size, Type, Intelligence as Original—Chaotic

Level 2 AC 14 HP 2d8 (9) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att Touch (+1, 1d6 + chill) Speed 30 Morale 12 XP 35
Possessed: Despite its appearance, a shadow’s thrall is
possessed, not undead, and cannot be turned.
Chill touch: Victims lose 1 Strength per hit, with death
at 0 Strength. Lost Strength recovers at dawn.
Dawn light: The touch of the light of dawn exorcises
and defeats a shadow, ending the possession and
returning the thrall to their normal state.
Dragging from hex 0310: Dragging a shadow’s thrall
from this hex also ends the possession.

221

0311

Bandit Hideout

A seldom-trod woodland of tangled oak and elm, littered with decaying branches and mouse nests.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Daytime encounters are 1-in-6
likely to be with 1d3+2 bandits (Level 1 thieves—DMB)
and 1d3+2 shorthorns (DMB)—members of the gang
based in this hex. Opposing side has a 3-in-6 chance of
being surprised, due to bandits hiding in the woods.

Bandit Territory
The southern half of this hex is the territory of a band of
human and shorthorn bandits. Led by the notorious Red
Gwen, this gang strikes merchant caravans along an 18
mile stretch of Bove’s Road to the south of here (hexes 0211,
0312, 0411), fading into the safety of the Dolmenwood with
their plunder.
Net traps: Those who traverse this region have a 3-in-6
chance of triggering a net trap. Each party member must
then Save Versus Hold or be hoisted 20′ off ground and
ensnared (treat as a Web spell). A patrol of 1d3+2 bandits
(Level 1 thieves—DMB) and 1d3+2 shorthorns (DMB)
arrives in 1d4 Turns to capture the prisoners and lead them,
bound and blindfolded, to the Treehouse.

Treehouse (Hidden)
At the heart of the bandits’ territory is their hidden headquarters: an elaborate, heavily camouflaged treehouse
consisting of multiple platforms and eclectic, bough-hugging domiciles, connected by hanging bridges, ladders,
and ropes. It spans four adjacent, ancient elm trees. Two
retractable rope ladders and a cargo winch provide access.
Inhabitants: 12 shorthorns (DMB), 10 bandits (Level 1
thieves—DMB), and their leader, Red Gwen.

Red Gwen—Bandit Leader (Level 4 Fighter)
A tall, lithe half-breggle, half-human woman dressed in
chainmail and a black tunic. Her thick, tightly curled,
flaming red hair frames a pointed, shrewd face and
twinkling, goat-like eyes. Gwen’s hold over her gang
stems from her tactical brilliance, and from the carefully cultivated tale of her origins—namely, that she
is the exiled younger sister of Lord Murkin (p65),
whose title she will one day usurp. In truth, Gwen grew
up as an urchin on the streets of High-Hankle. The longhorn nobles find her claims an amusing sideshow to
their own more deadly political intrigues.
Demeanour (Neutral): Charming, energetic, droll.
Speech: Dramatic, littered with swashbuckling clichés
like “stand and deliver.” Affected Gaffe accent. Woldish,
Caprice, Gaffe.
Desires: To continue her exhilarating career of adventure and thievery. To build her myth of breggle nobility
without actually confronting Murkin. To rob the longhorn mercenary Garnack the Horse (hex 0309), who
owes Gwen an unpaid gambling debt.
Possessions: Holy Dagger (p412) engraved with howling skulls. The key to the Treasury.

222

Common area: A 20′-diameter platform where the bandits
muster for their forays, count their spoils, and idly drink,
gamble, and engage in ribaldry. A thick branch bisects the
space, upon which Red Gwen sits and holds court.
Treasury: A locked hut near the common area contains:
6,500gp, 12,500sp, a large assortment of furs (300gp), 6
barrels of Cobsworth Pale Ale (DPB, 62gp / 124 pints each),
20 bottles of Prigwort Pure (DPB, 35sp / 5 glasses each), 10
bottles of Lord Oberon’s Ambrosial (DPB, 5gp / 5 glasses
each), 20 crates of Dusty Abbot and Westling’s Weed (DPB,
10gp / 50 smokes each), and a pair of woollen trousers
crafted by Mannog that magically transform the wearer’s
appearance to that of a woodgrue (200gp, see hex 0411).
Visitors: The fate of prisoners depends on their knowledge
of the treehouse’s location, whether they have harmed the
bandits, their potential profit as hostages, and Red Gwen’s
mood. One can expect anything from ransoming to execution, though the most likely fate is to be deposited at the
edge of the wood, stripped of all but clothes. Adventurers
who impress Gwen may gain a peaceful audience with her.

Mother Goat’s Place

0312

Placid grasslands dotted with cave-riddled sandstone outcroppings.
Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Daytime encounters are 1-in-6
likely to be with 1d3+2 bandits (Level 1 thieves—DMB)
and 1d3+2 shorthorns (DMB)—members of the gang
based in hex 0311. Opposing side has a 3-in-6 chance of
being surprised, due to bandits hiding in the woods.
Nighttime encounters are 3-in-6 likely to be with 1d4+2
wolves (DMB), who taunt PCs in growled Woldish and
attack if they outnumber the party.

Along Bove’s Road
Bove’s Road is a well-frequented roadway skirting the edge
of Dolmenwood. South of the road, open meadows and
plains stretch as far as the eye can see, while to the north, a
gentle upward slope climbs for about a mile until it reaches
the eaves of the ancient wood.

Mother Goat’s Place (Inn)
At a bend in the road near the north-western corner of
the hex is a sprawling, ramshackle inn maintained by a
shorthorn woman (DMB), Mother Goat, and her 7 kids.
Sign: A goat and wolf head facing each other in profile, a
steaming tureen beneath them.
Common room: Shouting, laughter, and bleating contrast
with the silence of the lands outside. Mother Goat is always
at the centre of things, telling bawdy jokes or chastising
rowdy patrons. The interior stinks of goatish sweat.
Guests: Most of the inn’s visitors are shorthorn and human
merchants travelling between Nodding Castle (hex 0210)
and the High Wold settlements to the east, but intrepid
hunters, adventurers, and even the occasional longhorn
sometimes make their way here.
Rumours and intrigue: The establishment lies within the
territory of Lord Ramius (p65), who is indifferent to
activities at the inn to the point of sometimes forgetting its
existence. Patrons thus speak freely, making the inn a hub
of gossip about goings-on in the High Wold (see High-Hankle Rumours, p447 and Lankshorn Rumours, p448).
Treasure: Mother Goat keeps two chests in her room: one
with 1,375cp and one with 1,925sp. She also has a golden
chalice worth 130gp (obtained from someone who didn’t
have exact change and didn’t want to wash dishes—see
Services at Mother Goat’s Place).

Mother Goat—Shorthorn Landlady
A youthful, lithe-limbed shorthorn woman with coarse
brown fur with yellow spots. Wears colourful patchwork dresses and always has a mop close at hand.
Demeanour (Neutral): Merry, ribald.
Speech: Shrill vibrato. Woldish, Gaffe.
Desires: Unusual cheeses of all kinds. Wishes to set up
a cheese manufactory alongside the inn.
Knowledge: Has heard rumour of a creature made of
cheese deep in the woods of Dwelmfurgh. (Hex 0405.)

The Inn at Night
Wolf visitors: Shortly after sundown, 1d4+2 wolves (DMB)
scratch at the inn’s doors and windows. Mother Goat and
regular guests are untroubled by the sounds. At times
the innkeeper may be seen conversing in hushed tones
through a window with the creatures, which speak surprisingly eloquent Woldish, in gravelly tones. The wolves are
friendly with Mother Goat and her kids, and would fight
to protect them.
Mother Goat’s wolf: In the wee hours, bestial moaning
sometimes can be heard from Mother Goat’s room as she
entertains her favourite wolf.

Services at Mother Goat’s Place
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB). Mother
Goat insists upon payment in exact change; those without exact change must wash dishes.
“Mother’s Surprise”: A dish of stewed game meats
served on a choucroute of field grasses, at 1sp per small
helping. The types of meat are a “special secret,” according to Mother Goat; in truth they are muskrat, vole, and
shrew, from kills delivered to her doorstep in the jaws of
her lupine paramour as tokens of his affection.

The Hanging Tree

Sodden ground with heaps of decaying plant matter. Twisting wisps of yellowish mist grasp at travellers.
Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.

Wisp Lake
A broad, shallow expanse of brackish, yellowish water,
shunned by all living creatures. Wisps of mist dance and
twirl above the lake’s surface at all times.
Roiling fog: An unholy sympathy exists between the eerie
waters of Wisp Lake and the gallowgeist spirits that haunt
the Hanging Tree on its shore. While gallowgeists pursue
adventurers, a thick fog rolls off the lake, making navigation difficult. The chance of getting lost rises to 4-in-6.

The Hanging Tree
Near the western shore of Wisp Lake, a great tree stands
gnarled and dead amidst a small copse of willows. 5 corpses
dangle unmistakably from its twisted branches like macabre fruit.
Inspecting the corpses: Reveals them to be identical to the
bodies of up to five of the PCs, down to the smallest scar
or blemish. Carved into the flesh of each corpse is a word
or short phrase describing the worst crime or vice of the
person mimicked (e.g. “murder,” “theft,” or “greed”) in the
course of their travels in Dolmenwood.
Departing: The hanging corpses are gallowgeists and
pursue once the party is out of sight, accompanied by a
roiling fog (see Wisp Lake).
History: Many years past, the now-abandoned village of
Smerne (hex 0301) used the tree for hanging accused criminals—both the guilty and the innocent. The spirits of the
hanged inhabit the tree, with several manifesting as the
gallowgeists.

Gallowgeists
Ragged skeletal remnants of people hanged and left
to be picked bare by crows, now reanimated as hateful undead. Still hanging at the site of their execution,
these monsters can mimic the form of a living person,
aiming to kill them and assume their identity.
Medium Undead—Sentient—Chaotic

Level 3 AC 13 HP 3d8 (13) Saves D11 R12 H13 B14 S15
Att Bite (+2, 1d3) or weapon (+2) Speed 30 Morale 9
XP 90
Undead: Silent before attacking. Immune to biological
effects (e.g. disease, poison) and mind-affecting spells
(e.g. Vapours of Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).
Doppelgänger flesh: When a living person approaches
a hanging gallowgeist, dead flesh manifests around
its bones, exactly mimicking the appearance of the
person approaching. The corpse has no possessions
and is clothed in rags.
Pursuit: Once out of sight of the living, the corpse
unties its noose and creeps after the person mimicked,
magically sensing their location. It does not stop until
the victim is slain.
Identity stealing: If a gallowgeist slays the person it
has mimicked, it steals their soul, gaining access to
their memories. The monster then enters a semi-living
state, with warm flesh and blood (but is still treated as
undead, for magical purposes). Until the gallowgeist is
killed, attempts to raise the victim from the dead fail.
If killed: The gallowgeist’s restless spirit returns to its
site of execution and re-manifests its physical form
after 1 day.
Burial: Can only be permanently dispatched if buried
and given proper rites.

The Lady of Spring Unending

0402

Serene glades of anemones, celandine, and bluebells. Vernal clemency and eerie silence prevail.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Ever-Blossoming Death Glades
The serene woodland glades in the dread domain of the
Lady of Spring Unending are enchanting but deadly.
Enchantment: Mortals and demi-fey who wander among
the death glades must Save Versus Doom or become
suffused with drowsy wonder. Enchanted characters suffer
a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws while in this
hex, and continue to wander, eventually discovering The
Lady’s Palace unless led out by unaffected party members.

The Lady’s Palace
A palace of white marble spires and crystalline cupolas,
set beside a mist-shrouded pool amid meandering acres
of meadows, ornamental rose gardens, and trellis-lined
avenues.
Interior: The front door—tall, narrow and arched—stands
unlocked, giving way to a labyrinth of immaculate, lifeless
halls. Luxurious furnishings lie covered in sterile white
drapes. A cold, blue gloom pervades, dimming all vibrancy.
Exits: It is impossible to retrace one’s steps—only by magic
or with the Lady’s permission can one leave.
Vaults: Beneath the palace, grey, pillared vaults stretch
endlessly, filled with lifelike statues of people, animals,
and monsters. Many are victims of the Lady’s fell magic. In
a particularly bleak and frigid domed chamber, a Petrified
Fairy Heart (p420) lies upon a pedestal.
Inhabitants: The Lady of Spring Unending , her 12 spectral
hounds, and 36 servants—grey-clad human women who
wandered into her domain and were charmed to remain
forever in servitude.
Visitors: The Lady suffers no one to enter her palace or
grounds. Female intruders may be charmed (see the Lady’s
combat stats) to serve in the gardens and vaults. Others are
attacked by 3d4 spectral hounds, or dispatched by the Lady
herself. However, the Lady may converse with any who
mention her half-sister, Princess Andromethia (p34).

Spectral Hounds
Great, smooth-furred hunting hounds, ghostly transparent and wreathed in blue flame.
Medium Monstrosity—Animal Int.—Neutral

Level 3 AC 14 HP 3d8 (13) Saves D11 R12 H13 B14 S15
Att Bite (+2, 1d8) Speed 50 Morale 9 XP 90
Immunities: Only harmed by silver weapons, magic,
or magic weapons.
Blood-curdling baying: Creatures pursued by a group
of spectral hounds must Save Versus Doom or fall to
the ground, stricken with fear and unable to move for
1d4 Rounds. Each character must save once per encounter with spectral hounds.

The Lady of Spring Unending
A tall, elegant elf woman of youthful complexion, with
eyes of crystalline silver and golden hair falling to her
feet. Appears warm and radiant, amid the sombre
gloom of her palace. Clad in gowns of white, with a
pendant of scintillating silver. The Lady is the half-sister of Princess Andromethia (p34), exiled from her
native realm of the Blossom Fields and unable to leave
this hex. See p33 for more details on the Lady.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Hateful. Loves only revenge.
Speech: Mellifluous but bitter. Woldish, Old Woldish,
Sylvan, High Elfish.
Desires: The death of her half-sister, Princess Andromethia (p34). Entrusts willing conspirators with a white
rose whose aroma slays Andromethia. Escape to Fairy.
Rewards: A wish (see p397).
Possessions: Fairy silver star-shaped Talisman of Spell
Reflection (p398, 8 charges).
Medium Fairy—Genius—Chaotic

Sight, Lesser runes (thrice a day) all, Greater runes
(once a day) all, Mighty runes (once a day) Rune of
Death. The Lady can also cast the arcane spell Petrification once a day.
Eternal charm (once a day per target): Can cast a
permanent Dominate on mortals at will. Charmed individuals are caught in a timeless dream and do not age.

0403

Queen Arda’s Demesne

A multitude of tiny brooks trickle down to join the Hameth. Wafts of heady nectar drift on the breeze.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Northern Scr./Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 1-in-6 likely to
be with 1d4 × 10 purple sprites from the Sprite Mound.
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Gigantic Flowers
Around the banks of the Hameth, bounteous clusters of
massive flowers (10′ tall) bloom: white and yellow lilies,
reddish-pink peonies, and dark blue hibiscuses. Their deep
green stalks and lurid petals create a grotesquely gorgeous
tableau.
Soporific smell: The air is humid and heavy with the flowers’ powerful, aromatic scents, evoking strong emotions in
travellers. Lilies entice with the perfume of forbidden love;
peonies soothe with the half-forgotten idyll of a childhood
afternoon; hibiscuses reek of mortal terror.
If the party lingers: Mortals must Save Versus Doom or
fall into a deep, uninterruptible sleep for 4d4 Turns, during
which they are haunted by dreams flavoured with the feelings evoked by the flowers.
Sprite attack: A party deemed sufficiently weakened by the
flowers is ambushed by 30 purple sprites (DMB) from the
Sprite Mound. Flitting from watch-places atop the hideous
blooms, they attack viciously, and attempt to drag dead or
unconscious PCs to the Shambles.
Petals: If a giant flower petal is placed in boiling water
within 1 day of being picked, the resulting tea becomes a
sleep draught with the same effect as the flower’s scent.

Shambles
At the centre of this hex is a glade where a charnel stench
overwhelms even the powerful scents of the giant flowers.
Open-air abattoir: Carrion, bones, and rotted entrails are
scattered throughout the glade. Five human corpses hang
from trees, their blood dripping into tiny bowls. Gut-spattered tables the size of playing cards and various miniature
carving implements lie nearby.
Observing: Characters who watch secretly may observe
1d4 × 5 purple sprites butchering their kills and transporting the constituent parts to the Sprite Mound: meat
and organs bound for the sprites’ kitchens, bones for the
crafting workshops, and skulls planted with seeds to nourish new flowers.

Queen Arda—Sprite Ruler
A purple sprite woman with orange, insectoid eyes and
drifting hair of pure white. A tyrant obsessed with her
prophetic dreams of ruling all Dolmenwood. Tells her
subjects that “big folk” are marauding giants who must
be slain for the sake of the realm.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Bloodthirsty, dour, decadent.
Speech: Warbling, imperious squeaking. Woldish,
Sylvan, High Elfish.
Desires: Worship. Secrets of magic.
Possessions: Fairy silver crown of leaves (200gp). A tiny
(2″) brass Wand of Confusion (p416, 3 charges).
Combat stats: Purple sprite (DMB) with the ability to
cast the following arcane spells once a day each: Glyph
of Sealing, Vapours of Dream, Ventriloquism.

Sprite Mound (Hidden)
Not far from the Shambles stands a 10′-high mound of clay
that might be mistaken for nothing more than a hillock
of earth. Hidden doorways lie at its base, concealed by the
thick grass.
Interior: An impossibly labyrinthine complex of intricate
tunnels and fanciful chambers, including living quarters,
armouries, workshops, kitchens for the preparation of
humanoid flesh, and baroque dining halls.
Inhabitants: 200 purple sprites (DMB) with a murderous,
carnivorous nature instilled by Queen Arda.
Treasure: Behind a tiny locked door at the heart of the
mound is Arda’s treasure chamber, containing three rubies
of increasing sizes (50gp, 100gp, 500gp), a human-sized
necklace of fairy silver, bearing the Harrowmoor family
crest (1,200gp), and 450 tiny platinum coins stamped with
Queen Arda’s dour visage (each worth 5sp).

226

The Remembering Mist

0404

Sloping down eastward. Muddy, 10–20′ high cliffs, festooned with lush ferns and trickling waterfalls.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

The Remembering Mist
Shifting pockets of pale mist hang ominously in this hex.
Avoiding the mist: Characters may navigate around the
pockets of mist, but doing so increases all Travel Point
costs (e.g. to search or leave the hex) by 1.
Memory drain: All characters entering the mist must
make an Intelligence Check. If the check fails, the mist
steals part of the character’s memory away (see Memory
Drain) until they sleep in an inn or settlement. Until then,
while others may try to remind the PC of the lost memory,
it is merely a piece of second hand trivia.
Phantasms: The mist has a rudimentary sentience of sorts,
and savours replaying memories it has absorbed over the
years. Characters may witness ghostly sounds and sights
manifesting in the mist (see Phantasms).

The Shrine to St Willofrith (Hidden)
Amid the mist stands the lost shrine to St Willofrith, slowly
sinking in a boggy dell.
Structure: The shrine consists of four stone pillars (carved
with images of a hand reaching out to a fancy sword) and
a slate roof (now collapsed).
Statue of St Willofrith: Toppled, 5′ tall, carved in black
wood, swollen with damp and covered in moss. The saint
is depicted as a broad-bellied, grinning friar, holding a pie
in his hands.
Prayer: If the shrine is righted, characters praying may
receive the blessing of St Willofrith: the ability to cast
Reveal Alignment. See Shrines, p22.

0405

Lair of the Cheese-Fiend
Dense, gloomy, moss-carpeted woods of birch, yew, and elm. Stagnant puddles abound.

Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Blood-Cheese Sacs
Wanderers in this hex may come across a region where the
skins of various large creatures—including breggles and
humans—hang among the trees.
Inside the skins: The skins are carefully sealed into sacs,
bloated and distended with their strange contents: a
reddish black, cheese-like substance made from blood
rather than milk. The stuff has many forms (slimy, runny,
stringy, hard), but smells and tastes like cheese.
Caretaker: If players spend time investigating the skins,
there is a 2-in-6 chance of the cheese-fiend wandering
nearby, checking the state of the skins.

Giant Hut
In the centre of the cluster of blood-cheese sacs stands a
ramshackle hut of giant proportions (15′ high), cobbled
together from stone, thatch, and branch.
Windows: Small, odd-shaped windows allow a peek inside.
Door: 10′ high, of roughly nailed planks, eminently creaky.
Smell: An acrid stench of strong cheese emanates from the
hut, to a near vomit-inducing potency.

The Cheese-Fiend
A giant woman of obese, lumpy form, 10′ tall, formed
entirely of different kinds of cheese: eyes oozing,
rubbery, bouncy flesh, hairy regions of fuzzy mould,
an oozing Swiss-cheese air-pocket mouth.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Lumbering. Hungry. Views
intruders as potential prey.
Speech: Booming vibrato. Basic, stammering Woldish.
Desires: Driven only by the urge to hunt and gorge
herself on cheese. Treasures real cheese or milk (only
has access to the blood-cheese that she produces).
Large Monstrosity—Semi-Intelligent—Chaotic

Level 9 AC 12 HP 50 Saves D7 R8 H9 B10 S11
Att 2 fists (+7, 2d6) or molten cheese vomit (4d6)
Speed 40 Morale 9 XP 1,350
Immunities: Bludgeoning weapons bounce off the
cheese-fiend’s rubbery flesh, inflicting half damage.
Molten cheese vomit (thrice a day): Affects all characters in a 10′ radius area in front of the fiend’s mouth.
Save Versus Blast for half damage.
Treasure: The creature’s body, if sliced into reasonably
sized portions (ideally without obviously humanoid
characteristics) could be sold to a discerning cheesemonger for up to 2,000gp.

228

Inside the Hut
The hut consists of a single room, unlit.
Inhabitant: There is a 4-in-6 chance of the cheese-fiend
being present in the hut, either dozing or skinning a corpse.
Awful stench: The odour of strong cheese is overwhelming here; characters must Save Versus Doom or suffer a –1
penalty to Attack Rolls for 1d4 Rounds.
Corpses and skins: Dangling from the rafters is a grisly
collection of fresh corpses and drying skins.
Rusty metal tank: In a corner, filled with guts and bones.
Furnishings: A great, oaken worktable and cleavers. A bed
of dried leaves.
Searching: A pouch with eighteen kunzites (100gp each)
lies forgotten in a dark corner. One of the hanging corpses
still wears a copper, knot-work engraved bracelet (200gp)
and matching ring (a Ring of Water Walking—p410).

Fungal Bloom Cave

0406

Humidity permeates these woods. The ground is muddy, the trees mostly rotting.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Cave Entrance

On the gentle slope of a hillside sits a bright patch of white,
fibrous mycelia, about 5′ square, blocking the entrance to
what appears to be a cave. This gate is part of Bloom—the
fungal entity inhabiting the cave’s interior.
Approaching: As adventurers approach, the mycelial patch
emits a hovering cloud of yellowish, fuzzy spores.
Spore cloud: A character who enters the spore cloud is able
to telepathically communicate with the gate (see Speech
in Bloom), which states: “We are Bloom.”
Entering the cave: If good intentions are convincingly
expressed, a portion of the mycelial gate parts, allowing
access. Applying force to the barrier causes Bloom to retaliate.

Inside the Cave
The cave is large and dank, and slopes downward in a staggered series of steps. Ribbed, white mycelia extend to the
cave mouth from deeper in the cavern.
Fungal entity: At the very bottom of the cave lies a multihued fungal growth the size of a small oak tree. In this
growth resides the consciousness of Bloom.
Trapped woman: Swaddled within the fungal mass can be
seen the form of a pale young woman, breathing slowly as
if asleep, mycelial tendrils delving into her flesh.
Touching the woman: She awakens. She is Polldra Duskwith, a Drune Braithmaid. Polldra and Bloom fell in love
and she is in the process of being assimilated into the
fungal entity.
Removing Polldra: Requires 1d6+1 Rounds of cutting—
with Polldra vehemently protesting all the while—and
incurs the wrath of Bloom. Polldra fights and attempts
escape as long as she is with the PCs. Returning her to the
Drune earns a 1,500gp reward for the party.

Polldra Duskwith—Braithmaid
A slight human woman of 21, pale, her long black hair
adorned by variously coloured mushrooms that infest
it. A shrivelled human hand is strung around her neck,
recognisable as a Drune artefact to those familiar with
that faction (a Braithmaid Hand of Glory talisman—
DMB).
Demeanour (Neutral): Serene, content.
Speech: Affectless, deliberate. Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: To remain here forever, in union with Bloom.

Bloom
An extensive agglomeration of endlessly varied colours
and species of fungus. It lies in impressive repose,
ensconced in a soft bioluminescence, swathed in a thick
mist of placidly floating spores.
Demeanour (Neutral): Contemplative, benign.
Speech: Bloom expels spore clouds, which establish a
telepathic link with the inhaler. Woldish.

The Shrine to St Abthius (Hidden)

Desires: To commune blissfully with its love, Polldra.
To absorb organic material to augment its consciousness, particularly snails, slugs, and other gastropods.

A 20′ mound of semi-translucent, purple ooze stands in
an isolated glade, exuding a chill mist. Buried within the
wobbling ooze can be seen the lost shrine to St Abthius, its
wooden structure perfectly preserved by the jelly.

Rewards: If given sufficient organic material, allows
characters to harvest some of its growth: 1d6 doses
chosen randomly from Lambent Stinkhorn, Mottlecap,
Devil’s Grease, or Witch’s Purple. See Rare Fungi, p428.

Extracting the shrine: The ooze can be dug away, but re-coagulates at a frightful rate. A team of six or more people
could extract the shrine in 4 hours. Magical fire burns the
ooze away, but risks damaging the wooden shrine.

Large Fungus—Sentient—Neutral

Prayer: If the shrine is extracted from the ooze, characters
praying may receive the blessing of St Abthius: the ability
to cast Frost Ward. See Shrines, p22.

Droun Loch

A befuddling maze of boulders and crumbling cliffs. Pale owls stare down from quiet, dark pines.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters by the lakeside
are 2-in-6 likely (3-in-6 likely at night) to be with Red
Henry or The Girl With Blue Lips.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Droun Loch
This lonely, forsaken lake, nearly 3 miles across, is circled
by tall hills that often end in abrupt, pine-clad cliffs overlooking the placid waters.
Abnormally quiet: Sound is muted, as if something in the
water is drinking it out of the air.
Drune markings: Many of the surrounding trees are
scratched with owl sigils—markings of Drune presence.
Trapped souls: The dark waters of the Loch seethe with
gaping phantoms, visible just beneath the surface. These
are the souls of those who cast themselves from the cliffs,
called here by insidious dreams promising occult power
in the afterlife. Among the many nameless spirits in the
waters, two notable ghosts haunt the shores: The Girl with
Blue Lips and Red Henry.
Random screams: Adventurers exploring the shores have
a 1-in-6 chance of hearing a disembodied scream, followed
by a profound splash.

At Dawn and Dusk
Adventurers may spot 1d4 Drune cottagers (DMB) in a
rowing boat, skimming the lake surface with glowing nets.
These men are collecting luckless souls to bring back to the
Drune Lodge (hex 0507), where they power the Drune’s
thaumaturgic engine.

The Girl With Blue Lips—Lake Phantom

Red Henry—Lake Phantom

A spectral little human girl who hides amongst the
rocks and brush along the shore, her skin pale and her
lips oxygen-deprivation blue. She is the daughter of a
woodsman who threw himself from the tallest of the
cliffs, many years ago. She tragically drowned while
looking for her father’s body. Now she roams the perimeter of the lake searching for his soul.

The flickering apparition of a haggard human soldier,
with glowing red eyes and skin stretched so tight as to
reveal the outline of his skull. In his mortal life, Henry
was a sadistic mercenary who was summoned here by
the insidious dreams of the Loch.

Demeanour (Lawful): Constant shivering. Terrified of
Red Henry, whom she calls “Red Eyes.”

Speech: Crazed shrieking and cackling. Woldish.

Demeanour (Chaotic): Jittery, brash. Face bears a fixed,
unnatural grin.

Desires: To find her lost father. To make “Red Eyes” go
away. To warm up.

Desires: Blood, mayhem, death. To torment the souls
imprisoned in the lake’s waters. To imprison The Girl
with Blue Lips with them, because her morose presence
is just ruining his fun.

Combat stats: Spectre (DMB) with 6 Hit Points.

Combat stats: Spectre (DMB).

Treasures: A family heirloom necklace (150gp) secreted
near the base of the cliff from which her father leapt.

Treasures: Victims’ remains, hidden in a small cave:
58gp, 2,100sp, a pearl ring (800gp), a flanged Arcane
Mace (Bloodthirsty, p412).

Speech: Meek whining. Woldish.

Guardian Gargoyles

0408

Paths wind among flower-filled dells between steep, bracken-clad hillocks.
Terrain: Hilly forest (3), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

The Sinking Chapel
The green-streaked ruins of an old chapel sit sunken about
3′ in mud at the bottom of a dark glen.
Entering: The door is blocked by the mud, but PCs may
enter through one of the shattered, stained-glass lancet
windows on the chapel’s sides.
Interior: Flooded with 2′ of murky water and boot-sucking
muck. Leafy creepers form bushes in the corners of the
room and climb the walls, and mould abounds. An altar is
barely visible above the flooding.
Inhabitants: Two old gargoyles (DMB), Lucianus and Nicodemus, make their home in the steeple. They immediately
fly down to challenge any visitors. They are servants of the
Church, bound by magic to guard the chapel until the last
brick crumbles to dust. The magic prevents them from
going farther than 100 yards from the chapel.

Nicodemus—Guardian Gargoyle
A gargoyle with a lion’s body and a long neck. His head
is that of a beaked dragon, with a goat’s beard and a
flicking, forked tongue.

Altar: Holds a saintly icon weathered beyond recognition.
The altar has a keyhole in its side that, when unlocked,
causes the altar to slide backwards, revealing a staircase
into The Flooded Crypt.

Demeanour (Lawful): Dutiful, proud. Keeps the
posture of a proper gargoyle at all times.

Trial: The gargoyles cryptically state that they guard this
site for the worthy. If any servants of the Pluritine Church
are in the party, the gargoyles pose a series of questions
relating to the Church in Dolmenwood (see The Gargoyles’
Questions). If characters can successfully answer all of
them, the gargoyles open the altar and grant the party
access to the crypt below.

Desires: To fulfil his duty as a guardian.

Treasure: The gargoyles’ possessions are kept at the top of
the steeple: 1,200sp, a golden Chapes holy symbol (150gp),
and a silver ring with a carnelian setting shaped like a
flower (300gp).

A gargoyle shaped like a spiky-haired dog with a short
wrinkled face and bulging eyes.

Flooded crypt: The crypt is entirely flooded with dark
water. The floor is covered in 4′ of muddy slime. 1d3 Turns
of underwater searching of the muck uncovers an oversized reliquary bust in the likeness of St Sedge. Inside is
the long-lost Helm of St Sedge.

Speech: Eloquent, prone to sprinkling in passages of
scripture. Woldish, Liturgic.
Possessions: The key to the Flooded Crypt is his tongue,
which he can temporarily detach.

Speech: Marble-mouthed, snorting. Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: To be released from his binding.

The Helm of St Sedge

Clewyd dedicated? (St Woad.)
2. Which saint stands beside Follyegg Road as it leaves
Odd? (St Hamfast.)

Vinicus, in hex 0905.)

A helm of silvery-white metal styled to resemble a roaring lion. The tresses of its mane are accented with gold
and its eyes are glittering rubies. Worth 8,000gp.
Commanding power: Once a day, the wearer can cast
Command (p454) on a Chaotic subject.
Compulsive candour: Anyone who dons the helmet
finds themself unable to tell a lie, though they can
remove the helmet at any time.

The Hamlet of Galblight

Scents of onion and garlic. Whorled ash trees sway over a rugged, fern-infested forest floor.
Terrain: Hilly forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Parson’s Gobble (p430), in addition to the normal
results.

The Hamlet of Galblight
The breggle hamlet of Galblight lies upon the old stone
High Road in the south-eastern corner of this hex. The
hamlet is little more than a toll-house and an old inn, with
a few farmhands’ cottages attached.
Inhabitants: 40 shorthorns (DMB—30 unarmed villagers,
10 soldiers), ruled over by Captain Lockehorn, a retainer
of Lord Ramius (p65).
Toll-house: A dilapidated gatehouse straddles the road. In
the daytime, 1d4 shorthorn soldiers demand a toll of 1sp
per traveller and 1gp per wagon. At night the gate is closed.
The Mannish Miser (inn): A former gaol, now converted
into a wayside inn. The sign depicts a sour-faced human
merchant quibbling over coppers with a longhorn knight.
The interior is cramped and low-roofed, with a meagre
fire in the grate. In the evenings, most of the hamlet’s folk
crowd around, cackling and crooning. The establishment is
run by a spirited young shorthorn woman named Harryp,
who is said to be able to drink anyone beneath the table.
Barracks: At the rear of the hamlet, hidden in a copse of
firs, stands a squat, shale-roofed building of dark stone.
Cabruc and her troop of 10 soldiers dwell here in spartan
quarters.
North of the hamlet: Onion, garlic, and turnip fields, and
a vineyard specializing in bitter white grapes. Shorthorn
peasants toil in these farms daily.

Captain Cabruc Lockehorn—Ruler of Galblight
A towering, bearded longhorn (DMB) woman with a
single glowering eye (the other was lost in battle). Wears
pompous military dress uniform and an eyepatch.
A cunning leader and veteran of many military
campaigns. Unwaveringly loyal to Lord Ramius. She is
troubled by her master’s desire to tame and control the
Bicorne, believing Ramius’s plan to be both unachievable and a danger to the region.
Demeanour (Neutral): Considered, taciturn. Leans with
one fist clenched on a table or door frame.
Speech: Curt barking. Woldish, Caprice, Gaffe.
Desires: The return of nighttime serenity to Galblight,
either by the death or pacification of the Bicorne.
Become Ramius’ right-hand woman and live in fancy
rooms in Castle Everdusk.
Possessions: A spiked Arcane Mace (p412) with a haft
of bone.

232

Services at the Mannish Miser
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB). Accommodation is in former gaol cells, complete with barred
windows.
Badgers’ tongues: A local delicacy: badgers’ tongues
pickled in bitter garlic butter. 3sp a serving.
Utterly terrible wine: 3sp per glass.
Stabling and fodder: 2sp per night at the farms, 3sp per
night in a protected courtyard.

At Night
There is a 2-in-6 chance of encountering a hunting party
of 2d4 sleepwalking shorthorns (DMB) in the woods of
this hex or in Galblight (even in lodgings, if PCs stay in
the hamlet).
Sleepwalkers: The somnambulant shorthorns are hunting
for sentient beings to capture and bring to the lair of the
Bicorne (hex 0510), having been roused by the enchanted
whisper of that monstrosity.
Captured sacrifices: Are brought to the Bicorne’s lair to
meet their fate (see hex 0510).

Castle Everdusk

0410

Carefully managed woods rife with the grunting of wild boars. Benches sit at the edges of pretty glades.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Castle Everdusk
Deep in the tangled woods, the stone keep of Castle Everdusk stands atop a steep, bare hill, looming above the palisaded garrison at its feet. It is here that the longhorn nobles
of House Ramius have brooded over the High Wold since
antiquity.
Approaching: An avenue of sighing copper beeches leads
from Capring Road to the iron-studded gates of the garrison. 2d4 shorthorn (DMB) soldiers interrogate would-be
visitors from an adjoining tower.
The garrison: Stone barracks and stables, housing the
army of House Ramius. Drills and pike training take place
in the courtyard, under the command of Braembel and
Hrannid Ramius, Lord Ramius’ sons (longhorns—DMB).
Stairs and gate: A steep stair of white marble, flanked with
banners of House Ramius, leads up the hill to the gates of
the keep.
The keep: Tall and austere, built of ancient stone, girded
with towers and ringed with a stockade of mighty pine
trunks, each branded with the thorned eye emblem of
House Ramius.

Inside the Keep
Oddly proportioned chambers with ill-fitting furnishings,
all thickly clad with tapestries and animal skin rugs. A
preternatural chill pervades, in spite of the cladding, as if
the castle were built of ice, not stone. Only the sumptuous
studies—where Lord Ramius spends his days huddled in
thought before the fire—feel lived in.

Lady Berryld Ramius

Inhabitants: The nobility of House Ramius (longhorns—
DMB), including Lord Ramius (p65), two of his three
sons (Braembel and Hrannid), and two of his four daughters (Lady Berryld and Nannigrew). Lady Berryld, heir of
House Ramius, deals with guests and oversees the shorthorn servants and the running of the keep.

A graceful, 6½’ tall longhorn woman in her thirties,
with ivory horns, unusual pink eyes, and her father’s
snow-white fur. Dresses in gowns of green velvet, with
a silver circlet and cascades of pearls. As heir to House
Ramius, Lady Berryld is scrupulously trained in the
arts of diplomacy and intrigue by her father. Her true
passion lies with the occult, believing herself (in vainer
moments) to be the arcane heir of Hraigl.

Visitors: Are only permitted on official business, and are
kept carefully contained and out of Lord Ramius’ way.
Throne room: A red-carpeted hall on the keep’s upper
floor, its walls lined with archaic polearms. A pair of taxidermied unicorns rear beside the elaborately carved,
thorn-rimmed throne of Lord Ramius. Grand windows
fill the hall with coloured light and present dramatic views
over the High Wold.

Demeanour (Neutral): Arch, haughty, spiteful. Carefully mannered with those of noble stock; disdainful
and curt with those of lower station.

Ancestral crypts: Befuddling, twisting levels of tombs and
dungeons are built into the hill beneath the keep. It is here
that the scions of House Ramius are interred.

Speech: High and warbling, precisely enunciated.
Woldish, Caprice, Gaffe, Old Woldish.

Monument to Hraigl: Among the countless tombs is
an ancient monument dedicated to Hraigl—the fabled
progenitor of the longhorn noble houses. A remarkable
carving in white marble depicts Hraigl atop Wight Falls,
wearing the Horned Crown of the Hydrogyle, about to leap
to her doom (see History, p14). Lady Berryld spends
much of her time here, contemplating the deeds and power
of her ancestor.

Desires: Lore relating to her ancestor Hraigl. To insinuate herself into the trust of her uncle and fellow student
of occult ancestors, Lord Malbleat (p64), in order
to purloin his tomes. To marry anyone but Baron
Hogwarsh (p60).
Combat stats: Longhorn (DMB). Lady Berryld is a magician and can memorise Glyph of Sealing and Shield of
Force.

Ice caverns: A gated stairwell spirals down from the deepest crypt to a series of scintillating ice caverns that have
remained frozen since the reign of the Cold Prince.

0411

Mannog’s Flock
Undulating plains of coarse, knee-deep grass dotted with heather-clad knolls.

Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 1-in-6 likely
(2-in-6 likely at night) to be with 1d3+2 bandits (Level
1 thieves—DMB) and 1d3+2 shorthorns (DMB)—
members of the gang based in hex 0311. Opposing side
has a 3-in-6 chance of being surprised, due to bandits
hiding in the woods.

Farmstead
A quarter mile north of Bove’s Road at the edge of the
woods sit the old, stone buildings of a farmstead: two
barns, some outbuildings, and a large cottage. A thriving
flock of sheep roams the nearby eaves of the forest.
Inhabitants: The farmer Old Mannog Murderman, his 2
shorthorn farmhands (DMB), and his sheep.
Visitors: Are greeted gruffly and offered the opportunity
to purchase Mannog’s garments. He typically has three
garments for sale. See Mannog’s Garments.
Grazing area: Large concealed net traps surround the
sheep’s grazing area. A group approaching the sheep has
a 2-in-6 chance of triggering one; each member must
then Save Versus Hold or be hoisted from the ground
and ensnared. Anyone caught in the trap is manhandled,
imprisoned, and interrogated by Mannog and his farmhands, suspicious of potential sheep thieves.
Cottage interior: A jumbled living space with chunky
woollen rugs, low oak tables, and colourful floor cushions
(no chairs). Creaky doors lead into poky, smoky workshops
for greasing, combing, spinning, and weaving wool.
Bedroom: Mannog keeps his stocks of wool and finished
garments in three great closets in his bedroom. They are
locked and guarded by 3 dolmen pinchers (see Hounds,
DPB) that hide under the bed.

The Flock and Its Wool
Mannog’s sheep are a special breed with long, lustrous
wool, and icy blue, almost human-like eyes. Their diet of
weird woodland fungi lends their wool magical properties.
Magical wool: Garments created from the sheep’s wool
allows the wearer to assume the appearance of another
being (see Mannog’s Garments). No other farmer in the
region can replicate it. Old Mannog sells the garments, but
not the wool or sheep.

Old Mannog Murderman
A hairy human man in his middle years, with burly
arms, a barrel chest, and a frazzled beard down to his
paunch. Wears a sheepskin jacket and a pink felt cap.
Smokes Barley Blend (DPB) in a long, sheep-horn pipe.
Demeanour (Neutral): Rude, cantankerous, shrewd
businessman.
Speech: Wheezing and rumbling. Woldish, basic Gaffe.
Desires: Strong ciders and beers. To grow and protect
his flock. To marry Mother Goat (hex 0312).

234

Mannog’s Garments
A garment transforms the wearer’s appearance to that
of another being, until removed. The effect is visual
only, altering only appearance and garb. Anyone able
to see the invisible can see through the deceit.
Each garment offered for sale is of a random type (1d6)
and appearance/cost (1d6). Garments can also be made
to order for 100gp extra, taking 1d3 weeks.

The Tower of Birds

0412

Wild grassland dotted with isolated farmsteads and the odd ruined fortification.
Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

The Tower of Birds
A tower of dark stone clad with climbing roses stands amid
an expanse of rolling, arable fields. Crows and ravens wheel
about its summit, their cawing drifting on the wind. The
tower is the base of the ancient Order of Warffles.
Wall and gate: A high brick wall, overgrown with ivy,
rings the four acres around the tower. A narrow portcullis,
guarded by 4 shorthorns (DMB), allows entry.
Gardens: The grounds within the wall are beautifully laid
out gardens, burgeoning with aromatic herbs and flowers. Twittering songbirds observe strangers quizzically. A
winding, gravelled path leads to the tower door.
Pond: A family of swans glides across a placid pond at the
rear of the tower.

Inside the Tower
Four storeys of warm, wood-floored passages, drawing
rooms, dining halls, and bedchambers, arranged to a circular layout. Decorated with ancient heraldic tapestries and
antique, embroidered furnishings.
Inhabitants: Commander Fannigrew Lockelope, 3 human
Warffles (Level 3 fighters—DMB) and 5 longhorn Warffles,
and a small staff of shorthorn servants. The atmosphere
is hushed, as the Lady lives in mourning.
Visitors: Politely refused, unless they bring news relating
to High Wold politics or the Bicorne (0510).
The inner garden: An ancient, low door opens to a magical
interior garden—seemingly wider than the tower itself—
wet with dew and lit by a scintillating, golden glow. Ferns,
rambling roses, and honeysuckle thrive here. At the centre
is a 6′ marble statue of a frore gryphus (see 0105)—a longnecked hawk, clad in frost, with its wings spread wide. An
archaic Caprice inscription at the base reads “The Gryphus
serves the tower’s lords as its brethren serve the Prince.”
The statue magically draws birds to the tower.
History: The tower is an ancient fairy stronghold, captured
by the order in the wars with the Cold Prince.

The Order of Warffles
A hereditary military order, based in the Tower of Birds.
The Order is under the notional command of Baron
Hogwarsh (p60), though practically independent.
Originally founded to defend the High Wold against
the armies of the Cold Prince (see History, p14), the
Order is now mainly ceremonial, with the nebulous
mission of “warding High-Hankle’s flank.”

Fannigrew Lockelope (Level 6 Knight)
A longhorn woman in her 30s with a long, slender face,
ebony horns, and dark brown fur streaked with white.
Lockelope is the sole survivor of a disastrous attempt,
several years prior, to capture the monstrous Bicorne
(0510) at the behest of Lord Ramius (p65). She is still
in mourning for her elder sister Hrobe, who was among
those slain by the monster. She remains salty toward
Ramius, but does not blame him.
Demeanour (Lawful): Sombre, distant.
Speech: Reserved, enunciated. Woldish, Caprice, Gaffe.
Desires: The death of the Bicorne. The recovery of her
sister’s remains from its lair, including the locket that
was an heirloom of their Order. Honouring and maintaining the Order’s traditions.
Reward: May grant honorary membership of the Order
of Warffles—including a sash and the right to dwell in
the tower—for the return of her sister’s remains and
the locket. Such honourees must also agree to carry out
occasional missions for the Order.
Knowledge: Detailed information about the Bicorne,
including its lair, treasure hoard, and paralysing breath.
Possessions: A serrated Arcane Longsword (p412). A
ruby pendant (2,000gp). A shining, horned suit of Fairy
Plate Mail (p400).

Insignia: Order members bear a saffron sash embroidered with a frore gryphus (see 0105) akin to the statue
in the tower’s inner garden.
Commander: Minor noble Fannigrew Lockelope
currently holds the title Commander Warffle.

The Bog Hermit

A foul, cloying mist drifts around, rising from stagnant pools. Remnants of ancient walls dot the landscape.
Terrain: Bog (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Downs Road
The ancient road that runs along the ridge of the Table
Downs descends from the slope of the last hill in hex 0601
and disappears without trace in the fens of this hex.

The Sickening Stone
A short monolith of black stone (3′ wide and 5′ tall), patched
with lichen, can be spied amid a copse of twisted, windswept trees.
Entering the copse: The wind goes still and all who enter
must Save Versus Doom or be sickened for the rest of the
day (–1 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws).
Examining the monolith: Beneath the lichen are magical
runes. If deciphered (e.g. with Decipher), the runes reveal
the spell Fear (see Uncommon Spells, p454). An arcane
spell-caster who studies the runes (1 hour) may copy this
spell into a spell book.

The Witch’s Hut
In the south of the hex, close to the eaves of Dolmenwood,
lie the ruins of an ancient settlement, utterly lost to history
and now almost subsumed in the slime and creepers of the
bog. A single, decrepit hut stands amid the ruins, smoke
rising from its tin chimney.
Inhabitants: The witch (DMB) Helligora Ambe lives as a
hermit, along with her lamb familiar, Whipple.
Interior: A clutter of rustic furnishings, fishing nets, and
pungent dried fish. A violet fire burns in the hearth.
Visitors: Those who have travelled the Table Downs are
enthusiastically welcomed, if they agree to tell of what
they have seen there. Others are shunned.

Helligora Ambe (Witch—Eye of Hasturiel)
A tall, frail human woman of youthful mien (seemingly
in her 20s, but actually 45 years old), with straight white
hair to her waist, dull grey eyes, and several teeth missing. Her bones creak as she moves. Dresses in rough
woollens, thickly layered against the cold and damp.
Demeanour (Neutral): Jittery. Terrified of the “Flayed
Queen,” an undead being whose power in the Table
Downs is waxing, or so she believes.
Speech: Cracking, jittery. Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: Information pertaining to the movements of
the Flayed Queen and her undead servants in the Table
Downs (see hex 0701). To unravel the riddle of the ring
and parchment she possesses.
Possessions: Smerne’s Ring (a red soapstone Ring of
Encystment—p410) and Smerne’s Riddle. She knows
that both items are inherited from her ancestor, the
infamous highwayman Dewidort of Smerne (see hex
0607), but does not understand their significance.

Whipple
A young, capering lamb with thick, black wool. It weeps
tears of blood.
Small Animal—Semi-Intelligent—Neutral

Level 1 AC 11 HP 2 Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att None Speed 40 Morale 6 XP 15
Secret name of Hasturiel (once a day): The lamb can
bleat the secret name of Hasturiel, causing beings of
Level 6 or lower within 20′ to flee in terror for 2 Turns
(Save Versus Hold to resist).
If killed: The lamb’s spirit rises as a smoky form, attacking as a spectre (DMB).

236

Smerne’s Riddle
A frayed scrap of parchment with the following riddle:
Margarette, now yours,
My last fortune endures,
The wolf of Smerne wards it.
Locked within willing stone,
As the cleft rock is known,
To the Drune who defend it.
Meaning: The riddle refers to Smerne’s hoard, hidden
using the ring’s magic inside the Willingstone in hex
607. The command word to release the hoard is “Egrydgenn”—the name engraved at the base of the great
wolf statue in the ruined village of Smerne (hex 0301).

Yrthstone and the People of Zarlac

0502

Black-barked firs seem almost aware, quietly glowering at would-be intruders.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Northern Scratch
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.

The People of Zarlac
In a small glade near the centre of the hex stands a cluster
of mud huts.
Inhabitants: 13 humans (10 men and 3 women), as well
as 12 green-skinned children (see Children of Yrthstone),
eke out a precarious living here, subsisting on foraged
nuts and berries and the yields of paltry vegetable patches.
They are an odd mix of folk, but all dress alike, with shaven
heads, white cassocks, and a Z-shaped rune branded on
their foreheads.
Strangers not welcome: The people wish to be left alone
and request that visitors move along. They have no wish to
discuss themselves or matters of the wider world.
Z is for Zarlac: If pressed about the meaning of the rune on
their foreheads, the inhabitants eventually allow that the
Z stands for Zarlac, their master, and that they call themselves the “People of Zarlac.” They cannot resist rhapsodising about Zarlac’s generosity, wisdom, and arcane powers.
History: The people of Zarlac are wanderers who met the
Audrune Zarlac by chance in these woods and accepted
him as their spiritual master. They are now mind-bound
to him through repeated sucklings at his breast. Zarlac
himself resides close by, where he serves as guardian to
the nodal Yrthstone.

The Audrune Zarlac
A rotund human man with a long, thin nose jutting
out from a black cowl. Zarlac welcomes all to sit in Yrthstone’s shadow, if he believes they may be a source of
knowledge. He invites visitors to suckle from his ample
bosom, promising enlightenment (see Milk).
Demeanour (Neutral): Kindly megalomaniac. Overly
cordial for a Drune. Loquacious yet evasive.
Speech: Loud, ebullient. Woldish, Drunic, Sylvan.
Desires: To protect Yrthstone at all costs. To meet
interesting, useful people and make thralls of them.
To conceal his growing community of followers from
the Drune Aegis.
Combat stats: Audrune (DMB).
Milk: Zarlac’s milk is warm and sweet. Those who
partake must Save Versus Spell or become charmed
for the next 4d6 days (per the arcane spell Ingratiate).
Such thralls join “the People of Zarlac,” whom Zarlac
tasks to perform various missions to esoteric ends.
Possessions: An Astrolabe of the Aegis (p420) and two
dead mice with their tails braided together.

The Nodal Yrthstone
In a grove of fir trees adjacent to the hamlet stands a 13′
high slab of white granite; this is Yrthstone, known as the
Teeming Stone.
Guardian: Standing alongside the slab is the Audrune
Zarlac, who greets visitors with an affable bellow.
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Cannibalise (p454). See Ley Lines and Standing Stones,
p18 for details on learning this spell.
Touching the stone: Anyone who touches Yrthstone must
Save Versus Spell or be afflicted with a curse of disintegrating flesh. Each day, a pound of flesh rends away from
the victim’s body. Unless removed by magic (e.g. Remove
Curse), the curse is fatal within 10 days. Dropped chunks of
flesh fester for 1 day before turning green and beginning
to crawl. They make their way towards Yrthstone, where
they gather and grow a new Child of Yrthstone.

Children of Yrthstone
Chunks of flesh that return to Yrthstone gather and
grow into children of broadly human appearance.
Demeanour (Neutral): Quizzical, amoral. Love to
wander the wild woods. Regard themselves as children
of Dolmenwood itself.
Appearance: Green-tinged skin with a thin layer of
bark underneath (+1 AC). Leaves sprout from their joints
during the spring.
Annual pilgrimage: On the 1st of Symswald, Yrthstone’s “offspring” are magically summoned to the
stone from throughout the region to play, sing, and
dance—much to the joy of Zarlac, and the annoyance
and jealousy of Zarlac’s people.

237

0503

Eœl “The Horn”

Chill, mist-filled depressions. Wicked thorn trees, in whose gnarled bark morose faces seem to leer.
Terrain: Thorny forest (4), Dwelmfurgh / Northern Scr.
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 4-in-6 likely
to be with the Audrune Morgodh and 1d6 bramblings
(DMB).
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Rindlewort (p430), in addition to the normal results.

Domain of the Destroyer
All who enter this hex come under the debilitating influence of the Summerstone Eœl and trespass in the domain
of the Audrune Morgodh, fell guardian of the stone.
Debilitating energy: Eœl exudes a powerful debilitating
energy, nauseating all within this hex: –2 penalty to Attack
Rolls and Saving Throws, and spells have a 3-in-6 chance
of failure. The interference with spell-casting makes this
place especially dangerous to the Drune, who only come
here when absolutely necessary.
Morgodh’s wrath: Morgodh is aware of all who enter this
hex, and tracks them down and attacks them without
mercy. (See chance of encounters in this hex.)

Morgodh’s Cottage (Hidden)
This hovel is formed entirely from a dense weave of thorn
bushes, and is barely distinguishable from the briar patch
in which it nestles.
Interior: Sparsely furnished with a rough wicker cot and
two tables covered with an assortment of odd items (worth
up to 100gp if sold to an apothecary): animal skins, dried
mushrooms, rodent organs, and powdered dung.
Cellar: Concealed behind stacks of twisted roots are 200pp,
a pouch of Mogglemoss (DPB—15 smokes), a silver casket
engraved with an elf maiden bathing in moonlight (200gp,
contains 6 portions of Dust of Extinguished Ghosts).

The Summerstone Eœl (Hidden)
The Summerstone Eœl lies at the heart of an especially
tangled and thorny part of the woods. The basalt slab (15′
high, 8′ around) is partly overgrown by the briar bushes
surrounding it. It is known to the Drune as the Horn, due to
its positioning as the northernmost of the warding stones.
(See The Ring of Chell, p20 for full information on the
Summerstones.)
Balmy stillness: The stone is surrounded by a 120-yard
radius of hazy warmth and balmy stillness of the air, reminiscent of the intoxicating days of high summer.
Guardian: The Audrune Morgodh.
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Dispel Magic. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18
for details on learning this spell.
Touching: Anyone who touches Eœl continues to suffer its
effects (see Debilitating energy) for 1d3 days after leaving
this hex. However, if they strike an opponent in combat
during that time, the debilitating effects are transferred
to the opponent.

The Audrune Morgodh
A hulking human man cloaked in black and wreathed in
a sickly purple mist. Known to his fellow Drune as “the
Destroyer,” due to his legendary ruthlessness towards
those who would interfere with Eœl. Morgodh’s
features are inscrutable beneath his black cowl.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Single-minded, bestial fervour.
Speech: Rasping, violent ranting. Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: Actually welcomes trespassers, as he takes
singular joy in dispatching them.
Possessions: A charred Arcane Staff (Impact, p412).
A flame-wreathed Ring of Charming (Humans, p410).
Combat stats: Audrune (DMB) with 48 Hit Points.

238

Dust of Extinguished Ghosts
A semi-transparent, floury powder. Each portion is
worth 4,000gp.
Throwing: A portion forms a 10′ cloud when thrown
in the air. Everything it coats is rendered visible for
2d10 Turns, negating magic of invisibility, camouflage,
displacement, and mirror imaging.

The Falls of Naon and the Embassy

0504

The falls can be heard throughout this hex. Cool spray and mist can be felt up to a mile distant.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

The Falls of Naon
The river Hameth plummets over a stony cliff, 200′ high,
and crashes down upon the rocks below in a booming
cacophony.

The Top of the Falls
The waters of the Hameth narrow, accelerate, and plummet
over the falls.
Slippery: The banks of the river and the summit of the falls
are slick with mud and spray. Anyone moving carelessly
(e.g. in melee) must make a Dexterity Check once every 2
Rounds or fall.
Steps: A stairway, carved into the rock, winds down the cliff
face on the western side of the falls to the wooded slopes
at the base. The steps are slippery, as above.
Secret door: Half way down the steps, a platform and an
open door—both concealed by fairy glamours—lead into
a series of hidden caverns. Those who can detect magic or
the invisible perceive the secret entrance.

The Embassy in the Hidden Caverns
A small retinue of frost elves lives in isolation in the secret
caverns behind the torrent of the falls. By ancient, uncircumventable decree, the Cold Prince’s embassy to mortal
folk was excluded from the ban of Chell (see The Ring of
Chell, p20). It thus remains in the mortal world as the
only foothold of the frost elves within Dolmenwood.
Ice caverns: Several hundred yards of winding tunnels
and icicle-clad grottoes, all lit with a lambent blue light of
unknown origin.
The door to the embassy: A 12′ high, arched gate of polished
black fairy wood. Pillars on each side are carved in the form
of trees whose branches meet and intertwine above the
door. The door is locked by magic, but knocking summons
a butler.
Reception: No guest has visited the embassy for centuries.
The inhabitants are so bored that they welcome anyone
who knocks on their door, giving them the full royal treatment.
The embassy: A series of baroquely appointed reception
rooms, legal libraries, and guest suites, arranged around
a central banquet hall decked with taxidermied unicorns’
heads.
Inhabitants: The frost elf Ambassador (p50) presides
over the embassy, treating with any and all visitors. His
staff includes six ambassadorial aides, three chefs, three
butlers, and four maids.

Activities: The elves await the return of their lord, the Cold
Prince, and have maintained the necessary functions of
an embassy. Utterly isolated for nigh on nine centuries,
however, they have all but forgotten their duty, and now
spend their days in endless feasting, listless debates on
obscure points of law, theoretical heraldry centred on
the hypothesised kings of the seas, baking emotions into
pastries, and so on.
Atmosphere: A melancholic air of faded nobility, now
devolved into decadence, pervades the embassy. The
Ambassador and his retinue grow desperate, as their stocks
of fairy victuals, once considered virtually without limit,
are dwindling. With the last of their fairy foods and wines,
the elves fear the touch of the mortal world will turn them
to dust.
Treasures: The embassy contains a fortune of rich, antique
furnishings. The vast (and magical, to mortal sense) pantry,
though its stocks are greatly diminished, is store to great
prizes, such as wines from mortal cultures long forgotten.

The Base of the Falls
1d3 Drune cottagers (DMB) watch from a hidden vantage
point on the wooded slopes beside the falls. They fight
without quarter if attacked or if adventurers appear to be
assisting frost elves in escape.
Duty: The Drune carefully guard this site, ensuring that no
frost elf may come or go. Attempts to leave the embassy
have occurred in the past, but have always been prevented.
Reaction to strangers: Typically aloof and enigmatic. They
view any kind of fairy in this vicinity with great suspicion.
Treasures: The Drune watchmen share a Lens of Penetration (p404).

Hoarblight Keep and the Isle of Yeth

High grounds beside the lake, clad with misty pine woods. The air here is motionless and chill.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Goatsweed (p430), in addition to the normal results.

Hoarblight Keep
High upon an outcropping of stone, a fearsome castle
surveys the waters of Longmere.
Cliffs: Sheer chalk cliffs, 150′ high, riddled with lichens and
patches of sickly violet fungus.
Stairway: A stair is carved into the cliff side, winding its
way up from the banks of Longmere to the woods before
the outer walls of the keep.
Outer walls: The extent of the keep’s grounds is bounded
by a sturdy brick wall, overgrown with ivy. Many gates
and secret doors pierce the wall; most are warded with
tricksome fairy magic.

Hairbats

Gardens: Within the wall, one finds a fantastic and vast
array of gardens, hedge mazes, follies, grottoes, lodges,
and plazas. Many of these places are haunted with strange
presences that have lingered since ages long past.

Giant bats with 3′ wingspans, ugly, snarling visages, and
great, floppy mops of green or orange hair upon their
heads. They are harmless if left alone.

The keep: Clad in shimmering frost, centuries old, but
pristine as the first snow of winter. The contents of the keep
are beyond the scope of this book, but may be elaborated
in a future publication (or by the Referee).

Level 1 AC 13 HP 1d8 (4) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att Bite (+0, 1d3) Fly 60 Morale 6 XP 10

History: The keep was the seat of the Cold Prince’s dominion in Dolmenwood, whence he ruled for centuries
unknown, before the coming of mortal folk to the Wood.
Lingering fairy magic: Though the Cold Prince and his
allies are banished from Dolmenwood, some of his magic
lingers in Hoarblight Keep and its grounds.

The Isle of Yeth
The cliff-sided Isle of Yeth bisects the lake here for nigh 3
miles.
Cliffs: The steep, chalky, guano-streaked cliffs rise to a
height of 200′ above the waters of the lake.
Caves in the cliffs: The sides of the cliffs are riddled
with delvings, some leading to caves of substantial size.
Hundreds of hairbats roost here.
Atop the isle: Dense and utterly untamed forest, without
path or glade. Few animals live here, but bats and birds
are numerous.

The Ruined Tower
At the northern tip of the Isle of Yeth, a wide, square tower
pierces the canopy of the woods.
Empty shell: Even when viewed from the shore, it is obvious that the tower is little more than a shell.
At night: An eerie, green glow hangs above the tower.

240

Small Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral

On Windswept Nights
The distant raging of the Falls of Naon (hex 0504) and the
keening of the air stimulate the manifestation of the Locus
of Ertta the Devouring Mother (see Witches, p72).
The Locus of Ertta: Manifests as a 30-yard-diameter, misty
green glow wavering above the summit of the ruined
tower.
Witches: When the locus is manifest, 2d6 witches—eyes
of Ertta (DMB) fly to the locus and gather in the green glow
above the tower. They stand in mid air, as if the luminescence is solidified, and conduct their rites of communion
with the Gwyrigon who has dominion over age, death,
and decay.

The Stone of Repentance

0506

Lonely pine woods punctuated with granite outcroppings. A moaning wind pervades.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

The Moaning Sphere
An area of flat, windswept marsh 100 yards wide separates Lake Longmere from the woods. At the centre of this
sedge-dotted strand is a 10′ sphere of granite.
Moaning wind: The sphere is the source of the moaning
wind that pervades this hex. It reaches near-maddening
intensity as one approaches the stone.
Runes: The sphere is carved with a runic inscription identical to that found on the Summerstones (see The Ring of
Chell, p20.)
False Summerstone: The Drune placed this stone here as
a distraction for those who might seek out Drodh.
Destroying the sphere: Can be accomplished by powerful magic (e.g. Disintegrate). Should this occur, the moaning wind reaches a shattering crescendo and an illusory
procession of frost elf knights appears at the lake shore.
The knights march solemnly into the woods, brandishing
banners and unearthly weapons while falsely proclaiming
the return of the Cold Prince in icy, malevolent voices. The
following day, the sphere returns to its place, unscathed.

The Summerstone Drodh (Hidden)
A ring of trilithons stands in a clearing atop a 40′ high crag.
At the centre of the ring is the 15′ high stone of black basalt
called Drodh, the Stone of Repentance. (See The Ring of
Chell, p20 for full information on the Summerstones.)

The Audrune Rigmirth
Rigmirth exists in an occult symbiosis with the stones
of this glade, his skin and organs stretched across the
megaliths around Drodh. If intruders enter the circle,
Rigmirth can rip the stones out of the ground, becoming a gargantuan construct, 15′ tall, of stretched skin
and rune-bound stone.

Balmy stillness: The stone is surrounded by a 120-yard
radius of hazy warmth and balmy stillness of the air, reminiscent of the intoxicating days of high summer.
Fleshy covering: The stones encircling the Summerstone
are covered with a thin layer of pustules and gore. This is
the physical form of the Audrune Rigmirth, the guardian
of Drodh.
Entering the ring of stones: Awakens Rigmirth.
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes upon Drodh describe the
arcane spell Hex Weaving. See Ley Lines and Standing
Stones, p18 for details on learning this spell.
Viewing Drodh: Anyone who sets eyes upon the Summerstone must Save Versus Spell. If the save fails, upon leaving
the area the character has no memory of what occurred
there or of having ever seen the place.

Drune Lodge
Calcified, skull-like rock formations. Dripping, moss-clad cliffs descend eastward in tiers.

Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

The Veiled Wood
This hex is woven with the deepest of Drune magic, warping the fabric of reality itself. The Referee should secretly
roll a Save Versus Spell for all non-Drunes entering this
hex. If any in a party fail, all are unwittingly transported
to the next hex in their direction of travel, continuing
their journey there.

Doors to Drune Lodge
The northern banks of Skull Creek are dotted with mighty,
black-barked pines with trunks 15′ thick.
Concealed doors: Each great pine has an arched door at
its base, concealed by illusion and visible only to Drunes.
Entering: Those who can perceive a door and bypass its
Glyph of Locking (Level 5 caster) find a timeworn wooden
stairway spiralling down into the Drune Lodge.

Within Drune Lodge
Chilly, subterranean halls of stone, lit by green flames
flickering in the suspended skulls of stags and great owls,
echoing with the distant howl of the thaumaturgic engine.
Doors of black oak ward cramped living quarters, larders,
and kitchens. Pillared galleries overlook gloomy studies
and ritual chambers. Stairways and corridors wind and
sweep, bewildering those not familiar with their paths.
Inhabitants: 15 Aegis members (treat as Drune cottagers,
DMB), 18 archivists, scribes, and assistants (Drune cottagers, DMB), 22 Drunewives (DMB), 24 children (including
8 Braithmaids, DMB), 5 charmed servants, and the Elder
Phanatarch (p55).
Intruders: Are exterminated. 12 giant stone owls (as
gargoyles—DMB) animate to see off intruders.
The Aegis hall: A vaulted hall of polished, russet wood,
ringed with owl-carved benches, where the Drune council
assembles. At one side sits the austere granite throne of the
Elder Phanatarch, flanked by two great bells—one of iron
and one of silver—rung to pronounce judgement or doom.
Library and vaults: Winding caverns, lined with towering
bookshelves containing the sum of Drune lore (including
all arcane spells). Sigil-warded vaults hold coins and jewels
(worth 50,000gp), potions, scrolls, and all manner of magical artefacts, including a Staff of Cancellation (p416), a Staff
of Wizardry (p416), and a Helm of Teleportation (p406).
The thaumaturgic engine: A domed chamber housing
a hovering, 20′ wide sphere of utter blackness, wreathed
in blue lightning and emitting a horrid howl as it slowly
rotates. The engine, fed by souls dredged from Droun Loch
(0407), maintains the enchantments that veil Drune Lodge.

242

Ossuary: The bones of all deceased Drunes—etched with
the summation of each individual’s deeds and the names
of their forebears—are interred within niches in the vast,
labyrinthine ossuary.
Audrune crypts: The bodies of the Audrunes Grebglin,
Haygral, and Mestmord lie in stasis in hidden ossuary
crypts. Each is interred with a Talisman of Protection From
Scrying (p398) and guarded by 3 shadows (DMB).
Palace of the Phanatarch: Deep below the ossuary, the
Elder Phanatarch (p55) dwells in pillared halls of sepulchral black marble. All furnishings are of bone, owl-feather,
and wolf-fur. The Phanatarch spends his days poring over
old tomes, scrying in a Crystal Ball (p404), or consulting
with Auldweathe—the spirits of 9 Braithmaids who in the
ancient days of Drunedom sacrificed themselves to serve
their king eternally (as spectres, DMB). If threatened, the
Phanatarch can summon 12 shadows (DMB).

The Skeletal Gardener

0508

Tiers of rugged cliffs, sloping steeply to the east. Moss and mould thrive in dank, lightless recesses.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Fungal Organs
Skull Creek, where it winds through this hex, cascades
through a series of gurgling pools and falls. The slick rock
faces beside these pools are home to a rare species of scarlet fungus named Numblings (p428), bearing an eerie
resemblance to various organs of the human body—fungal
mockeries of brains, hearts, eyeballs, tongues, lungs,
fingers, and noses may all be found here.
Skeletal warden: While these odd mushrooms are naturally occurring, their profusion here is due to the care
and attention of their warden—Colly, a sentient skeleton
(DMB) who spends her ageless life tending these fungal
miracles.

Colly—Sentient Skeleton
A 5′4″ tall female human skeleton in pristine, gleaming
white condition, her forehead subtly engraved with
magical runes.
Demeanour (Neutral): Single-minded. Happy to
converse with those who approach her in peace.
Speech: Whistling between the teeth. Woldish.
Desires: To care for and nurture this unique mycological paradise, and to prevent anyone from tampering
with it, especially eating of it.
Knowledge: Does not remember how she was created
or who tasked her with the protection of the garden, but
has vague memories of once living in a grand manor
to the south.

The Ruined Manse (Hidden)
Deep in a ravine overgrown with tangled hawthorn stands
the ruin of a once-grand manse, now reduced to roofless
heaps of tumbled stone and rotted beams.
Searching: The symbol of a serpent writhing through
the mouth and eye sockets of a human skull (the sigil of
the manse’s former owner) appears on a number of fallen
keystones.
Sealed door: A single door of iridescent black wood stands
intact in its arch amid the ruins, leading to nowhere. The
door is sealed with a Glyph of Locking (Level 9 caster). If
opened, a secret, extra-dimensional laboratory is revealed.
The extra-dimensional laboratory: A 20′ square chamber of chill, white marble. The central area is sequestered
with white drapes, concealing the grossly swollen (but
still fresh) corpse of a raven-haired woman laid upon a
solid steel, rune-etched slab. Bone-trimmed cupboards by
the walls contain hundreds of embalmed organs in jars,

knives and saws of all sizes, a collection of treatises on
necromancy (2,000gp), a set of five Skeleton Keys (p420),
arcane scrolls of Arcane Eye and Animate Dead, a crystal
flask of Essence of Springtime (p414).
History: Many centuries ago, the necromancer Leelandra Umberwold dwelt in the manse with her two sons
and dozens of undead servitors (including Colly—the
last remaining). The body in the laboratory is her failed
attempt at cloning herself to escape death.

The Pelloryons
Balmy clearings of towering sunflowers and dazzling poppies. Summer reigns year round.

Terrain: Hilly forest (3), High Wold / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line crossing Chell/Ywyr: Arcane spell-casters
perceive the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and
biting cold. (See p20.) The energies of the Ywyr are
siphoned into Chell at this nexus, so visitors feel no
additional effects from its presence.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Woods of Perpetual Summer
The arcane energies of the nodal known as the Pelloryons,
which lies at the centre of this hex, keep the surrounding
woods trapped in nigh-perpetual summer.
Distracting drone: Bees buzz here, often and loudly, with
a slow, almost hypnotic drone.

The Warding Maze
From the safety of a hidden fastness among the roots
of the woods, the Pelloryons’ guardian, the Audrune
Cadraigaunt, oversees and maintains a series of wards to
confound wanderers and destroy intruders.
Common travellers: Walk about three miles into the hex
before realizing they have ended up back at whatever edge
they entered from.
Those who seek the Pelloryons: Feel the woods slowly
closing in on them, eventually transforming into a twilit,
phantasmagoric labyrinth haunted by gibbering spirits
and mocking, human-faced trees. Characters must Save
Versus Spell. Should all in the party succeed, the labyrinth vanishes; otherwise, the interlopers are attacked by
3 invisible stalkers (per the arcane spell—DPB). The maze
evaporates if the stalkers are defeated.

The Pelloryons
Beyond all the wards, in a glade nestled between hills at
the hex’s centre, stand the Pelloryons (the “three sisters”).
They comprise the most crucial node of the warding ring.
Guardian: Should intruders reach this point, the Audrune
Cadraigaunt immediately arrives to dispatch them.
Appearance: The Pelloryons consists of three towering
pillars of chalky limestone, approximately 10′ around
and 18′ in height. Each is carved with figures representing
members of the Triple Compact (p17), as follows.
King stone: Carved on one side to resemble an ancient king
and on its reverse to resemble a crone holding a chalice.
Friar stone: Engraved on one side with a gaunt friar holding a flaming Chapes holy symbol, and on the other with a
screaming elfin form locked in eternal torment.
Drune stone: Carved in the crude likeness of a Drune’s
hood, while on its reverse is the sculpted form of the stagheaded Wood God Howawi (p38).

244

Inscribed spell: Drunic runes around the stones’ base
describe the arcane spell Invisible Stalker. See Ley Lines and
Standing Stones, p18 for details on learning this spell.
Touching the stones: The stones’ surfaces are warm and
balmy to the touch, while the areas around the figures’ eyes
and mouths are unearthly cold.
Destroying the stones: Toppling them by brute force
brings about the disastrous consequences detailed under
The Ring of Chell, p20.

The Audrune Cadraigaunt
An ancient, hunchbacked Audrune who has guarded
the Pelloryons for nigh five centuries, clinging to life by
sheer force of purpose. An eye-like flame burns beneath
his cowl and bees flit menacingly around him.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Ruthless, joyless, single-minded,
gleeful in hunting and destroying those who trespass
on his lands. The cruellest of the Drune.
Speech: A sinister rasp, underpinned by the eerie buzzing of insects. Woldish, Old Woldish, Drunic, Liturgic.
Desires: Above all, to maintain the secrecy of the Pelloryons. To wrest the soul of his friend Hemlack (former
guardian of Sargstone) from the clutches of Atanuwë
(see hex 0904).
Combat stats: Audrune (DMB) with the ability to cast
additional spells: Dweomerlight, Polymorph, Dweomerfire, Geas, Word of Doom.
Insect swarm: Cadraigaunt’s symbiotic insect swarm
(DMB) of bees and stinging insects can attack foes.
Staff of Mellification: Cadraigaunt wields a gnarled
staff oozing with honey. A victim hit must Save Versus
Doom (with a +2 bonus) or collapse into an oozing,
honey-filled husk. The staff is worth 35,000gp.

The Lair of the Bicorne

0510

Rugged, broken ground choked with brambles and smashed trunks. Ruined buildings collapsed into ditches.
Terrain: Hilly forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Pit
Near the north-west corner of the hex is a redwood tree
that appears to have been ripped from the earth by giant
hands. Beneath it is a great deep pit that reeks of blood and
carrion. Within the pit lairs an ancient monster known as
the Bicorne, stirring from its fitful dreams of late.
Descending the pit: The pit itself is sheer-sided and 70′
deep. Each character entering the pit has a 1-in-6 chance
of waking the Bicorne.
Mushrooms: The base of the pit is carpeted with Speckled
Sporange and Purple Nightcap mushrooms (see Rare Fungi,
p428). 2d20 decent specimens of each can be gathered.
The Bicorne’s lair: At one side, a rough, 50′ long chamber is
burrowed out, most of which is filled with old bones. The
Bicorne lies in this chamber in a nearly dormant state,
belching forth contagion and nightmares.
Treasure hoard: Buried among the bones and detritus
of the lair are 5,676gp, 6,332sp, 10,099cp, a set of three
mouldy spell books (half of the spells are still readable:
Rank 1 Floating Disc, Glyph of Sealing, Rank 2 Mind Crystal,
Rank 3 Haste), a shiny silver Holy Shield (p400), somewhat dented, engraved with narwhals (the wielder gains
the ability to speak with whales), a bronze casket studded
with citrine (1,500gp), a silver locket with a portrait of a
longhorn noblewoman wearing a saffron sash (1,000gp—
belonged to the sister of Commander Lockelope, p235).

At Night
There is a 2-in-6 chance of encountering a hunting party
of 2d4 sleepwalking shorthorns (DMB) in the woods of
this hex.
Sleepwalkers: The somnambulant shorthorns are hunting for sentient beings to capture and bring to the lair of
the Bicorne, having been summoned from Galblight (hex
409) by the monster’s enchanted whisper.
Captured sacrifices: Are tossed into the Bicorne’s pit,
where the beast shreds them in psychic agony.

The Bicorne
A beast of fey origin with the body of a bull, the legs of
a boar, and a head that combines the worst aspects of
both into a tusked and horned monstrosity.

The Inn of the Tankards
Steep-sided, flat-headed hills, many topped with fluttering banners of House Ramius.

Terrain: Hills (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

The Inn of the Tankards
At the oft-trodden junction near the hex’s centre stands an
inn, its lower floor entirely obscured by old growth trees.
Sign: A breggle arm crossing a human arm, each holding
a frothing tankard.
Common room: Large and busy, the cacophony of patrons’
voices verging on harsh. Conspicuously clean, all walls
freshly painted, all wooden surfaces polished to a bright
sheen. The inn is owned by a shorthorn couple: Crump
Elbowgen frenetically serves patrons, while his wife Nelga
alternates between poring over a ledger and roaming the
grounds compulsively in search of maintenance tasks.
Negative atmosphere: All Reaction Rolls suffer a –1 penalty
in the inn. PCs may witness a random and upsetting
mishap in the common room (argument turned knife
fight, horrific gambling loss, vicious lovers’ quarrel, etc.)
Afterwards, holy spell-casters feel nauseous.
Guests: Shorthorn and human merchants. Casual conversation reveals that the inn changes hands frequently. The
Elbowgens have owned it for two years; the previous owner
drowned in a nearby well in an apparent drunken mishap.

Services at the Inn of the Tankards
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB).
Elder tea: Served in fine porcelain. 1gp per serving.

Crump Elbowgen—Shorthorn Landlord
Brown fur with black patches, in a crisply pressed waistcoat. Crump can feel his wife is not entirely present.
Demeanour (Lawful): Nervous, wary, eager to please.
Speech: Staccato rambling. Woldish, Gaffe.

At Night
Haunting: While in bed, 1 random party member experiences an event from the Hauntings table.
Sleepwalker: Watchful PCs may observe Nelga moving in
a trance-like state to the basement, where she enters a door
hidden behind a wine rack, passing into a secret chamber.
The secret chamber: A damp, vaulted brick chamber.
Scattered about are sheet after sheet of drawings, clearly
created by different artists over many years, all depicting
the inn in various forms, often with a sinister face.
Observing Nelga: She crouches on the floor and manically
sketches by candlelight, all the while muttering threats
and pleading for mercy in different voices. She continues
for an hour, then departs, still in a trance.

Nelga Elbowgen—Shorthorn Landlady

Interrupting Nelga: The house causes a torrent of bricks
to fall onto the PCs (Save Versus Hold or take 1d4 damage).
In the confusion, Nelga flees and returns to her room. The
next day, she has no recollection of these events.

White fur and a calico dress. She talks of nothing but
the inn, in language that personifies it.

The Inn’s Secret Nature

Desires: To understand his wife’s state. To sell the inn.

d6 Event

History: Centuries ago, the inn was unwittingly built
with wood felled in an accursed glade. It is now a sentient,
malevolent entity that instigates and feeds on terror, strife,
sorrow, and murder. It delights in slowly destroying its
proprietors and causing their untimely end. Each time
it changes hands, an owner (currently Nelga) gradually
becomes obsessed with the inn, soon treating it as if it
were alive.

Exorcising: Using magic of curse removal or successfully
turning undead against a Level 5 monster in the secret
chamber causes foetid, black water to burst from the walls,
and a mournful, plangent wail. The inn’s evil nature is
purged, leaving the inn heavily damaged and its owners
bewildered but relieved.

Demeanour (Neutral): Quiet yet forceful.
Speech: Direct, then trailing off. Woldish, Gaffe.
Desires: To keep the inn utterly, painfully clean.

Hauntings

246

Spectral blood dripping from walls.
Oppressive sensation of being watched.
Corpse-like female elfish visage in window.
Bed levitates to the sound of mocking laughter.
Disembodied moaning under the bed, in closets, etc.
Window opens and slams shut multiple times.

High-Hankle and the Wayward Griffons 0512
Ancient, tilled land, awash with the sounds of chittering hedgerow birds, clopping hooves, and lowing cattle.
Terrain: Farmland (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 1d4 knights (Level 1 knights—DMB) and 1d4
griffon trainers equipped with caged wagons, huge
nets, and braces of hares, attempting to capture the
wayward griffons established on Monk’s Hill.

The Town of High-Hankle
High-Hankle, sprawling capital of the High Wold, sits in
the south of the hex, amid a patchwork of fields, farms,
and thorps.
Town walls: A hulking sandstone wall girds the inner town.
Castle Perigonne: A dizzyingly tall tower that looms at the
centre of the town. This is the home of Baron Hogwarsh
(p60), ruler of the High Wold.
Town of hedonism: Under the lax rule of the current Baron
Hogwarsh, High-Hankle has developed a reputation for
revelry, carousing, and debauchery of all kinds.
Full settlement description: See p150.

Monk’s Hill and the Ruined Tower
A broad hill stands in the north of the hex, overlooking
Tankards Road. Its summit and sides are clad with dense
woodland, wild and untouched save by the locals who
venture there to collect firewood. A ruined tower stands
atop the hill, lost amid the tangled wood.
Griffons: Travellers sight 1d3 griffons wheeling in the air
above the hill and gliding over the surrounding farmland, observing livestock below. These creatures recently
escaped from the Griffonry in High-Hankle and are lairing
in the upper floors of the ruined tower at the hill’s summit.
They are a source of terror and aggravation for the farmers
whose herds they prey upon.

Capture: Sir Waverly (p152) pays 1,500gp for each griffon
safely returned to the Griffonry in High-Hankle.
Tower ground floor: Relatively intact, with a solid oaken
door hanging off its hinges. Shrubs, mosses, and creepers have colonised the dank interior. A faint purple glow
emanates from a circular shaft in the floor, leading 20′
down to the Accursed Grotto. A stone stair winds up to the
upper floors.
Tower upper floors: Partially collapsed, overgrown with
ivy. The 3 griffons have begun to establish a nest, pushing
out errant rubble and mounding up branches and straw.
Bones and carcasses of sheep are scattered around.

The Accursed Grotto
The shaft from the surface ends in a small cave, which
opens into a larger subterranean grotto. At the centre of
the grotto sits a dark, 10′-deep pool that emits a slowly
pulsing, purple glow. Salt-crusted stalactites ring the cave
walls, some of which are carved into the likeness of great,
grimacing oxen with a blood-like liquid dripping from
their mouths.
Examining the pool: A 4′-high, tarnished metal statue of
a man in bishop’s robes can be spied at the bottom of the
pool. The statue—depicting St Howarth—is solid silver,
worth 1,500gp.
Touching the water: Save Versus Doom or be overcome
with blood-lust, ruthlessly attacking allies for 1d6 Turns.
Touching the “blood”: Save Versus Hold or transform into
an ox over the course of 2d6 days. The character can be
returned to their normal form by magic of curse removal.
History: Long ago, this was a sacred healing pool associated with St Howarth, who once bathed here. Following Howarth’s fall (p68), the pool and grotto became
accursed.

The Lonely Grave
Dotted with ancient earth-workings: mounds, ridges, and rings.

Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Moaning Wind
As characters travel along the bleak ridge of the Table
Downs, the moaning of the wind takes on a voice-like quality, as if carrying shouted warnings from afar.
If PCs stop to listen: They catch the name of the character
with the highest Wisdom in the erratic, ominous wailing.

The Lonely Grave
A simple, weatherworn headstone is visible beneath the
eaves of a serene copse at the base of a hill.
Inscription: The name of the PC with the highest Wisdom
is inexplicably carved onto the gravestone, along with the
epitaph “Lord of the Wild.”
Examining: The stone appears to be many centuries old.
The ground around is overgrown and undisturbed.
Unearthing: A decaying coffin is buried 3′ down. Inside
is a skeleton of the same physical proportions as the PC
whose name the headstone bears. Its skull is smashed in.
Two objects lie on its breast (see Grave Treasures).
Cursed: If the skeleton or the objects are taken from
this place, the PC whose name is engraved on the headstone comes under a curse. The next time they sleep in a
house or inn, they experience a nightmare wherein they
are attacked by a spectre (DMB) whispering “Lord of the
Wild.” The PC may use their normal equipment, spells,
etc. to fight the monster, but it is immune to turning. If
the PC vanquishes the spectre, they awake unharmed and
without any spells or equipment expended. If the PC is
defeated, their companions discover them in the morning,
dead, with their head smashed in.

248

Grave Treasures
Silver knife: Engraved with Liturgic script only visible
in moonlight. The script read “For the glory of God.” The
knife is actually a Holy Longsword (Shrinking, p412). The
Liturgic inscription, if uttered by a Lawful character, causes
the blade to grow or shrink.
Brass ring: Inscribed with very fine lines in the shape of
frost patterns. It is a Ring of Energy Resistance (Cold, p410)
of fairy make. A mortal who possesses it also comes under
a glamour causing them to giggle ominously in their sleep,
disturbing the rest of any nearby.

The Hall of the Fomorian

0602

Looming fir trees, surrounded with a weird, pink luminescence. Jagged, mutant cones litter the ground.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 Shub Eggs
(p430), in addition to the normal results.

Massive Platform and Domed Hall
At the very bottom of a steep, fir-wooded dingle, a 30′ high
wall looms abruptly into view. Composed of gargantuan
marble flagstones smoothed to a mirror-like lustre, it
proves to be the side of a 500′ square massive stone platform. A stairwell on each side leads to the top.
Platform top: A bare, cracked expanse, its monotony
broken only by small tussocks of grass, occasional flocks
of birds, and a structure at its very centre: the Domed Hall.
Domed hall: A purple-veined half-bubble of stone, 30′ tall
and 80′ in diameter. A pyramid of scarlet glass sits at its
peak. On its eastern face lies an arched doorway.

Inside the Domed Hall
A dry, musty, cavernous space, barely illuminated by
reddish light filtered through the glass pyramid above. A
mass of broken statuary draped with ancient, mouldering
rugs fills much of the room. Atop this heap sits the Scrying Globe, a giant figure—the Fomorian—leaning over it,
peering into it with concentration.

The Fomorian
A blue-skinned giant standing roughly 15′ tall, wearing a grey wool tunic, bracers of black metal, and a
thick belt of cracked brown leather. A grim helm of
raw black iron partially covers a beard of pale, fingerthick earthworms that wriggle constantly. The helmet’s
visor covers a writhing, black smudge in place of eyes
(see Gaze). The Fomorian is a guardian placed here by
the fairy trickster Lord Gladhand (p34) to toy with
mortals wishing to enter the Emerald Door.
Demeanour (Neutral): Solemn, placid, mournful.
Speech: Slow, calm, deep boom. Woldish, Old Woldish,
Sylvan, High Elfish.
Desires: To be relieved of his vigil by the (imaginary)
“Jack-the-Emerald-Cloaked.”
Large Monstrosity—Sentient—Neutral

Level 16 AC 15 HP 64 Saves D2 R3 H4 B5 S6
Att 2 fists (+11, 2d6) or gaze (glassify) Speed 60
Morale 11 XP 4,250
Immunities: Only harmed by magic or magic weapons.
Gaze: The Fomorian may raise his visor and cast his
baleful gaze upon a target within 100′. The target
must Save Versus Hold or be transformed into green
glass. The victim returns to normal if the Fomorian is
defeated or departs.

Addressing the Fomorian: The being breaks its reverie and
asks the adventurers their business. If addressed respectfully, the Fomorian states that he is an immortal from the
“World Below,” sent here by the “Powers” to await “Jackthe-Emerald-Cloaked,” who will be invested with custody
of the all-powerful globe.
The Scrying Globe: A great, glowing orb. The Fomorian
forbids any to approach the globe, resorting to deadly
force should PCs persist. Should a character peer into the
globe—after satisfying, defeating, or otherwise evading
the Fomorian—they perceive the Emerald Door within.
The arrival of Jack: A character need only don an emerald
green cloak and announce that they are “Jack-the-Emerald-Cloaked” to satisfy the Fomorian of Jack’s arrival. The
Fomorian then grins slyly, bows, and disappears.

The Emerald Door
Visible within the Scrying Globe guarded by the Fomorian
is a door of scintillating emerald, surrounded by dense,
bluish mist.
Touching the globe: Whisks one away to the fairy road
Buttercup Lane (see Fairy Roads, p26).
Exiting through the door: Characters exiting Buttercup
Lane in this hex appear outside the domed hall atop the
massive platform.

If slain: The Fomorian melts away into nothingness.

0603

The Ruined Cottage

Choked with thickets of brittle, barbed bushes. The wind whistles with almost voice-like susurrations.
Terrain: Thorny forest (4), Dwelmfurgh / Northern Scr.
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Charred Cottage
Beside a sluggishly flowing stream, in a clearing ringed
by ancient and rotting firs, sit the charred remains of a
cottage. Its burnt timbers lie scattered within the roughly
square frame of its foundation stones. Tall grasses now
occupy its dirt floors, swaying in a gentle breeze.
At night: Voices murmur near the ruin, muffled and frantic
as if in heated debate. This is the sound of 1d3+1 muttering
phantoms congregating and exchanging secrets. They
manifest among the trees and drift to the cottage’s broken
doorstep, where they hover for the remainder of the night.
Approaching the phantoms: If approached with proper
deference, they converse warily with the living; if
provoked, or if any Drunes are with the party, they attack.

Muttering Phantoms
Humanoid figures composed of tendrils of mist and
eddies of dead leaves, which combine into larger vortices when the phantoms gather. These minor ghosts are
created when a mortal dies clinging to a perilous secret.
In death, they value secrets above all else, trading them
as a form of currency.
Demeanour: Curious, suspicious, argumentative.
Speech: Urgent, barely intelligible murmurs, which
become clearer when conversing with the living. Woldish, Old Woldish, some Drunic.
Desires: To collect and trade secrets. To cause mischief
for the Drune, whom they dislike and fear.
Rewards: Once per week, the phantoms are willing
to share a single secret of their own (see Secrets of the
Phantoms), in exchange for a non-trivial secret of equal
value. If the PCs share an untrue secret, the phantoms
manifest and attack them in their sleep 1d3 days later,
regardless of location.

The Big Chook (hex 0606) is in sooth a psychic
emanation of a nightmare-plagued dragon slumbering in the lakebed.
There are still frost elves living in Dwelmfurgh, in a
place hidden behind the Falls of Naon (hex 0504).
The Drune guard a magical mirror of great power
upon the Phantom Isle (hex 0706).
The legendary robber Dewidort of Smerne hid his
treasure horde close to Wight Falls (hex 0607).
The being called the Hag was once a fairy princess;
her hut can be found by searching in the central
regions of Hag’s Addle (hex 0908).
The lost tower of the renegade Drune called the
Aubrathon is on an isle in the Brinemere (hex 1103).

Undead: Silent before attacking. Immune to biological
effects (e.g. disease, poison) and mind-affecting spells
(e.g. Vapours of Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).
Immunities: Only harmed by silver weapons, magic,
or magic weapons.
Slow death: The victim is cursed to suffer a melancholic
yearning for death. They must Save Versus Spell each
morning upon awakening or suffer 1d3 damage, fading
into nothingness should they reach 0 HP. The curse can
be reversed by magic of curse removal or by sharing a
worthy secret with the phantom.

Fort Vulgar and the Galoshers’ Pool

0604

Tangled woods of holly and hawthorn, riddled with muddy mires and ponds ringed with thorny reeds.
Terrain: Thorny forest (4), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with 1d3 galoshers in the vicinity of a pond.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Fort Vulgar
An old stone keep overlooks a village and ramshackle dock,
where barge-folk and merchants congregate to trade. Few
folk permanently reside here.
Chappily bridge: Spans Quogg's Creek at Fort Vulgar.
Big Chook: Fort Vulgar lives in the shadow of the lake
monster known as Big Chook, whose mind-wrenching
wails can be heard from the settlement.
Full settlement description: See p146.

The Galoshers’ Pool
In the briar-choked western reaches of this hex lies a shallow pool of muddy, black water, 100 yards across, rimmed
with frothing green scum.
Approaching: Coming near to the shore attracts the
attention of the 6 galoshers (DMB) that dwell in the mud.
Initially a single monster emerges, but the others soon
arrive if commotion ensues.
Bodies in the mud: Submerged in the mud around the
shore are a multitude of humanoid bones, the partially
preserved corpses of 3 travellers (each with 1d100gp),
and the still-living Gherigew Thorncripe, in suspended
animation and surrounded by a swarm of feeding galosher
lampreys (see Dream feeding under Galoshers, DMB).

Gherigew Thorncripe (Level 6 Bard)
A dashing human man in his early 30s, with twirled
moustache, pointy beard, curly chestnut hair, and twinkling grey eyes. Dresses in leather woodland garb, a
crimson cape, and a green bycocket hat. Soaked, filthy,
and delirious after being submerged in the Galoshers’
Pool for months.
Demeanour (Neutral): Merry, sentimental, vain.
Preens his moustache.
Speech: Eloquent and poetic. Woldish, Old Woldish,
butchered Sylvan.
Desires: To behold the fabled beauty of the Lady of
Spring Unending (0402). To hunt with Duke Mai-Fleur
(p30). If rescued: to explain his long absence to his
lover in Prigwort, Maydrid Hydball (p178), with an
epic song detailing his imprisonment (which he has
already begun composing).
Possessions: A gold-inlaid lute (500gp), an emerald-pommelled Fairy Shortsword (p412), a sealed tube
containing arcane scrolls of Levitate and Paralysation,
a bronze and violet garnet brooch in the form of an ivy
leaf (1,000gp).
Reward: If rescued, Thorncripe offers his eternal gratitude and service to the PCs (though is likely to be
distracted by his own quests before long).

0605

The Folk of King Capricorn
Murky waters, 50′ deep, dotted with patches of purple-flowering lilies and tangled weeds.

Terrain: Aquatic, Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with Big Chook (p253).
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Call of the Merfauns
Those who sail the waters of this hex during the day
are sure to encounter the folk of King Capricorn—the
merfauns who dwell in the lakebed here.
Sighting: Merfauns are typically sighted lounging and
frolicking among the thick beds of weeds and white lilies
that dot the surface of the lake.
Call: The merfauns call out to passing boats, merrily
inquiring after exotic land-goods such as cheeses and ale,
which they gladly trade for fish or silver coins stamped
with the head of their liege, King Capricorn.

The Palace of King Capricorn
The lake bed is riddled with a complex of natural, waterfilled caves, which have been expanded by the merfauns.
90 merfauns (DMB) inhabit this complex.
Guarded entrances: Four entrances to the open water
exist, gated with rusty metal bars. Each is guarded by 1d3
merfauns (DMB).
The great hall: The entrances lead to a central cavern lit by
glowing clam shells. Debauched feasts of pondweed and
lake fish are served here, to the music of great drums and
aquatic pipes, presided over approvingly by King Capricorn himself. 3 giant catfish (DMB) are chained here and
can be commanded to attack intruders.
Living quarters: Smaller tunnels lead from the great hall
into the private chambers of the merfauns, decorated with
shells and stone carvings, with beds of soft weeds.
The King’s chambers: Guarded by 2 elite merfauns (16
Hit Points), the king keeps a harem of three honoured
merfauns and three human men.
Treasures: A hoard of 850pp, 1,200gp, and 2,400sp is kept
by the merfauns, along with 20 pearls (500gp each).

King Capricorn
An ancient, barrel-bodied merfaun man with huge,
spiralling horns and a green beard as long as his tail.
Demeanour (Neutral): Jovial, brash, regal.
Speech: Bombastic, punctuated with rollicking roars.
Woldish, Merfolk, Sylvan.
Desires: To be rid of the menace of Big Chook. Uninterested in the political concerns of the wider world.
Reward: For permanently dispatching Big Chook,
the king awards PCs a whelk-encrusted horn which
summons a giant catfish (DMB) for 1 hour, to aid one
who blows the horn underwater. The horn can be blown
once per week and works in any large body of water. It
is worth 8,000gp.
Knowledge: The king fondly recalls how, in ages past,
he would experience the exhilaration of swimming
alongside Gheillough (p37), the “noble, magnificent
silver-scaled water dragon that once embodied all the
magicks of the Mere.” Wistfully, he notes Gheillough
vanished some 400 years ago; since then, “the waters
turned,” and Big Chook first started appearing. So too
did other unsettling phenomena, such as an “awful,
eel-infested mound” on the lake bottom, which Capricorn can direct PCs to (hex 0606).
Possessions: A Fairy Trident (p412)—1d6+2 damage—
that inflicts an additional 2d6 electrical damage to
Chaotic targets on a successful hit. Worth 7,000gp.
Combat stats: Merfaun (DMB), with 40 Hit Points and a
+4 bonus to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.

252

Big Chook and the Dreaming Dragon

0606

Cold, choppy waters, 300′ deep, wracked with chaotic winds.
Terrain: Aquatic / craggy forest, Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Aquatic encounters are 3-in-6
likely to be with Big Chook.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

The Wailings of Big Chook
Those who brave the choppy waters of this hex occasionally hear a demented, cockerel-like wailing echoing across
the lake. This is the cry of the abominable lake monster
known as Big Chook.
Effect of hearing: Up close (240′ or closer), the wail of Big
Chook has magical effect (see Mind Melt under Big Chook
combat stats). At greater distance it is merely unnerving.

Big Chook’s Lair
In the north-eastern reaches of the hex, voyagers notice
a curious eddying in the lake’s waters. Explorers with
water-breathing ability who follow the eddy downwards
arrive at a whirling vortex of sludge at the lakebed, some
300′ below the surface. Those entering the vortex are
drawn into the dream-lair of the Big Chook.
Appearance: A great aquatic cavern hung with scintillating stalactites and carpeted with groping fronds of purple
seaweed as long as horses. Schools of orange, cyclops-eyed
fish dart among the weeds, gazing at intruders.

Big Chook
An awful chimera, 30′ long, with the body of a pike
and three cockerel’s heads on the end of scaly, sinuous
necks. The monster’s whole body is covered in pink,
orange, and rust scales, dotted with horrid barbs and
blind, weeping eyes. Although it manifests as a physical
being, the Big Chook is in truth an emanation of the
nightmares of the sleeping Wood God Gheillough (see
The Dreaming Dragon).

Immunities: Only harmed by magic or magic weapons.
Mind melt: All within 240′ who hear the cockerel-like
wailing of the Chook must Save Versus Spell. Those
who fail are stricken with fear and flee for 1 Turn. Those
within 90′ additionally lose 1d6 points of Wisdom and
1d6 points of Intelligence, permanently.
If killed: As a dream emanation, Big Chook cannot be
truly slain. If reduced to 0 HP, it dissipates in a noisome
purple cloud, which drifts to the location of Gheillough
(see The Dreaming Dragon). The Chook then reappears
upon the next night of the full moon.

Inhabitants: The Big Chook (3-in-6 chance of being
at home) plus its mates: 3 giant pikes (DMB), hiding in
the seaweed. Opposing side has a 3-in-6 chance of being
surprised.
Treasure: Piled at one side of the cavern are hundreds
of slime covered, fish-eaten corpses—the remains of the
Chook’s victims. Among them can be found 329pp, 8,394gp,
5,667sp, 9,400cp, 50 × 250gp value gems, a shimmering
black suit of Fairy Chainmail (p400), a thorn-like Arcane
Spear (p412), a red-bladed Holy Shortsword (Treacherous,
p412), a Fairy Jar (p420), and a magically-waterproofed
scroll, written in High Elfish, with clear directions to the
secret entrance to the hidden embassy of the Cold Prince
at the Falls of Naon (hex 0504).

The Dreaming Dragon (Hidden)
Buried within a 50′ wide mound of mud that seethes
with eels at the lakebed is the water-dragon Gheillough
(p37). The Wood God lies in a dream-wracked torpor,
poisoned by the noxious emanations of Atanuwë (p45).
Digging into the mud: Reveals the Wood God’s coiled,
comatose form—a silver-scaled water-dragon, 80′ long,
with lolling orange tongue and teeth like crystal shards.
Scrying: Veiled by the emanations of Atanuwë, Gheillough
is invisible to scrying magic.
Awakening: While Big Chook is manifest, Gheillough
cannot be awoken. If Big Chook is slain, powerful magic
(e.g. a wish, a Staff of Cancellation, or Dispel Magic versus a
Level 24 caster) can weaken Atanuwë’s hold on Gheillough
enough to awaken it.
Slaying: The comatose Wood God can be slain with a single
blow from a magical, bladed weapon.
If slain or awoken: See Gheillough, p37 for details on
the effects this would have on Dolmenwood as a whole.

Wight Falls and Smerne’s Lost Hoard
Bluffs and great boulders of granite, many carved with Drune owl symbols.

Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Wight Falls
The circuitous Skull Creek ends here at Wight Falls, plummeting 100′ over a sheer granite cliff into Lake Longmere.
Top of the falls: Peering over the edge, a cave behind the
base of the waterfall can be clearly spied.
Cliff path: A treacherous path along the cliffside allows
transit between the base and top of the falls. Encumbered
characters have a 1-in-6 chance of slipping.
Base of the falls: A narrow bay of algae-coated boulders,
misty spray, and little rock pools.
Cave behind falls: In a deep cave behind the falls stands a
heavily calcified statue of a breggle woman holding aloft
a horned crown. This is a monument to Hraigl, reputed
ancestor of the longhorn noble houses, who died at the
base of the falls (see History, p14). It has stood here
intact for centuries, as the Drune shun Wight Falls.
Searching the crown: Tucked among the horns is a pouch
containing 108gp, marked with the “thorned eye” crest of
House Ramius (p65), left here as an offering.

Dewidort of Smerne—Ghost
A faint blue, spectral human gentleman with pointed
moustaches and a sabre at his side. Dressed in
outmoded dapper ruffs and frilly doublet. His ghostly
ringlets waft in an imaginary breeze. In life, Dewidort
was a notorious highwayman who terrorised travellers
along Swinney Road, before being caught and hanged in
Prigwort. His ghost now lingers in this hex, where his
treasure is hidden, and haunts Swinney Road at night.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Alternates between dashing
camaraderie and deranged fury.
Speech: Gentlemanly, archaic. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: To terrorise the living. To keep his treasure
hoard (see Smerne’s Lost Hoard) secret.
Combat stats: Spectre (DMB).

The Hanglehorn
A great hunting horn formed from a polished devil
goat (DMB) horn, carved with battle scenes and inlaid
with sapphires. A stolen heirloom of House Hogwarsh.
Blowing the horn: Once a day, blowing the horn can
manifest one of the following spell effects: Move Terrain,
Petrification, Raise Dead (the latter has a 2-in-6 chance of
shattering the horn, permanently destroying it).
Value: 30,000gp as a magic item. Baron Hogwarsh
(p60) would pay up to 10,000gp for it.

254

Smerne’s Lost Hoard (Hidden)
Deep in a secluded, moss-draped valley stands a 20′ tall
granite boulder, split down the middle. The stone—known
to the Drune as the Willingstone—exudes an aura of stillness, as if rooted in the primordial past.
Touching the stone: Sends a character into a dreamlike
reverie wherein they experience the manifestation of their
heart’s desire, lasting as long as the stone is touched.
Lingering at the stone: Attracts the ghost of Dewidort of
Smerne, attempting to nonchalantly or violently deter
visitors from the site, protecting his treasure hoard, which
lies magically hidden within the Willingstone.
The hoard of Dewidort of Smerne: Hidden inside the stone
by the power of the magic ring Smerne possessed in life
(see hex 0501) is a plain wooden box containing: a diamond
necklace (3,000gp), a ring of ruby and gold (2,000gp), 4
platinum bars (500gp each), and the Hanglehorn.
Speaking the word “Egrydgenn”: Uttering the word
inscribed on the wolf statue in the ruins of Smerne (hex
301) causes the hoard to drift out of the stone and fall to
the ground. Dewidort immediately attacks.

The Shrine to St Galaunt (Hidden)
The lost shrine to St Galaunt is concealed in reed beds at
the shore of Lake Longmere, partially submerged in silt.
Structure: A simple, wood-shingled wayside shrine.
Statue of St Galaunt: A rotting wooden statue depicts the
saint holding a holy book in one hand and a fat, smiling
frog in the other.
Prayer: If the shrine is extricated from the lake, characters
praying may receive the blessing of St Galaunt: the ability
to cast Holy Quest. See Shrines, p22.

The Snake Witch

0608

Gnarled trees perch among cliffs and jagged promontories of slate. Ravens roost here in great numbers.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with 1d8 adders (DMB) or 1d3 giant pythons (DMB).
Ley line proximity Chell/Ywyr: Arcane spell-casters
perceive the distant moaning of the dead and the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions of
Spirithame (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

Hanging Bones
In the central regions of this hex, the mightiest, most
venerable, and most gnarled trees are hung with rattling
arrangements of humanoid bones: skulls dangling
lop-sided from cords, ribs strung up in star formations,
arm and thigh bones bound around trunks. The fastidiously cleaned bones are of human and breggle origin.

The Snake Cave
Near the centre of the hex, a jagged canyon descends to a
cave mouth from which wafts a stale, carrion scent. Fanglike stalactites lend it the appearance of a gaping, serpentine mouth. The cave mouth is festooned with thorny
creepers and humanoid bones (see Hanging Bones).
Interior: Beyond the mouth lies a 100′ wide, circular
cavern, carpeted with faintly luminescent violet lichen
and hung with hundreds of slender stalactites. Three
cramped passages wind to Grwith’s lair (hot, carrion scent),
the Tenebrous pool (cold, damp), and the Hatching chamber (faint slithering sound).

Hatching chamber: A pillar of slimy grey gristle covered
with hundreds of fist-sized eggs. Within the translucent
shell of each egg can be seen the pale, squirming form of
a baby snake.
The ritual of serpentine doom: The eggs in the hatching chamber are the fruit of years of Grwith’s secret
arcane research. Once hatched and fed on human blood,
each snake magically seeks out and attempts to murder
a specific member of the Drune cult. She requires the
complete skeletons of two dozen Drunes to complete the
hatching ritual.

Inhabitants: Grwith the Scaled, witch High Priestess of
Southern Dolmenwood (p76) and the 12 giant pythons
(DMB) that serve Grwith, charmed by her staff.
Visitors: Grwith repels intruders with violence and magic,
unless they bring a gift of flesh (she favours the meat of
humanoids). If suitably propitiated, she shares information
about the surrounding region, especially relating to the
movements of the Drune.
Grwith’s lair: A dry chamber, stiflingly hot, strewn with
moulted snake skins and humanoid bones. Scrawled
repeatedly on the walls is a curled worm emblem (a sigil
of the Gwyrigon Limwdd—p38). Buried beneath the
snake skins are 5 silver daggers with amber-encrusted
hilts (1,000gp each), an octahedral flask of Prismatic Elixir
(p414), a tiny crystal vial of Dimensional Solvent, Silver
(p402), and necklace of onyx chunks (1,500gp).
The tenebrous pool: A subterranean pool that snuffs out
all light (both magical and mundane) brought within 15′ of
it. Bathing in the cold, black waters, a humanoid gains +1
Constitution. Repeated bathing causes a person to slowly
take on serpentine qualities (e.g. scaly skin, the ability to
unhinge the jaw, a forked tongue, a ravenously carnivorous
appetite, etc.).

The Trothstone and the Owl Cave
Steep, bracken-clad mounds with boggy pools and sluggish rivulets at their feet.

Terrain: Hilly forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d6 portions of
Wolfsbane (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

The Trothstone
An old path leads north-west into the forest from the western road out of Lankshorn (hex 0710). Those who follow
the path about a mile into the tangled wood come upon
a pine glade.
Plinth and monoliths: The glade is dominated by a dark
stone plinth and a pair of guardian monoliths of ancient
construction.
The Trothstone: The plinth is known to locals as the Trothstone, and it is traditionally here that weddings of longhorn nobles take place.

Owl Cave
Those who venture beyond the Trothstone into the deep
wood come within the territory of a group of 4 witch owls
(DMB) that make their lair in a stalactite-hung cave.
Encrusted statue: At the rear of the cave stands a 5′ high
statue of roughly human form, rimed with a sparkling
crust of mineral deposits.
Chipping away the statue’s outer coating: Reveals an
effigy of Saint Nuncy which was stolen from a neighbouring land some centuries ago and hidden in this cave by its
thieves (a band of delinquent friars). It is of great value to
the Pluritine Church (5,000gp).

256

Lankston Pool

0610

Gently rolling hills populated mostly by sheep and dotted with shepherds’ bothies.
Terrain: Hills (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Marshland and Murky Pool
Under the eaves of the wood lies a region of marshland
centred around a large, murky pool.
Moss-covered sign: A dilapidated, moss-covered sign bearing the inscription “Lankston” stands close to the south
edge of the pool.
Submerged town: This is the former site of the town of
Lankston, now wholly submerged in the sludge of the pool.
Spire: The only hint of the lost town, apart from the signpost, is a slime-covered stone spire rising out of the murk
at the centre of the pool—the steeple of the sunken church.
Haunted: Lankston Pool is shunned by local folk, being
regarded as haunted—and, in this respect, the locals are
very much correct.
Floating bodies: The former inhabitants of the town exist
in a deathless state, lying in a dreamless sleep amongst the
reeds and slime of the pool.

At Night
Strange fires: Flicker over the waters.
Bog corpses: Under the pale glow of the fires, the bodies in
the pool rise as bog corpses (2d6 on any given night, DMB)
and emerge, shambling through the woods in search of the
living. Victims are dragged into the pool, increasing the
“population” of the submerged town.

The Hand of St Howarth
An eerily throbbing, mummified left hand, preserved
in a striking semblance of life. Scars on the palm depict
a Chapes holy symbol, bleeding as if freshly incised.
One who takes the hand from its resting place in the
sunken church is affected as follows:
Cursed: Jealously possessive of the hand, cannot
discard it, and attempts to hide it from others.

The Submerged Town

Chaos speech: Can speak with all Chaotic creatures.

A rotting, slime-filled cluster of wooden dwellings lies at
the bed of the pool, 20′ below the surface.

Insidious lies: Once a day, can convince a single person
of the absolute veracity of a statement made. Such lies
cannot be detected by magic.

Aquatic exploration: Adventurers with a penchant for
aquatic exploration may be able to extract small trinkets from the sunken town, although most of the objects
possessed of old by the inhabitants of Lankston are now
reduced to sludge.
Sunken church: The eerily throbbing left hand of Saint
Howarth the Accursed (p68) lies, perfectly preserved, in
the reliquary of the sunken church. The miserable fate of
this town was brought about by the presence of this relic;
the original owner’s fall from grace caused an immediate
reversal in the miracles associated with him.

Grafting: The owner may cut off their own hand and
attach the relic. Doing so causes a permanent loss of
1d4 Hit Points and bestows the ability to make a paralysing touch attack thrice a day (Save Versus Hold or be
paralysed for 6 Turns: aware but unable to move or act).
Value: The hand is worth 20,000gp as a magic item.

Removing the hand from the pool: The curse on Lankston
is lifted, allowing the undead inhabitants to finally rest
in death.

257

0611

The Magpie Gang
Deeply rutted country lanes shaded by looming hedgerows 10′ tall.

Terrain: Farmland (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Magpie’s Oak
In the northernmost part of the hex, where the farmlands
give way to low hills, an ancient, gnarled oak wallows in a
thicket of silver-leafed ivy. Silver trinkets such as bracelets,
necklaces, and talismans hang from the oak’s crooked
branches as flocks of magpies watch from their perches.
A sturdy reinforced wooden door is set into the base of
the trunk.
Climbing the oak: The magpies eye climbers warily.
Anyone attempting to remove the trinkets is attacked by
1d6+4 angry magpies (as hawks—DMB). There are 20 trinkets altogether, worth 1d10gp each.
Listening at the door: The gruff chuntering of an older
man stirring a pot, occasionally erupting in coughing fits.
Inside the Oak: The natural ceiling reaches 18′ high while
the circular room spans 20′ in diameter, with various holes
leading outside. King Magpie tends to a pot of thick green
soup. A rug barely covers a trapdoor leading to Magpie’s
Cellar. Shelves along the walls are packed with shiny
objects: pots, pans, tins, and spoons.
Visitors: Are welcomed for a bowl of pea soup and probed
for tidbits of knowledge about Fairy and possible sources
of fairy silver. If attacked, King Magpie cries for help,
summoning magpies (see combat stats) and his henchmen
from the cellar to his aid.

Magpie’s Cellar
Wooden stairs lead down into a gloomy earthen lair, 30′
in width and 40′ long. The walls are compacted soil and
embedded with snaking tree roots. A long oak table with
five chairs around it sits in the centre with notes, maps,
candles, and leather pouches spread across its surface. A
cage hangs from the ceiling.
Magpie thieves: Poring over a map at the table and
conversing in hushed tones are 4 henchmen (Level 3 fighters—DMB). Like their master upstairs, they dress in black
and white feather cloaks with beaked hoods.
Reading the paperwork: Maps and notes pointing to an
upcoming raid on road merchants around High-Hankle.
A particularly prosperous silversmith is due to travel from
the town in 1d4 days time.
Inspecting the cage: Reveals the imprisoned pink sprite
(DMB) Feathertoe, bruised with her wings clipped, as well
as a tiny burning forge and a minute anvil. She is being
forced to forge fairy silver, but has so far refused.
Treasure: The pouches contain 100pp, 120gp, 580sp, and
eight red garnets (100gp each).

King Magpie
A hunched old human man decked in a heavy, beakhooded cloak of black and white feathers. Tangled in
his grey beard are nails, forks, and a whistle, causing
him to jangle as he moves. His eyes are glassy and his
mouth a graveyard of silver teeth.
Demeanour (Neutral): Wild eyes focus on the shiniest
objects a PC holds. Moves erratically and occasionally
flaps the wings of his feathered cloak.
Speech: Croaky and shrill. Woldish.
Desires: Lusts after fairy silver.
Medium Mortal—Sentient—Neutral

Level 4 AC 14 HP 18 Saves D10 R11 H12 B13 S14
Att Shortsword (+3, 1d6) Speed 20 Morale 8 XP 130
Summon magpies: By vocalising a raspy chattering,
the man can summon 1d6 magpies (treat as hawks—
DMB), appearing in 1d4 Rounds. Due to their odd dress
and the shiny rewards they dole out, the King and his
gang are regarded by the birds as a fellow flock.

Feathertoe (Pink Sprite)
Mahogany skin and a pink tuft of hair like a wave crashing on the shore. Dishevelled and dirty clothing, torn
from scrapping with her captors. Two ineffective halfwings flutter inconsequentially.
Demeanour (Neutral): Desperately trying to squeeze
through the cage bars. Her head darts around at any
new sound, almost bird-like.
Speech: Emulates the sound of a bear’s roar in an
attempt to scare off her captors. Otherwise her voice is
light and airy. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: Immediate release. Bloody revenge against
her captors.

258

The Staring Stones

0612

Rugged, tussocky grasses and prodigious thistle patches. Rabbits roam in great numbers.
Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Moonhaw (DPB), in addition to the normal results. The
berries only have their magical effect if harvested at
night, under the light of the moon.

Stony Faces
The sloping expanses of wild grassland in this hex are
dotted with hundreds of boulders, ranging from 10′ to 50′
tall.
Approaching: Viewed up close, many of the boulders bear
a vague resemblance to humanoid faces, some staring at
travellers, proudly upright, others toppled and reclining
in the grass, their eyes gazing at the heavens.
Examining: The boulders appear to be natural formations,
showing no signs of having been carved or worked.

The Staring Stones (Hidden)
Concealed in an overgrown dell in the gentle slope of the
meadows is a ring of six oblong stones, standing 8′ high,
each formed into the visage of a specific animal: a spider,
a bird, a cat, a dog, a goat, a cow.
Staring: Standing before one of the animal statues and
gazing into its eyes, a character must Save Versus Hold or
be transformed into an animal of that type, along with all
clothing and equipment, until the following dawn. (A character who knows the effects of the stones may willingly fail
the Saving Throw.)

Transformed characters: Retain their own wits, but
cannot speak or use any Class skills or magical capabilities. To all intents and purposes they are normal animals.
After-effects: Upon returning to their normal form, there
is a 2-in-6 chance of a transformed character taking on
some behavioural trait of the animal for the following
week. For example, a propensity for eating flies, a desire
to build nests, or a mewling tone of voice.

259

0701

The Ruined Watchtower

Coarse, clawed grasses grasp and tear at travellers’ clothes. Carrion birds cry out, as if warning off trespassers.
Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

The Ruined Watchtower
A stone tower looms on a high hill, like a sentinel surveying the surrounding downs. Windows on the ground and
middle floors gape, empty. Its upper floor has no aperture.
A doorway at ground level leers open, as if daring mortal
souls to disturb the tower’s silent vigil.
Approaching: Shadows seem to flit past the gaping
windows, as if someone or something within watches
those ascending the hill.
At night: Ultraviolet blue fire flickers over the tower’s
surface, streaming into the heavens.

Inside the Tower
Ground floor: Barren flagstones, scattered with windblown debris. No plant has dared to intrude. A ragged
tapestry depicts a grim lord and lady, seated on thrones
composed entirely of wolf skulls, their twelve adult children standing solemnly on either side. A stairway winds
upwards. A stone door concealed behind the tapestry leads
down to the Crypt.
Middle floor: Walls hung with scarlet banners with a wolf
skull emblem. A mighty banquet table and high-backed
chairs of dark wood. Upon the table, a great feast is laid out.
Candelabras burn with an eerie, reddish light. Across the
room, a stairway leads upward. If any living creature enters,
the spirits of the tower awaken—see Spirits Awakened.
Upper floor: Windowless. On a pedestal stands the Malachite Mirror. At its base lies a woman’s skeleton, dressed in
decayed rags (the witch who hid the mirror here—see The
Mirrors of Embala, p75).
Crypt: The skeletons of the lord and lady and their twelve
children are interred in granite coffers, carved with leaping wolves rending humans limb from limb. In the two
largest coffers, the lord and lady lie with their treasures: 2
platinum and jet crowns (2,000gp each), a moonstone-encrusted gold rod (2,500gp), and an ebony Staff of Striking
(p416). Disturbing the tombs awakens the spirits of the
tower—see Spirits Awakened.

Spirits Awakened
Stepping into the tower’s middle floor or disturbing the
crypt triggers the following effects:
Middle floor: The banquet rots away to maggot-crawling
sludge and 2 spectres (DMB)—the spirits of the lord and
lady—manifest at the head of the table, each crowned with
a circlet of red flame. Hissing “death, doom, oblivion” in
Old Woldish, they arise to repel intruders.
Ground floor: The shades of the children emerge from the
tapestry, leaving gaping black holes in their stead. Treat
the shades as 12 shadows (DMB), which can be turned
as undead. They linger in the ground floor, awaiting the
commands of the spectres.

260

The Malachite Mirror
A mirror of scintillating malachite, deep green. This
is one of the long-lost Mirrors of Embala (see p75).
Touching the mirror: The first time the mirror is
touched, a terrible vision of a woman’s head, crowned
with barbs of iron, flickers briefly across its surface.
Her face is flayed, bloody, and contorted with rage, her
ice-blue eyes staring into the soul of any who return her
gaze. This is a glimpse of the Flayed Queen, an undead
being in the northern Table Downs whose influence,
slowly spreading southwards into Dolmenwood, awakened the spirits of this tower.
Powers: Reveals events that occurred in the past in the
current location. A spell-caster can concentrate to sift
through past events, revealing anything from mere
moments ago to centuries past.
Dreams: After using the mirror, a character’s sleep
for 7 nights is wracked with feverish dreams of diving
into the unfathomable darkness of the Groaning Loch,
drowning in the embrace of a great serpent.

Drigbolton and the Oath House

0702

Patches of sodden heathland cling between hills crowned with flaming heather.
Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 2d4 cannibals (see hex 0801), attempting
to capture travellers and drag them back to their lair.

The Hamlet of Drigbolton
Clinging onto existence in the borderlands just beyond
the Duchy of Brackenwold’s northern border, Drigbolton
consists of a cluster of rude cottages and barns and an old
wooden church. It is home to a few dozen goatherds.
Ancient crossroads: Drigbolton sits a few miles south of
the junction of two forgotten roads: the ancient trade road
that crosses the Downs and an abandoned road that once
led to Fort Vulgar (hex 0604).
The King Deer (inn): A cramped place with three round
tables and stools for fifteen. The horns of prize goats are
displayed on wooden plaques behind the bar. The inn is
run by a tall, elegant, middle-aged woman named Frey, a
thickset, red-haired man named Limber, and Frey’s two
adult sons from her former marriage—Wiggyl and Brag.
Church of St Gretchen: A dour, cone-roofed, windowless
structure of rough-hewn cedar boards. A red carnelian idol
depicts the saint carrying a bucket, with a goat at her side.
Characters praying may receive the blessing of St Gretchen:
the ability to cast Purify Food and Drink. See Shrines, p22.
Repast rooms: Remnants of ancient ancestor-worship
survive in Drigbolton. Each dwelling (including the inn)
possesses a locked chamber called a repast room, wherein
the mummified corpses of a family’s ancestors are propped
up at a table in a gesture of prayer and have food and drink
placed in their mouths at dusk each day. The villagers
consider it taboo to discuss these rooms.

Laird Alhoyle Spinnewith IV—Sage
A pale, delicate human man in his fifties, with a sensitive gaze, clear grey eyes, enormous grey sideburns,
and dazzlingly perfect teeth (revealed when he smiles—
seldom). He dresses in quality but well-worn silks and
linens, typically sporting a smoking jacket to accompany the pipe on which he constantly puffs. The laird
is unmarried and set to be the last of his line—he has
devoted his life to esoteric study and has little time for
romance.
Demeanour (Neutral): Vacillates between regally
standoffish and enthusiastically familiar.
Speech: Excessively upper-class. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: The secrets of the stars. Books of occult lore.
Knowledge: Specialises in astronomy, astrology, and
ley lines. Apply the standard rules for hiring a sage
(DPB).

Services at the King Deer
Lodgings and food: Of poor quality (DPB).
Crabber: Bitter crab apple scrumpy, 8cp a mug.

The Oath House
Nestled in a valley in the chalk downs in the north of the
hex stands a small manor known locally as the Oath House.
Appearance: The manor is some centuries old but is well
maintained, with rows of tidily clipped hedges and neat
garden borders surrounding it. Architecturally, the manor
is noteworthy for its single central tower, directly above
the main entrance.
Entrance: Cracked granite steps lead up to a tiled porch
containing solid, black-lacquered double doors with a brass
door knob and a knocker in the form of a mermaid.
Interior: Cheerlessly clean, sparsely furnished halls, with
cosy and much-used libraries, studies, and smoking rooms.
Central tower: A tall, stone room plastered with maps and
charts of the cosmos, dominated by an elaborate, brass
star-viewing apparatus.
Inhabitants: Laird Alhoyle Spinnewith IV—the local
lord and a sage of small renown—and Godfried Whelm,
manservant, cook, butler, and groundsman. Traditionally,
Drigbolton’s headman pays fealty to the laird, though the
latter takes no direct role in the governing of the hamlet.
Visitors: May be welcomed out of curiosity, if they seem
well-mannered and erudite.

Possessions: A rare copy of the notorious Black Book
of Llareggub (worth 2,500gp), describing, among other
demonic summonings, dangerous rituals for communion with the daemons that inhabit stars.

261

0703

The Ruins of Midgewarrow
Trunks swollen and blistered, weeping orange sap. A drear quietude pervades.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 2d4 cannibals (see hex 0801), attempting
to capture travellers and drag them back to their lair.
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 Shub Eggs
(p430), in addition to the normal results.

The Old Road
A track that was once a road, now overgrown with bracken
and slender birches.
Warning signs: Half a mile from the centre of the hex
(in both directions) a series of boulders beside the trail
are painted with crosses and skulls, now faded with age.
These markings forewarn travellers of the vicinity of the
plague town.

Midgewarrow
At the centre of the hex stand the remnants of the ghost
town Midgewarrow, abandoned for two centuries after the
plague struck and the place was shunned.
Ruins: The ruined town is now reclaimed by the forest:
stone walls crumbling and clad with vines, moss, and
rotting fungi. In this state, it is difficult to discern the
purposes of any of the buildings.
The white tower: One structure, however, stands in its
original form, unmarred by neglect and the passing of the
centuries: a white tower in the centre of the ruined town.
See The White Tower for more detail.
Searching the ruins: Characters may discover an arched
tunnel, lined with candle sconces (now covered in moss),
leading down to a pair of still-locked wooden doors. Behind
lies the Chapel of St Eggort.

The Chapel of St Eggort
A vaulted crypt with hundreds of candle sconces carved
from the stone of its walls.
Statue of St Eggort: A life-size rendering of the saint in
simple grey sandstone. Eggort is depicted in a hooded robe,
head bowed, holding a candle aloft.
Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of St
Eggort: the ability to cast Holy Light. See Shrines, p22.

The White Tower
A square tower of pristine white marble with a silver
pennant fluttering at its summit.
Approaching: The tower emits a loud boom if anyone
draws near.
Door: The black oak door is sealed with a Glyph of Locking
(by a Level 7 caster).
Windows: Made of an enchanted glass, unbreakable by
mundane means.

262

Interior floors: A procession of four storeys of utterly
empty (but perfectly clean) chambers lead, via a winding
stair, to a magically locked door (sealed with a Glyph of
Locking by a Level 7 caster). The door prevents entry to the
upper floor, which consists of a single room—a bedchamber in which a woman rests in enchanted sleep. (See The
Bedchamber.)
History: Those versed in the history of Dolmenwood (e.g.
the Lady Harrowmoor, p60) may be familiar with the
tower and its former inhabitants (see Origins).

The Bedchamber
A beautifully furnished bedchamber at the summit of
the tower. Not a speck of dust can be found on any of the
carpets, tapestries, or furniture; it is as if the room had
been meticulously cleaned only an hour ago.
Sleeping beauty: Sleeping in the bed is a young woman
with long, black hair laid neatly in plaits upon her pillow. If
she is examined, purple pustules may be noted on her skin.
Enchantment: An enchantment of temporal stasis is about
her (and the whole tower). It may be broken by use of Dispel
Magic (against a Level 7 caster) or with a kiss.
If the enchantment is broken: The woman—named
Merwyth—awakens. This also awakens the plague which
destroyed the town. Unless cured, Merwyth perishes
within a month, and PCs who fail a Save Versus Doom
also contract the disease. The Referee may elaborate the
details of the plague as required.
Origins: Merwyth is the daughter of the magician Hodrych
who lived in this tower long ago. Fleeing the plague, he
placed his daughter under a protective spell, hoping to
return with a cure for the illness. As fate would have it, he
perished in Dolmenwood and never returned.

Derodand Manor

0704

The stench of rotting sludge fills the air, wafting from stagnant pools around Quogg’s Creek.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Dwelmfurgh / Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Secluded Manor
In the north-east of this hex, near the junction of paths
connecting Fort Vulgar to regions to the north, a track
turns off and heads into a wood of twisted hazel, deep with
ferns. 300 yards along this path is a mossy wall of round
stones and a wrought-iron gate with patterns of curling
ivy. Beyond is a small mansion house, overgrown with
climbing roses: Derodand Manor.
Interior: Wood-panelled hallways lined with stilted
portraits and overflowing bookshelves. Studies and chambers furnished with embroidered upholstery, as was the
fashion a hundred years past. All areas are illuminated—in
an archaic fashion—with candles.
Inhabitants: This is the home of the Lady Emelda Haeroth
(p76), her three maidservants, her 4 Lankston mastiffs
(DPB), and other manor staff. Lady Haeroth is many things:
a noble of the Harrowmoor family; great-aunt to Lady
Theatrice Harrowmoor (p60); and (in secret) one of
the High Priestesses of the witches of Dolmenwood.
A magical household: The Lady’s servants are aware of her
occult practices, though not of her role as High Priestess
of the witches. All are fanatically loyal and would never
knowingly betray her. Her three maidservants have some
small training in the magical arts—each is able to cast
Ingratiate once per week.
Visitors: The Lady is reclusive and enigmatic, and does not
welcome visitors. She releases her 4 Lankston mastiffs
(DPB) on any intruders.
Attic room: In a secret attic room, an item of great power is
kept upon a circular table: a tea set known as the Service of
Calthrounhe. The Lady’s familiar, a witch owl (DMB) named
Hallohoo, watches over the tea set and the room.

Rose Gardens
Verdant rose gardens dotted with statues and follies
ramble languidly behind the manor.
Temple of the Green Man: An artfully overgrown circular temple of stone pillars, a fashionable folly over whose
entrance is carved the benevolently smiling, leaf-ringed
visage of Cwrnus, the Green Man (p36). On auspicious
occasions, members of Lady Haeroth’s local coven gather
here to perform rites praising the Gwyrigons (p74).
Statue of the Forroth: Amid a glade of silver birches, an
odd statue of white marble stands atop a plinth-like slab of
uncarved granite. The statue depicts an entity of roughly
spherical mass, sprawling with tentacles. At its base, an
inscription in Liturgic reads “In memory of Eldrin Harrowmoor. May he rest in peace.” The statue depicts the Forroth
(see hex 1105) and commemorates Lady Haeroth’s brother,
Eldrin, who was driven mad by contact with the entity.

The Service of Calthrounhe
A glass and bone china tea set, painted with owls and
dainty forget-me-nots. Worth 10,000gp. The tea set was
procured for Haeroth by the scrabey Horticule (hex
0705), whose memory the witch subsequently stole.
Powers: Serving tea from the set at night by candlelight summons spirits of the dead to sit at the table
and converse.
Perils: Using the tea set is perilous: one who pours tea
with the dead must Save Versus Doom or have their
maximum Hit Points permanently reduced by 1d3.
Spell-casters of Level 4 or above are immune.

263

0705

The Scrabey Who Forgot Her Name

A rolling wood of hillocks and small streams. Trees are skewed, their roots grasping at the air.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Nighttime encounters on the
road are 2-in-6 likely to be with the ghost of Dewidort
of Smerne (see hex 0607).
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Buzzing Tree
Travellers on the Fort Road may be distracted from the
sweeping views of Lake Longmere by a persistent, insectoid
buzzing sound. If investigated, its source proves to be a
great oak, twisted and gnarly in its old age.
Bees and wasps: A profusion of these insects buzz around
the tree, their nests high in the branches.
Holes among roots: Many small holes and tunnels (1′ wide)
are visible among the roots. Several of the tunnels lead
into a sandy, underground burrow (see The Scrabey’s Lair).
Listening at the tunnels: A single voice can be heard
muttering to itself in a subterranean space. PCs who speak
Sylvan may understand snatches of perplexed speech such
as “Now where did I put that confounded...,” “It must be
time for supper, or is it breakfast?”

The Scrabey’s Lair
A scrabey (DMB) merchant makes her home in a warm,
sandy burrow beneath the tree, consisting of a cramped
living chamber and a dozen store rooms. There is a 3-in-6
chance that she is present when PCs visit; otherwise a
2-in-6 chance per Turn that she returns home.
Access: The scrabey, in her worm form, can come and go
via the small tunnels under the tree roots. Larger passages
lead from the lair into the tunnels of the subterranean
realm of the scrabies.
Living chamber: Unremarkable, sparse, and compact.
Contains a bedroll, a small iron stove, and a chamber pot.
Store rooms: Crammed with neglected, dusty barrels and
crates containing the scrabey’s treasure and goods: 152gp,
233cp, 2,500′ of good rope, 50 flasks of oil, 200lbs of coal, a
barrel of Old Doby (DPB, 20gp, 500 smokes), a keg of Buckston Fizz (DPB, 100gp, 100 glasses), 5 doses each of Gillywort
(DPB), Marshwick (DPB), and Smottlebread (DPB).
Desk and ledgers: In one store room, a desk built from an
eclectic assembly of broken furniture pieces sits partially
hidden behind a teetering wall of empty crates. Beneath
it lie four bulging ledgers, each secured by leather straps
and partially gnawed upon by vermin. For every Turn the
reader spends with them, they have a 2-in-6 chance of
discerning the scrabey’s name: Horticule.
Cocoon and prisoner: On the floor in the corner of
another storeroom lies a 5′-long silk cocoon. Within it,
a young human woman named Amande Heape lies in
an enchanted sleep. (See The Kidnapping Plot.) If fully
unwrapped from the cocoon, she awakens after 1d6 Turns.

264

The Scrabey Who Forgot Her Name
A tiny (3′ tall) scrabey with ears so long their tips droop
below her jowls. Dresses in oversized, damp woollens and an oiled leather overcoat. Once a thriving
merchant, she is now under the effects of a curse of
amnesia placed by the witch Lady Haeroth (p76) in
order to keep the origins of her magical tea set secret.
(The scrabey procured it for her.)
Demeanour (Neutral): Desperately trying to conceal
her disorientation. By turns aggressive and obsequious.
Speech: Veers from confused rambling to shrewd
mercantile banter. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: Should she regain her memory, the scrabey
resumes her extortion plot.
Curse effects: No memory of anything beyond the last
hour, including all details about her past and even her
own name (Horticule). If her name is returned to her,
the curse breaks and her other memories, including
that of the kidnapped woman, also return.
Possessions: A bent butter knife—a Knife of Separation
(p420). The scrabey has forgotten its command word,
but vaguely recalls its importance.

The Kidnapping Plot
The young woman in the cocoon (see Cocoon and prisoner) is the wife of a human merchant named Alfolonious Heape. The scrabey kidnapped her after Heape
attempted to swindle her in a business transaction.
The scrabey had planned to extort a ransom from the
unscrupulous merchant, but these plans were scuppered when she lost her memory (see Curse effects).

Phantom Isle

0706

Cold, clear waters, 200′ deep, abounding with drifting islets of tangled pondweed.
Terrain: Aquatic, Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Phantom Isle
Shimmering mirage-like above the waters of Lake Longmere, 2 miles from the shore, can be seen the apparition
of a small, low island clad with dark, mournful cypresses
surrounding a pillared mausoleum.
At midnight: The isle becomes real for 1 hour and may be
landed upon.
Drunes: Each night, there is a 1-in-6 chance of 1d4 Drune
cottagers (DMB) rowing to the isle. They wear Lenses of
Reflection (p404) to counteract the gaze of the basilisk
that guards The Mausoleum, and bring sacks of fresh meat
to feed it.
At other times: The isle wavers and vanishes if a living soul
approaches within 100 yards.

The Mausoleum
In the centre of the isle is a crumbling mausoleum fronted
with grey marble pillars clad with ivy and carved with stark
likenesses of elfish knights.
Entrance: Great double doors of black wood, in the shadow
of the pillars. A Glyph of Locking (Level 5 caster) and brass
lock in the form of a skull seal the doors. The key is kept in
the Drune Lodge (0507).
Interior: Stairs lead down to a 120′ long, pillared hall, lined
with burial niches. In each niche is a human skeleton
wrapped in black silk. At the far end of the hall stands a
powerful Drune artefact: the Mirror of Canticorl.
Inhabitants: A basilisk (DMB) is chained in the middle of
the hall, in the pitch darkness, hungry for flesh. It is trained
to ignore living creatures if presented with fresh meat.
History: Originally a tomb for elf knights who died
honourably serving the Cold Prince, the structure has
been commandeered by the Drune as a vault to secure
the Mirror. It still holds honourable dead: in this case, past
Drune minders of the vault, interred here with their charge
after death.

The Mirror of Canticorl
A 4′ high oval mirror of glimmering black crystal, set
in a frame of filigreed fairy silver, depicting antlered
skulls. The mirror is an ancient Drune artefact, a
window into a dimensional prison in which a powerful
astral entity known as Canticorl is trapped.
Approaching within 5′: Summons Canticorl, manifesting in the mirror’s surface as a plaintive face of purple
and blue mist.
Communicating: Canticorl can see and hear anyone
who presses their face up to the mirror. The entity
speaks in a dread whisper seemingly emanating from
somewhere behind the mirror, demanding “what
knowledge do you seek from the void?”
Powers: Canticorl can dredge knowledge from unspeakable dimensions. Each week, it may give a truthful yes/
no answer to a single question. Subsequent questions
within a week receive no answer and the questioner
must Save Versus Hold or be turned to stone.
Smashing the mirror: The mirror can only be harmed
by magic, and takes 75 HP of damage before shattering. If the mirror is successfully damaged, Canticorl
manifests, howling in rage, admonishment, and terror,
warning of the danger and folly of harming it. Destroying the mirror instantly destroys Canticorl and the
dimensional prison in a cataclysm of fire and brimstone, permanently vaporising the island and killing
all creatures in a 3-mile radius.
Taking the mirror: Successfully spiriting the mirror
from the island enrages the Drune, who use all their
resources—including their network of spies throughout Dolmenwood—to track down and recover it, and
mete out agonising punishment to its thieves.
Value: The mirror is worth 30,000gp as a magic item.

0707

Catcher’s Bay
Cloudy shallows, 50′ deep, choked with rotting branches and teeming with fish.

Terrain: Aquatic / tangled forest, Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Aquatic or lakeshore encounters are 2-in-6 likely to be with Big Chook (p253).
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Catcher’s Bay
The shore of Lake Longmere forms a wide, sandy beach
called Catcher’s Bay, frequented by the special breed of
angler who dares ply their trade under the enchanted eaves
of Dolmenwood.
Fisherfolk: Visitors to the bay include shorthorns from
neighbouring Shagsend (hex 0708), and other folk from
further afield, all willing to brave the boggin hazard (see
below) for the chance to net rare squids and other catches.
Maids o’ the lake: The waters here are famed as the singular location in which the squids known as maids-o’-thelake (see p116) lurk and may be caught.
Boggins: Characters exploring the shores of this hex have
a 2-in-6 chance of attracting the attention of 1d6 boggins
(DMB). The area is feared as a favoured prowling spot of
these water monsters.
Rumours: Conversing with the bored, loquacious fisherfolk, adventurers may hear about (roll 1d3): 1. The danger
from the boggins. 2. The presence of the maids-o’-the-lake.
3. The allure of “good times” (said with a wink) with one
Agnel (“definitely not a maid-o’-the-lake”), who lives in a
cottage a little way east around the lake, beside the Hameth
(hex 0807).

Submerged Manse of the Boggins
Some 300 yards into the lake, a submerged manse of domes
and twisted spires is visible beneath the lake surface.
Interior: Cramped, weed-choked chambers alternating
with expansive galleries. In the cellars is a locked room
containing the manse’s treasures (see Boggins’ Hoard), as
well as a tunnel that winds below the lakebed into a claustrophobic series of rough-hewn, sludgy, aquatic caverns.
These caves, illuminated by slow-moving bioluminescent
fish, are a large ore mine.
Inhabitants: 20 boggins and 20 human captives. The
captives’ despondent faces are smeared with the foetid,
greenish boggin vomit that allows them to breath underwater. Most of them work in the mine.
Visitors: The boggins fiercely deter visitors, though insistent and respectful conversation can convince them to offer
barter to adventurers.
Trading with the boggins: The boggins are always eager
to obtain new mining implements to replace those lost
or damaged. In return, they offer like-valued amounts
of metals, as well as succulent live eels which they vehemently insist taste better than maids-o’-the-lake. This
is because, the boggins claim, the eels are birthed in an

266

unceasing stream from a nameless magical “giant” who
lies slumbering in deep mud somewhere in the lake to the
north-west. (The “giant” is Gheillough (p37), sleeping
in hex 0606, though the boggins do not know this.)
History: The manse was once the home of a great sorcerer,
known in legends as Hysanth the Amphibious, who accidentally created the boggins in a magical mishap (DMB).
The magician is long dead, but the hateful boggins have
multiplied and spread throughout Dolmenwood.
Boggins’ hoard: A great store of rare ores of zinc and
marsh-copper (worth 5,000 gp—valued by alchemists
and arcane spell-casters), a Crystal Ball (p404), a pearl
Amulet of Breath (p398), and a damaged metal-and-glass
contraption that appears to be a derelict subaquatic single
passenger vehicle (an arcane spell-caster may offer up to
2,500gp for it).

The Hamlet of Shagsend

0708

Verdant paths and glades wind among sheer slate cliffs topped with trailing brambles.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), High Wold / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Nighttime encounters are
3-in-6 likely to be with a Drune cottager (DMB) and
1d4 bramblings (DMB), spying on Shagsend, seeking
their lost comrade, Cranthus (imprisoned in Shagsend).
Ley line proximity Chell/Ywyr: Arcane spell-casters
perceive the distant moaning of the dead and the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

The Hamlet of Shagsend
A fortified breggle settlement built atop a flat hill ringed
with a forbidding wooden palisade. Timber-framed,
thatch-roofed houses with hastily extended attics and
upper floors teeter above the palisade. Fenced glades
nearby teem with miniature swine and strutting turkeys.
Inhabitants: Shagsend is home to some 70 shorthorns
(DMB—40 soldiers and 30 unarmed villagers), ruled by the
sorcerer Hoblewort, a servant of Lord Malbleat (p64).
Entry: The palisade is breached by a large gate, manned by
shorthorn guards. They admit travellers, so long as there
are no Drune—real or suspected—among them.
Fear the Drune: Situated on the edge of Dwelmfurgh,
Shagsend is ever-threatened by the Drune. Locals venture
to Catcher’s Bay (hex 0707) on Lake Longmere to fish, but
do not stray from Fisher’s Path.

Services at the Crab and Copper
Lodgings and food: Of poor quality (DPB). Accommodation is limited to a single shared room (four beds) or
the common room floor.
Giblet dunkers: A local speciality: metallic, bitter ale
with a bundle of pickled turkey giblets. 3sp per mug.

Windore Hoblewort (Level 4 Magician)

The black tower: A three-storey tower of black stone looms
over the hamlet, the glaring red eyes painted at its summit
ominously observing all below. This is the home of the
sorcerer Hoblewort, ruler of Shagsend.

An austere longhorn man with white fur, silver horns,
and pink eyes. Dresses in black robes trimmed with gold
sigils. Walks with a limp. Hoblewort rules Shagsend and
its garrison, under the banner of Lord Malbleat.

Within the tower: Hoblewort’s private chambers in the
upper floor are guarded by a devil goat (DMB) and contain
his arcane library (including scrolls of Perceive the Invisible,
Lightning Bolt, and Arcane Eye). An invisible chest on a high
shelf contains 50pp, 1,300gp, 500sp, and a masterfully
faceted star sapphire worth 2,000gp. In a dangerous act
of hubris, Hoblewort has imprisoned a Drune cottager
named Cranthus in his dungeon (sealed with a Glyph of
Locking—Level 4 caster).

Demeanour (Chaotic): Cool-tempered megalomaniac.
Despises the cultured excesses of his master, Malbleat.

The Crab and Copper (inn): A low, tile-roofed building
with a wonky chimney and bulging walls. The sign depicts
a grinning crab boiling in a copper pot. The interior is a
gloomy, smoke-fogged haze of benches and low stools
where locals drink, dine, and crowd around games of dice
and cards. The owner, a squat old shorthorn woman named
Gwendilore, shouts above the din and whacks unruly
customers with her walking stick.

Speech: Eloquent whisper. Woldish, Caprice, Gaffe, basic
Drunic.
Desires: The secrets of Drune magic. Possession of
Malbleat’s soul-bound tome (p64).
Possessions: Elf-bone Ring of Protection (p410). Ebony
walking cane (treat as a Wand of Paralysation, 5 charges).
Spell books: Rank 1 Shield of Force, Vapours of Dream,
Rank 2 Phantasm, Glyph of Locking.
Servants: 40 shorthorn soldiers, housed in the garrison. A devil goat (DMB) guards his private chambers.

Garrison: Greatly expanded since Shagsend came under
the rule of Lord Malbleat, a 40-strong soldiery is housed
in this blocky, brick building in the centre of the hamlet.

267

0709 The Shadholme and Redwraith Manor
Dense, foreboding shadows. A sense of being observed is exacerbated by the unnatural echoing of sound.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Shadholme
In the far south of the hex, Manor Road passes by the
Malbleat family tomb complex known as the Shadholme.
Lodge: A ceremonial lodge marking the entrance to the
tombs. Guarded by 10 shorthorn guards (DMB).
Crypts: Beneath the lodge lie the crypts of the Malbleat
family, where many generations of longhorns are interred.
The Black Tomb: In the depths of the crypts lies an obsidian coffer housing the mortal remains of the great longhorn sorcerer, Lord Gnarlgruff. Malbleat, obsessed with the
mage’s arcane secrets, visits often, contemplating rituals
to raise Gnarlgruff from the dead.
Secret tunnel (hidden): A concealed trapdoor in the forest
floor close to the Shadholme leads down to a damp tunnel
that emerges in the Church of St Pastery in Lankshorn.
Father Dobey (p158) uses this tunnel to secretly come
and go from Lankshorn.

Redwraith Manor
The Manor Road from Lankshorn winds through tangled
woods to the gates of the estate of Lord Malbleat (p64).
Wall: An ancient stone wall, festooned with ferns and moss
and topped with iron spikes, rings the estate.
Gates: Iron gates, wrought into the shape of two goats butting heads, are secured with a thick chain and padlock and
warded by 1d4 shorthorns (DMB).
Grounds: Within the wall is a rambling and overgrown
series of tiered gardens, fish-ponds, fountains, and small
hedge mazes. 2 Lankston mastiffs (DPB) may be released
to see off intruders.
Hothouse: At the rear of the manor, a dome of glass panes
houses a steamy tangle of vines, flowers, and creepers,
buzzing with flesh-eating flies.
The manor: An ancient building of tall wooden wings and
steep gables, perched atop a rocky peak at the centre of the
estate, accessible by a stairway cut into the stone.
Entrance: Double doors intricately carved with the likeness of Lord Malbleat.

Inside the Manor
Creaky halls and chambers of maroon-varnished wood,
clad with ancient portraits, maps, ceremonial shields, and
exquisite artworks. Rushed staff struggle to maintain the
luxurious, refined furnishings in pristine condition.
Inhabitants: Lord Malbleat (p64), his 2 longhorn wives
(Gerytrud and Hrend), his 5 human wives (including
Bronywyn Baldricke, daughter of Berkmaster Baldricke—
p159), a dozen children who roam the halls at will, a
small staff of servants (shorthorns and humans), 3 longhorn sorcerers and alchemists who assist Malbleat in his
eldritch pursuits, and 15 shorthorn guards.

268

Visitors: Only those bearing an official invite or occult
secrets are admitted for an audience with Lord Malbleat.
Drawing room: Richly appointed with fine oak furniture,
crystal chandeliers, and goose feather cushions. An imposing portrait of a black-horned longhorn dressed in sable
robes and holding a crooked oak staff hangs above the
fireplace, glaring at visitors. The inscription in the golden
frame reads: “Lord Gnarlgruff.”
Library: Protected by a magically warded door and 4
animated suits of armour (as gargoyles—DMB). Ancient,
superbly crafted shelves house hundreds of volumes on
history, poetry, and the occult. Atop a carved walnut pedestal sits a locked glass case, containing Malbleat’s necromantic tome (see Malbleat’s Possessions, p64) and an
ornate bronze page turner.

Lankshorn and the Animal Orchestra

0710

A busy patchwork of wheat fields, cow pasture, hamlets, and muddy lanes. The rustic reek of dung pervades all.
Terrain: Farmland (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

The Town of Lankshorn
A bow’s shot from the looming eaves of Dolmenwood, the
market town of Lankshorn is the gateway from the rolling
plains of the High Wold into the deeps of the Wood.
Breggle country: Lankshorn has been ruled by longhorns
since time immemorial, though unrest is brewing, stoked
by the cruelty of the current liege, Lord Malbleat (p64).
Stone circle: A ring of mossy stones looms over the town.
Full settlement description: See p156.

The Aubrathony Animal Orchestra
Halfway through this hex along Swallop Road, travellers
come to a wooden board by the roadside, emblazoned with
cheerful letters in lurid red and yellow.
Sign: The sign reads “The Aubrathony Animal Orchestra—
Witness the foremost Marvel of the High Wold!” An arrow
points to a nearby side-track.
Following the track: Leads, after 200 yards, to a farmyard
bustling with clucking fowl and scurrying milkmaids. A
hulking barn directly opposite the track greets daytime
visitors with its doors flung welcomingly open. (At night
the barn is locked up.)
In the barn: Rows of wobbly benches on a hay-strewn floor
face a raised stage, sequestered with tatty orange drapes.
Quiet chirping and mewling can be heard behind the
curtains. A curious painting depicting robed figures and
a serpent hangs 20′ above (see The Triptych). A barnyard
odour permeates all.
The animal orchestra: The owner, Berrit Margleman,
cordially greets visitors and invites them to witness her
animal orchestra for a mere 2sp per guest (plus 2sp extra to
view the painting up close). If paid, Margleman draws back
the curtains, revealing several dozen cats, canaries, mice,
and stoats lined up on perches. The animals treat guests to
an amusing and impressively synchronised performance
of popular folk ditties, squeaked, chirruped, and screeched.
In parts, words of human speech are even recognisable.

The Triptych
A time-worn oil painting, beginning to fade and peel.
Unbeknownst to its owner, the painting and its inscription (see below) relate the tale of the arch-Drune known
as the Aubrathon (p55) and his theft of one of the
three Mirrors of Embala from the witches (see p75).
Left panel: An old woman cloaked in white stands in
the woods with three silver mirrors, a gigantic russet
serpent coiled at her feet.
Centre panel: The russet serpent in a great body of dark
water, its head raised out of the waters in ecstasy. Sheer
cliffs loom above it.
Right panel: A gaunt man cloaked in black stands on a
bleak hilltop, holding aloft one of the silver mirrors and
trampling upon the russet serpent, now blindfolded.

Berrit Margleman—Orchestrator

Inscription

A hunched human woman in her 50s, with floppy,
centre-parted hair, a lazy eye, and one gold tooth.
Dresses in a harlequin patchwork of quilted felt, brandishes a long walking cane topped with a cat’s head.

Beneath the triptych is an inscription, written in the
Witches’ Cant (p72):

Demeanour (Lawful): Grinning, showmanlike, vacuously jocular.
Speech: Rustic brogue. Woldish, Gaffe.
Desires: Unusual animals, especially those trained to
perform. Rumours from afar.
Knowledge: Has no knowledge of the origin or meaning of the triptych, which has been in her family as long
as anyone knows.

Husk-y Embala, myrk mother dream dryger,
Scryft glasses three, shant we with thee,
Aubrathon-y Droun, dwimm master kin grafter,
Swart glass he stole, Embala nw wole.
Meaning of the inscription: “Myrk” is the Witches’
Cant word for lake; “dryger” means one who sends; a
“scryft glass” is a mirror; “shant” means to commune;
a “dwimm master” is a master of sorcery; a “kin grafter”
is a traitor; “nw” means therefore; “wole” means lost in
deep slumber.

King Pusskin’s Road
Quiet country lanes wind among farmers’ fields and windswept hilltops.

Terrain: Farmland (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

The Quivering Doily (Inn)
A cute, thatched-roof cottage stands amid apple orchards
at a crossroads where Swinescombe Road and several farm
tracks meet the Swallop Road.
Sign: A lady’s gloved hand holding a doily whose lacework
hints at a smirking face.
Common room: Floor strewn with straw, bales as seats,
barrels for tables. The landlady, Agnel Chudrow, mingles
congenially with guests. Her pet goat, Mable, roams freely.
Portrait: In a place of prominence near the fireplace hangs
a portrait of a fluffy pussy cat wearing a plush crown.
Guests: Rustic farm folk telling tall tales, playing lively
fiddle music, and goggling at travellers.

Roadside Shrine
In the north-east of this hex, close to the eaves of Dolmenwood, a gloomy shrine stands beside the winding, wellused Swallop Road beneath a weather-beaten wooden roof.
Pussy cat portrait: Inside can be found an old lacquered
portrait of a fluffy pussy cat wearing a plush crown (identical to the one at the inn, though more weathered).
Inscription: The portrait bears an inscription: “King Pusskin’s Road—travellers upon the road must leave tribute in
the form of milk or mice.”
Beneath the portrait: A small table houses an array of
mouse skeletons and chipped china saucers (also enamelled with images of the regal cat).
Not leaving a tribute: Although travellers often scoff at the
shrine, dismissing it as rustic nonsense, the power of King
Pusskin (see p33) is very real. Anyone passing along
the road without leaving a fitting tribute in the shrine
displeases King Pusskin, manifesting upon awakening
the following morning (see King Pusskin’s Displeasure).

The Moggle Door (Hidden)
Just under the eaves of Dolmenwood, in the far east of
this hex, is a quiet glade with a circle of mouse skulls at
its centre.

Services at the Quivering Doily
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB). Only
one private room is available.
Cider (“Lanklow’s”): The landlord’s bowel-blasting
scrumpy is the locals’ favoured drink. 1sp a mug.
Mead: Is always in stock. 12sp a glass.

Agnel Chudrow—Quivering Doily Proprietor
A tiny (4′5″), quick-footed human woman in her middle
years, white apron always pristine and brown hair tied
in a long braid down her back.
Demeanour (Lawful): Kindly, motherly, scolds the
disorderly.
Speech: Breathless. Broad rustic accent. Woldish.
Desires: Fairy wines. To visit a fairy carnival.
Family: Husband (Lanklow) is an orchard man and
cider brewer. Children are grown up and moved to
High-Hankle.

Stepping into the ring: Whisks one away to the fairy road
Skipping-a-Derry (see Fairy Roads, p26).

Knowledge: If questioned about the pussy cat portrait,
Agnel beams with pride and says: “That’s our protector
there: King Pusskin. When he’s happy, we’re safe.” She
discloses nothing else about it.

Grimalkin: There is a 1-in-6 chance of a grimalkin (DMB)
entering or emerging from the Moggle Door as PCs arrive.

The Derelict Windmill

0712

Rugged hillsides criss-crossed with sheep paths. The clanking of cowbells echoes.
Terrain: Hills (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

The Derelict Windmill
An old, three-storey windmill, its sails in tatters and its
roof caved in, stands atop a high, desolate hill. The flapping
shreds of sail produce an eerie chuckling sound audible
from some distance away.
Entrance: The door is blocked shut from the inside by
fallen beams. Windows on all storeys are open and large
enough for a slim person to slip through.
Interior: The ground floor is filled with the debris of the
collapsed upper floors, including the millstones. A stone
trapdoor to the Cellar can be spied amid the chaos. All that
remains of the upper floors is a hollow interior space crisscrossed with broken beams and jagged islands of flooring.
Inhabitants: Coiled among the uppermost rafters are
Bharhgda (black bile wyrm—DMB) and her brood of 4
black bile wyrmlings.
Visitors: The wyrm mother is protective of her young, and
is quick to repel any intruders detected. If gifted with food
sufficient for her and her young (e.g. a fat cow), she may
mention the “cold magic” that she can smell in the cellar.
Unable to pass through the trapdoor herself, she proposes
a deal to share whatever PCs can retrieve (but betrays those
she views as weak enough to vanquish).

Bharhgda—Black Bile Wyrm
A mature black bile wyrm with golden eyes and a full
mane of dark purple feathers.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Defensive, hungry.
Speech: Monosyllabic snarls. Woldish, Wyrm, the
tongue of serpents.
Desires: Fresh flesh for herself and her young. The
magic items she believes lie in the cellar, out of her
reach.
Vulnerability: Gold-plated weapons.

Black Bile Wyrmlings
8′ long, immature black bile wyrms, covered in black
fur, with bulging yellow eyes, puppy-like faces, and
panting tongues.
Medium Dragon—Semi-Intelligent—Chaotic

Level 2 AC 15 HP 2d8 (9) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att Bite (+1, 1d6 + acid) Speed 40 Morale 7 XP 35
Acid: Bite is laced with acidic, black drool, which sticks
to victims and inflicts 1 damage for 3 subsequent
Rounds, unless washed off (takes 1 Round).

The Cellar
Conspicuous boot prints lead down a frosty stair to a door
of ice, standing slightly ajar. A crystalline key sits abandoned in its lock. Beyond the door is a frigid, circular chamber whose walls, floor, and ceiling are clad in thick ice. The
place is chilled like a deep, silent winter.
Ritual circle: A circle of runes, 10′ across, is carved into
the ice at the centre of the room. Decipher reveals a ritual
invoking the power of the Cold Prince.
Frozen magician: A block of ice stands at the centre of the
ritual circle. The frozen form of an old woman can be seen
within, dressed in black robes with her arms raised up.
Many centuries ago, she created this laboratory and was
killed during a magical experiment. If thawed, her body
rots away to sludge in a matter of minutes.
Icy plinths: Five ritual objects float above 4′ high blocks of
jagged ice surrounding the circle: an ice-shard Fairy Dagger
(Frost-Rimed, p412), a helm of fairy silver (2,000gp), a
Wand of Lightning Bolts (11 charges), a glass chalice filled
with a vaporous blue liquid (2 doses of Vaporous Spirits—
p414), and a platinum sceptre tipped with a cluster of 4
peridots (3,000gp).
Taking an object: The ritual objects are magically frozen
in time and space, and can only be unfrozen and removed
by means of Dispel Magic (against a Level 10 caster). Anyone
touching a frozen object must Save Versus Spell or also be
frozen (can be released with Dispel Magic).
Frozen thief: A lithe man clad in leather armour and fancy
doublet stands frozen, arm extended towards the floating
sceptre. His face bears a permanent expression of wonder.
If freed (with Dispel Magic), he reveals his name as Simeone
Waylord of High-Hankle. He is a Level 3 thief and associate
of Bagsley Corundum (p153), who may be grateful for PCs
having freed him.

The Caves of Clan Shaggytree

Rocky crags and barren hills, almost devoid of grass. Strange laughter echoes half-heard on the wind.
Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with 2d4 cannibals, attempting to capture travellers
and drag them back to their lair.

Profane Effigies
Amongst the parched, dusty crags loom scattered figures
that, from a distance, look like malformed giants.
Inspecting the figures: Each is a gruesome effigy, about 8′
tall—a macabre amalgam composed of the bones of dozens
of humans, lashed together with poorly tanned leather
strips, topped by a single human skull with an eyeless gaze
directed downward.
Alarm: The effigies psychically alert the cannibals of Clan
Shaggytree to the presence of intruders. Clan members
watch the intruders through the eyes of the effigies.
Destroying the effigies: Removing an effigy’s skull blinds
it, but the vandal must Save Versus Spell or develop a
bizarre mutation—a hideously chortling mouth opens
somewhere on their body. The mouth can be removed only
by magic or by the destruction of the Idol of Atanuwë, in
the caves.

The Caves of Clan Shaggytree (Hidden)
Deep in a maze of rocky defiles and ravines lies the stinking, maw-like entrance to the caves of Clan Shaggytree.
Interior: An endless labyrinth of winding, maddeningly
narrow tunnels, echoing constantly with a maniacal laughter. A dank, charnel humidity pervades all.
Inhabitants: A family of 50 cannibals, presided over by its
progenitors, Sandy and Agnes Shaggytree.

The clan hall: Some way into the caves sprawls the squalid
central cavern of the clan, its walls adorned with the fleshy
tapestries of dozens of flayed skins, its floor carpeted with
gnawed bones. At any time, 3d6 cannibals lurk here, eating,
sleeping, tanning leather, or fashioning spears from bones
or wood. 45gp and 6,400sp, gleaned from the cannibals’
victims, are scattered about.
The larder: Dangling from the ceiling of this long, malodorous hallway are the carcasses of hundreds of animals
and about a dozen humans, curing with salt harvested
from the depths of the caverns.

Fell beings twisted into scuttling, slithering, spindly,
half-human forms by the mad caprice of their master,
the Nag-Lord. Some possess multiple heads, while
others sprout clusters of semi-humanoid arms.

The shrine of Atanuwë: In the deepest part of the caves
lies a stalactite-encrusted cavern dedicated to the worship
of the Nag-Lord, dominated by a massive Idol of Atanuwë.
Sandy and Agnes Shaggytree and some 2d4 cannibals
supplicate here and provide sacrifices of human carrion to
the idol, which whispers darkly in their minds. The offerings disappear when unobserved.

Demeanour (Chaotic): Maniacal, voracious, unwholesomely mirthful.

The Idol of Atanuwë

Speech: Guttural snatches of Woldish intermingled
with a constant chuckling in a curious cadence that
seems to help the cannibals navigate the black tunnels.

A nine-legged monstrosity of primeval stone. Drool issues
from the idol’s sneering lips in a languid flow, pooling
around its stone hooves.

Desires: Sentient flesh to feast upon and to offer to the
idol of their master, Atanuwë.

Drinking the drool: Those who drink of the foetid liquid
dribbling from the idol must Save Versus Spell or begin to
develop strange growths and mutations, while also becoming attuned to the Profane Effigies.

Cannibals

Origins: Sandy and Agnes Shaggytree—the parents
of all the other cannibals—were criminal runaways
who fled the law some decades past and discovered
the refuge of the caves and the strange shrine within.
Medium Mortal—Sentient—Chaotic

Speed 30 Morale 7 XP 20
Dark sight: Can see normally without light.

272

Destroying the idol: The idol can only be destroyed with
magic or blunt magical weapons. Its destruction reverses
all mutations caused by the idol or effigies, destroys all
psychic links to the effigies, and reveals a compartment
beneath containing 3 large, magenta-streaked emeralds
(1,500gp each) stolen from the Nag-Lord by the shrine’s
builders.

Avernal Lake

0802

Gnarled old elms and oaks with twisted, eye-like whorls and branches groping like greedy fingers.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 2d4 cannibals (see hex 0801), attempting
to capture travellers and drag them back to their lair.

Misty Waters
Shrouded in mists, close to the northern borders of
Dolmenwood, Avernal Lake is placid, deep, and mysterious.
River trade: Barges bearing goods between Fort Vulgar and
the realm to the north stick close to the northern and western banks of the lake as they make their way to Quogg’s
Creek, fearing the open waters and the southern banks in
particular.
Disused dock: The trade barges sometimes halt at an old
dock on the lake’s northern shore.
Passage to Fort Vulgar: The barges may sometimes accept
passengers for a fee of 1gp each to Fort Vulgar (the journey
takes eight hours, from this point).

The Sunken Keep
The partially submerged ruin of a small keep of human
origin is visible 100 yards offshore, half a mile east of the
mouth of Quogg’s Creek. It appears to be unoccupied. The
barge pilots have good reason to eschew the southern
banks of the lake: Sowynder (phlegm wyrm—DMB) lairs
in the ruin.
The wyrm’s lair: The wyrm dwells in a flooded courtyard
surrounded by crumbling 30′ walls; at the base of one of
them is a large jagged opening onto the lake.

Days of the New Moon
2d4 witches (DMB) from the local area make their way
here at dawn on days of the new moon to commune with
the wyrm.
The summoning: The witches row out onto the lake upon
barges and summon the wyrm with haunting music.

Walking along the shore: Adventurers walking on the
southern shoreline have a 2-in-6 chance of encountering
the wyrm as it bathes and suns itself in the shallows.

The harvest: The wyrm hovers dreamily above the water,
eyes half-shut. As the serenade continues, a small group of
witches in a skiff approach its flank to milk a magical fluid
from the flesh between its scales. The fluid is a poison that
the witches use in their rituals.

Exploring the submerged ruin: PCs have a 3-in-6 chance of
attracting the wyrm’s attention when exploring the ruin,
and automatically do so when they enter its courtyard.

Intruding at peril: Neither the witches nor the wyrm take
kindly to any intrusions on the ceremony, and react accordingly. They ignore those watching from a safe distance.

Treasure: In one corner of the courtyard rests a portion
of the battlement that has collapsed from above and now
protrudes above the waterline. Under the top layer of
broken stone debris, the wyrm has stored 1,500gp and a
necklace of rose quartz and carnelian (1,100gp).

Sowynder—Phlegm Wyrm
A juvenile phlegm wyrm with 5 golden eyes and a bifurcated tail which she lashes when excited.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Languid, sweetly amicable.
Feigns loneliness to put potential victims off guard.
Speech: Whining, whistling, gurgling. Woldish, Wyrm.

Nights of the Full Moon
On nights of the full moon, the fairy city of the Lady of
Midnight (p33), Tainglass, glitters in the depths of the
lake.
Entering the city: One who descends into Avernal’s
depths and swims towards this vision might, at the Referee’s option, gain entry to Tainglass, though they lose
consciousness in the process, awakening washed up on the
shores of another misty lake that lies in the city’s crypts.
Lost to this world: The fairies of Tainglass pity such castaways from the mortal world, for their memories are void
and seldom return.

Desires: The flesh of sentients, favouring the sweet
meat of grimalkins. The ecstasy of beautiful music.
Finely crafted jewels.
Vulnerability: Roses.

0803 The Toll Bridge and Snarkscorn’s Camp
Trees blackened, twisted, and dripping with ochre slimes, becoming more severe in the south-east of the hex.
Terrain: Thorny forest (4), Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Random encounters here are
3-in-6 likely to be with 2d4 crookhorns (DMB) under
the command of Captain Snarkscorn.
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Woodpurse (p430), in addition to the normal results.

The Toll Bridge
An arched wooden bridge, 6′ wide and 20′ long, spans the
slippery banks of Quogg’s Creek. The bridge is aged and
covered in moss, but stable. Locals call it Griswold Bridge.
Guards: During the day, 1d12 crookhorns (DMB) guard
the bridge. These bridge-wards are under the command
of Captain Snarkscorn (p46), returning to his encampment at night.
River toll: Boats are required to moor at the south bank,
where tree trunks have been driven into the mud, or be
attacked with bows and slings. They are not allowed to
depart until a “docking charge” of 2d20sp per crew member
is paid to the crookhorns.
Bridge toll: Foot travellers wishing to traverse the bridge
are also taxed, at 2d20sp per head. The crookhorns attempt
to rob travellers whom they clearly outnumber.

The Camp of Captain Snarkscorn
300 yards to the south of the bridge is an unruly encampment of 60 crookhorns (DMB)—soldiers under the
command of the brute Captain Snarkscorn (p46).
During the day: Most of the camp’s inhabitants may be
found sprawled in net-hammocks and beds of reed-straw.
At night: The crookhorns dance and cavort around great
bonfires, drinking caustic brews of mugwort and fishbone
and tormenting any humans that they have seized (2-in-6
chance of having 1d6 prisoners in their clutches).
The pavilion: In the centre of the encampment is a whitish,
blood-stained pavilion where the Captain makes his lair.
It is guarded at all times by 4 of the toughest crookhorns
(maximum Hit Points).

The Captain’s Pavilion
Prisoner: A human woman, gagged and chained to the
tentpole. She is a witch—Eye of Ertta (DMB), named
Maydrid, whom Snarkscorn plans to bring before his
master for questioning and corruption.
Writing desk: Stacked with plans and maps.
Four-poster bed: Plush but filthy. Under the bed, concealed
in a pit beneath a rug, is a chest containing an angry adder
(DMB—make a Surprise Roll) and the Captain’s Hoard.

274

The Captain’s Hoard
Coins: 1,784gp, 984sp, 2,321cp.
A fist-sized aquamarine: 5,500gp.
A spiralling black horn: Slick with a stinking oil. Licking
the oil brings on a trance lasting 1d4 hours, wherein one
may communicate with the Nag-Lord, Atanuwë (p45).
Those who are not under Atanuwë’s direct command must
Save Versus Spell or be cursed: they become Chaotic, and
their Intelligence and Wisdom are reduced to 3. The horn
is worth 3,000gp.

The Summerstone Hadrwyl

0804

Clogged with cobwebs and crawling with spiders. Great clouds of flies and gnats emerge from the dank soil.
Terrain: Thorny forest (4), Nagwood / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. In the eastern part of the hex
(outside of Dwelmfurgh), encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 1d4 Chaotic treoweres (DMB).
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Grasping Thorns
The eastern portion of this hex, outside of the Ring of Chell,
is a treacherous tangle of stunted, black-leafed trees with
thorny, claw-like branches.
Grasping: Travellers in this forsaken wood awaken a
wicked sentience in the trees, which slowly come to life
and attempt to grasp onto those who dare disturb their
brooding slumber. Characters must Save Versus Hold.
All who fail suffer 1d6 points of damage from the trees’
rending branches.
Border with Dwelmfurgh: The trees that line the border
with Dwelmfurgh (along the path of the Ring of Chell) are
frozen and dead, their brittle branches blanketed with
frost.
In Dwelmfurgh: On the other side of the frozen border is
a normal wood of hawthorn and blackthorn, untainted by
the toxic influence of Atanuwë.

Crookhorn Heads
Travellers in this hex are likely to come across the decapitated heads of crookhorns, skewered atop stakes. Some
are fresh and gory, while others are skulls, picked clean
by birds.
Origin: The skulls are victims of the Audrune Hermanach,
guardian of the Summerstone Hadrwyl, placed to deter
intrusion by Atanuwë’s minions.

The Summerstone Hadrwyl (Hidden)
An evergreen glade of beech and hawthorn surrounds a
15′ shard of black basalt. This is the Summerstone named
Hadrwyl, also called the Sagestone. (See The Ring of Chell,
p20 for full information on the Summerstones.)
Balmy stillness: The stone is surrounded by a 120-yard
radius of hazy warmth and balmy stillness of the air, reminiscent of the intoxicating days of high summer.
Overwhelming aura: All who enter the glade (within 60′
of the stone) must Save Versus Spell or be blinded for 24
hours, their eyes veiled with frost.

The Audrune Hermanach
A short, stocky, shaven-headed human man with dark,
sparkling eyes, a pointy, freckled nose, and a long braid
of black beard hanging from his chin. He dresses in the
traditional night-black cloak and hood of his order.
Hermanach lives in the woods around Hadrwyl, spending most of his time in the form of a raven (using his
magic ring—see Possessions).
Demeanour (Neutral): Dispassionate, stands eerily
still.
Speech: Soft yet forceful. Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: To destroy the crookhorn garrison in hex
803. To discover the location of the Aubrathon’s secret
tower (see hex 1103).
Possessions: A tarnished copper Ring of Animal Affinity
(Ravens, p410).
Combat stats: Audrune (DMB).
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Oracle. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18 for details
on learning this spell.
Touching: While touching the stone, all written languages
can be read without fail.
Prophetic dreams: Blinded victims of Hadrwyl who sleep
the night nearby receive a prophetic dream containing
symbols and allusions hinting at the answer to a question
which perplexes them.

Guardian: The Audrune Hermanach and 6 bramblings
(DMB) who serve him. Hermanach is indifferent to travellers sleeping here, but does not allow any to touch the
Summerstone.

275

0805

Prigmarinn Hill
Elegant silver birches in chalky soil. An occasional tall hill punctuates the flat terrain.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Nighttime encounters on the
road are 2-in-6 likely to be with the ghost of Dewidort
of Smerne (see hex 0607).
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Mallowheart’s Repose (Inn)
A decrepit manor house with a peculiar turret at one end
stands upon a hill overlooking Lake Longmere. The place
now functions as an inn.
Sign: A blue-skinned, pointed-eared fop (supposedly the
fairy Prince Mallowheart, see p34) recoiling as a door
is slammed in his face.
Common room: A high-ceilinged hall lined with dented
wooden panels. The landlord, Sedgewick Ulmer, serves
drinks from what appear to be bookshelves. The atmosphere is usually subdued and folk keep themselves to
themselves, for it is said that Drune spies frequent the inn.
Guests: Way-weary merchants, guards, and soldiers, travelling between Fort Vulgar and Castle Brackenwold.

Prigmarinn Hill and The Pillar of Ambule
The Fort Road passes the southern side of a low hill, some
half a mile in diameter, known to locals as Prigmarinn
Hill. A stairway of protruding, rough-hewn blocks of slate
ascends from the road.
Climbing the hill: Reveals a wide, flat, treeless plateau. At
its centre stands a 20′ tall column of roughly hewn chalk.
Approaching the column: Causes a brisk wind to pick up,
blotting out any sounds from the wood below.
Inspecting the column: Many hundreds of names—both
exotic and utterly mundane—are carved into the chalk.
Carving one’s name: The character promises their soul,
wittingly or unwittingly, to the forgotten Wood God
Ambule (p36), who lies sleeping in the chalky chasms
beneath the hill (see Consequences of Pledging to Ambule).
Carving another’s name: Has no effect. The same is true
for defacing or removing names from the chalk.

Services at Mallowheart’s Repose
Lodgings and food: Lodgings of common quality, food
of fancy quality (DPB).
Turret rooms: Fancy suites overlooking the lake. 5gp
a night.

Sedgewick Ulmer—Mallowheart’s Repose
Proprietor
A fresh-faced human bachelor with curly, blond locks
and a habit of dressing in extravagant violet lace.
Recently inherited the inn from his uncle.
Demeanour (Lawful): Hurried, somewhat confused.
Habitually wipes sweat from his brow.
Speech: Country manners. Rushes off before finishing
sentences. Woldish.
Desires: To find a partner (business or romantic) who
knows how to run an inn.

Consequences of Pledging to Ambule
One who carves their name into the chalk column is
affected as follows:

Gawyn's Bridge and Chaffer Bridge

Remove curse: The nullification of one curse or baleful
enchantment.

Gawyn's Bridge (west): A slender, covered bridge that
crosses the chaos-tainted River Shub. Noisome black foam
collects about its pilings, glowing purple at nighttime.
Further downstream, great encrusted floes of foam can be
spied, dissolving into the waters of Lake Longmere.

Save bonus: A permanent +2 bonus to Saving Throws
against curses.
Nightly dreams: Of being chained to the chalk column
on the hill and being consumed, over the course of
millennia, by mosses and lichens.

Chaffer Bridge (east): A bridge of crumbling stone that
spans the River Shiver. Its end posts are carved with Green
Man visages and Chapes holy symbols.

Upon death: The character’s spirit is summoned to this
place and bound to eternal servitude. The character
cannot be resurrected by normal means.

276

The Palace of the Witch Queen

0806

Gently rising and falling beech woods beside cold, clear waters, 200′ deep.
Terrain: Aquatic / tang. forest, Aldweald / Dwelmfurgh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Aquatic encounters are 2-in-6
likely to be with Big Chook (p253).
Ley Line Chell (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the curious dual sensation of balmy heat and biting cold.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.

Wall of White Flame
A sheet of ephemeral, white flame traces the course of Chell
in this hex, forming a barrier separating the lakeshore and
adjoining woods from the lands to the east.
Touching the flame: Is harmless and does not burn.
Crossing the barrier: Characters must Save Versus Doom
(fairies at a –4 penalty) or experience paranoid visions of
watching faces until leaving this hex. Afflicted characters
suffer a –2 penalty to saves against magic and are automatically surprised in encounters.

Eastern Shore of Lake Longmere
A few feet from the shoreline, sheer underwater cliffs
abruptly descend 200′ to the lakebed. Fronds of indigo
kelp line the cliffs, waving in the currents.
Silvery eels: Swarms of silvery eels dart among the kelp.
Entering the lake: The eels serve the Queen of All Witches
(p75), alerting her of intruders in these waters.
Secret door: At the base of the cliffs, a secret door sealed
with a Glyph of Locking (Level 12 caster) among the kelp
leads to a water-filled tunnel to the Grotto and gateway.

The Palace of the Witch Queen (Hidden)
Grotto and gateway: The underwater tunnel ends at
the bottom of a murky, 10′ deep pool. Swimming to the
fog-wreathed surface, visitors find themselves in a tall
grotto lined with scintillating crystals of azure, violet,
and pearl. At the far end of the grotto looms a great stone
gateway into the palace proper, guarded by the Belwycht.

Interior: Rounded tunnels and domed chambers carved
into living bedrock, lit by white flames that flicker within
violet geodes. Elegant suites are furnished with pearl-studded divans, silk-draped beds, exquisite watercolours of
otherworldly landscapes, and obsidian statuettes of the
Gwyrigons. The art objects are worth 40,000gp total.
Inhabitants: Celenia, the Queen of All Witches (p75)
and 6 witches (DMB—2 Eyes of each Gwyrigon).
Visitors: Intruders are charmed and interrogated, then
drowned in the pool of the Belwycht.
Library: Behind an alabaster door, a ring of domed chambers contains a great trove of witch history and lore, as well
as a set of black mirrors that allow one to magically view
the lake and the woods in this hex. All spells known to the
witches can be located here.
Celenia’s chambers: Accessible only by passing through
illusory walls. Celenia dwells amid statues of the Witch
Queens of old. The Selenite Mirror hovers 20′ above the
floor, rotating slowly in mid-air.

The Belwycht

The Selenite Mirror

A 15′ tall stag-headed humanoid cloaked in violet mist,
holding a graven copper bell. This creature of ancient
magic is tasked with guarding the Queen of the Witches,
and allows entry to none but those in her service.

A lambent, milky mirror wrought of selenite. This is
one of the Mirrors of Embala (see p75).

Demeanour (Neutral): Grim, unswayable.
Speech: Stern whispering. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Possessions: The Wyrdbell—may be rung once a day,
producing the arcane spell Word of Doom. The bell is
worth 15,000gp as a magic item.
Combat stats: As mugwudge (DMB) with 45 HP,
immune to non-magical damage.

Powers: The true appearance of all things reflected in
the selenite mirror is revealed. Illusions and invisibility
are stripped away. Magic and Alignment are revealed as
coloured auras. The true form of shape-changed creatures is exhibited.
Dreams: After looking into the mirror, a character’s
sleep for 7 nights is wracked with feverish dreams of
diving into the unfathomable darkness of the Groaning
Loch, drowning in the embrace of a great serpent.

0807

Ignormwm’s Cottage

Thick banks of reeds and stands of gangly willows, amid a maze of stinking waterways. Solid ground is rare.
Terrain: Swamp (4), Dwelmfurgh / Hag’s Addle
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Ley line crossing Chell/Ywyr: Arcane spell-casters
perceive a throbbing warmth from the earth and the
chilling cries of gigantic ravens.
Within the Ring of Chell (p20): True fairies are
afflicted with a spiritual malaise; teleportation and
summoning are ineffectual; magic of illusion or charm
has a 2-in-6 chance of failure.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Bosun’s Balm (DPB) and 1d3 portions of Lankswith (DPB),
in addition to the normal results.

Ignormwm’s Cottage
In the far north-west of this hex, a rickety, turf-roofed
cottage stands on the south bank of the Hameth. Its small
windows are occluded by grubby red drapes.
Entrance: The door bears a crude painting of a busty
maiden and the message “respite for weary fishermen.”
Interior: A single, cluttered room with an iron stove,
a table, several stools, and an ample, fur-decked bed
curtained off in one corner. Dozens of fish hang from the
ceiling, drying above the fireplace. Beneath a bearskin rug
is a locked trapdoor to the cellar.
Inhabitants: The Atacorn Ignormwm, habitually in her
human form (and going by the name of Agnel) in the presence of others.
Creeping up: If surprised, there is a 4-in-6 chance of
encountering Ignormwm in her hag form. The monster
attempts to slay any who witness her thus.
Visitors: Agnel gladly entertains guests, offering bitter
marsh-herb teas and dried fish. Male guests may be suggestively invited to stay the night and led, following a nightcap
of home-brewed eggnog, to Agnel’s bed. She appreciates
payment in the morning, in coin or fresh fish, but does not
scorn those who are remiss.
Subterranean moans: Visitors may occasionally perceive
muffled moans through the floorboards. If asked, Agnel
blames mating swamp sloths.

Spawn of Ignormwm
Wretched, bestial offspring of Ignormwm—4′ tall,
roughly humanoid blobs of knotty flesh, with gaping
maws, weeping eyes, and a spiralling black horn in the
centre of their foreheads.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Brutal, ravenous, lecherous.
Speech: Plaintive gurgling and moaning. Rudimentary
Woldish.
Desires: Freedom from the cellar. To murder mortals
and consume their flesh.

The cellar: A low-roofed space near to collapse. 23 spawn of
Ignormwm lurk miserably in the dark, listlessly gnawing
on fish bones. A locked chest hidden in a corner contains
159gp, 223sp, a jar of Mawbarg’s Jam (p428), and a blue
velvet Bag of Holding (p420—stuffed with dried fish, with
5 blue spinels stashed at the bottom—500gp each).

Ignormwm (“Agnel”)—Atacorn
A horrid monster with the ability to switch between
two forms: a tall woman of lithe frame and bronze
complexion, with lustrous red curls and enchanting
green eyes / a stick-thin, 8′ tall hag with hairy red skin,
staring, lidless eyes, and a flaking, crooked horn in the
centre of her forehead. Both forms dress in a rustic
hessian shift with a goat-skin waistcoat. Ignormwm is
a child of the Nag-Lord (p45), sent out into the world
to spread discord and woe.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Merry, licentious (human form)
/ sullen, brutal (hag form). Obsessively scratches behind
the ears (in both forms).
Speech: Gentle crooning (human form) / violent stammering (hag form). Woldish, Gaffe, Caprice.
Desires: To mate with mortals and enlarge her brood.
To attack Lankshorn, once her brood is large enough.

lasting only 1 week, giving birth to a new spawn of
Ignormwm.

The House of Merridwyn Scymes

0808

Precarious paths wind around sandstone cliffs, avoiding the boggy ditches and reeking fens below.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Daytime encounters are 2-in-6
likely to be with a Lankshorn town guard (p157)
bringing provisions to Merridwyn Scymes’s cottage.

Shuttered Cottage
In a small wooded dell in the south-west of this hex, a
simple, one-storey, thatched cottage stands beside a
cheery stream. Its windows are shuttered and the little
herb gardens and rockeries that surround it show signs of
neglect. The door is unlocked.
Inhabitants: The magician Merridwyn Scymes and her
husband Arb. Following a gruesome magical accident (see
A Magical Miscalculation), the magician’s body has been
split into three separate entities—her viscera, skeleton,
and skin—the last of which killed her husband.
Approaching: Crushed, strangled corpses of small animals
litter the dell. An odd, choked moaning can be heard within
the cottage (see Bedroom).
Living room: Cosy chairs by the hearth. A great oaken
table laden with bread, cheese, preserves, and five leather
pouches (100gp in each). 1 Turn after entry, the skin barges
in from the woods and attacks.
Bedroom: Arb’s strangled corpse lies peacefully in bed,
preserved by magic. Beside the bed stands a copper bath
tub of warm salt water, in which the magician’s moaning viscera spends most of its time submerged, tended
by the ministrations of the skeleton. A plush jewellery
box, hidden beneath the bed, contains an amber necklace
(2,000gp) and a vial of Prismatic Elixir (p414).
Laboratory: Shelves toppled, specimen jars smashed on
the tiled floor. Hidden among the disarray are a scroll of
Shield of Force and Knock, a vial of Bottled Light (p414),
and Scymes’s spell books (see list of spells in viscera
combat stats). Strewn about are incomplete research notes
for the spell Split Personality (see A Magical Miscalculation). An arcane spell-caster could complete the spell with
1d6 week’s further research.

A Magical Miscalculation
Merridwyn Scymes lives an isolated existence, dominated by her research into matters of mutation and
transformation. Several months ago, Berkmaster
Baldricke of Lankshorn (p159), harbouring his fugitive grandson, commissioned the magician to attempt
to cure the boy’s curse. Scymes believes the curse
causes aspects of the boy’s personality to manifest as
physical transformations, and that he can be cured by
splitting his personality into separate physical forms.
A research mishap resulted in the magician herself
splitting into the three entities that inhabit the hex
today. Scymes’s patron, the Berkmaster of Lankshorn,
is aware of “delays” in the magician’s research, though
not their true nature, and continues to support her with
deliveries of food and gold.

Merridwyn Scymes—Viscera
The magician’s nerves, muscles, blood vessels, internal
organs, and brain, together in an amorphous mass.
Demeanour (Neutral): In constant agony. Distraught
at her husband’s death (murdered by the skin) and her
own presumed impending downfall. Desperate for aid.
Speech: Bubbling, rasping whine. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: To have her body restored or, failing that, a

Nightworms

A sandy beech wood, echoing with birdsong. Red, eyeless worms teem in the undergrowth.
Terrain: Open forest (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. After dark, encounters are
3-in-6 likely. Nighttime encounters are 4-in-6 likely to
be with 1d8 nightworms.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Smottlebread (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

The Ditchway
The well-trodden path between Lankshorn and Dreg,
known locally as the Ditchway, makes its winding way
through a broad channel with sandy banks on either side.
Red worms: Every half-mile or so, the sandy soil around the
road is riddled with 6″ long, red, eyeless worms, burrowing
and writhing. These are immature nightworm spawn.
At dusk: The worms slither from the sand banks in great
droves, writhing across the road and around the feet of any
travellers abroad at this hour.

Nightworms’ Brood Lair (Hidden)
A 5′ round tunnel is bored into a sandstone promontory in
the northern reaches of this hex. The tunnel leads down to
a network of chambers and passageways where the nightworms that plague this hex make their lair.
Exploring: Roll on the Chambers table for each chamber
entered. Each chamber connects to 1d4–1 others, via twisting passageways.

Nightworms
8′–10′ long, eyeless red worms, about 10″ in diameter,
with rubbery, ribbed, muscular bodies and tooth-filled
maws. Nightworms lair in underground chambers
bored out by their brood-mother. When abroad, they
burrow into mud and sludge to sleep during the day,
emerging at night to stalk warm-blooded prey. They
drag fresh kills back to their brood lair, being especially
fond of the flesh of humanoids and horses.

1d4 nightworms devour the corpse of a horse.
Walls, floor, and ceiling carpeted with 2″, scarlet eggs.
Inside each, a hatchling nightworm is visible. They
squirm if examined closely. Walking through the
chamber inevitably results in crushing dozens.
A twitching humanoid corpse. Examination reveals
that the corpse is riddled with hundreds of 6″-long
nightworm hatchlings, devouring it from the inside.
The corpse has basic travelling gear, 2d12sp, and a
random human or breggle trinket (DPB).
Heaps of bones—humanoid and animal. Among the
remains are 1d100gp, 2d100sp, 4d100cp, a gem worth
250gp, and 2 random breggle trinkets (DPB).
Piles of rust-red moulted nightworm skins.
Heaps of bones—humanoid and animal. Hidden
among the remains are sleeping 1d3 nightworms.
Rooting around in the bones awakens them.
A Drune cottager (DMB), unconscious and barely
alive, being dragged and throttled by 1d4 nightworms. The Drune has an Arcane Dagger (p412)
of bone and scrolls of Invisibility, Glyph of Locking,
and Haste on his person. This chamber can only be
encountered once—re-roll subsequent results of 7.
The gigantic 30′ long, 4′ diameter brood-mother
nightworm, whose bulbous, eyeless, human-like
head sways and moans for fresh blood. Her abdomen is lined with two dozen stunted arms, groping
wretchedly at the 2d3 nightworms coiled around her
body in a mating frenzy. Her lair is piled with bones
and partially devoured corpses. Among the remains
are 20pp, 542gp, 223sp, 432cp, a single diamond
earring (800gp), a Bag of Devouring (p420), a Cloak
of Displacement (p406), and a holy scroll of Bless,
Find Traps, and Locate Object. This chamber can only
be encountered once—re-roll subsequent results of 8.

King’s Mounds and the Drune Cottage

0810

An undulating terrain of birch copses, chestnut glades, and bramble thickets.
Terrain: Open forest (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Daytime encounters are 2-in-6
likely to be with the Braithmaid Pollith Bonewort,
roaming the woods singing haunting, magical songs.
Nighttime encounters are 2-in-6 likely to be with the
barrowbogey Thrattlewhit, creeping to the Drune
Cottage to catch a glimpse of his beloved Pollith.

Ancient Burial Mounds
In the decrepit old woodland close to the north of the hex
lies a series of long, low mounds, of human construction.
History: These are burial mounds, housing the remains
of ancient warrior-chieftains interred over the span of a
century some 1,800 years ago. Locals scrupulously avoid
the mounds, believing them to be haunted.
Inhabitants: What locals have mistaken for restless spirits
are in fact fairies. The mounds are now home to 24 barrowbogeys (DMB)—led by one named Thrattlewhit—who
dwell among the tombs of the dead.
Treasure: The barrow lairs contain the bogeys’ treasures,
buried in jugs and urns in the sandy soil: 985cp, a platinum
ring set with a ruby (1,500gp), a pair of elf-bone bracelets
inlaid with unicorns in fairy silver (800gp each), a jasper
necklace (900gp), and a heavy gold amulet in the shape of
a bull’s head with emeralds for eyes (2,500gp).

The Drune Cottage (Hidden)
The Audrune Aethogrym (see 0910) maintains a compact
cottage in the east of the hex, in a dreamy glade wherein
spring always reigns and blossom drifts through the air.
Magically concealed: The path to the cottage is enchanted
such that it cannot be found unaided; only by following
one who knows the secret way can the cottage be located.
Kilnling protection: 3 kilnlings (1 sneak, 2 defenders; see
Drune—Drunewife, DMB) created by Aethogrym’s wife,
Maedred, also guard the path and the cottage.
Inhabitants: Aethogrym is often absent, wandering the
ways of the forest and the leys in 0910, while Maedred
(Drune—Drunewife, DMB) remains in the cottage, weaving, singing, and potting. Their daughter Pollith (Drune—
Braithmaid, DMB) roams the woods by day.

Pollith Bonewort—Braithmaid
A petite young human woman with cropped black hair,
chestnut brown eyes, and a freckled nose. Wears simple
white gowns and an apron embroidered with intricate
fungal and floral motifs.
Demeanour (Neutral): Cocky, independent.
Speech: Melodious, impudent. Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: Contact with the witches of Dolmenwood.
To see the frozen spires of Hoarblight Keep (0505). To
be rid of the unwanted attentions of the barrowbogey
Thrattlewhit.

Thrattlewhit—Chief Barrowbogey
A hunched bogey whose diminutive stature is made up
for by the unusually tall brass jug upon his shoulders.
Dresses in decaying burial rags.
Demeanour (Neutral): Mercurial, veers between gleeful capering and suspicious questioning. Stumbles and
sways, as if intoxicated.
Speech: High and tinny as any barrowbogey’s, but
punctuated with strained attempts at a more baritone,
authoritative register. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: Would give anything for the hand of the
Braithmaid Pollith, whom he loves and spies upon at
night.
Possessions: The sword Alfhame, which he brandishes
two-handed in battle.
Combat stats: Barrowbogey (DMB) with 24 Hit Points.

Alfhame—Magic Longsword
A wide-bladed, antique Holy Longsword (Undead Bane,
Drunken, p412) engraved with seven magical runes.
Decipher shows that they spell the name “Alfhame.”
Drunkenness: The sword is psychically tainted by
the fate of its original owner, who was made drunken
and assassinated by a treacherous rival. Anyone who
possesses the sword takes on an intoxicated and suspicious air.

281

0811

Cornew Cliffs
Low, flat-topped hills criss-crossed with chalky paths and dotted with boulders.

Terrain: Hills (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. On sunny days, encounters
are 2-in-6 likely to be with 2d6 young women from
the farms to the north-west. The maidens come here
to forage for the mushrooms known as Lover’s Gasp
(p428) that grow on the rotting tree trunks at the
edge of the Wood. (These mushrooms are said to bring
luck in courtship.) They may warn PCs not to disturb
the cornews (a type of fairy) who live in burrows within
and beneath the rotting trunks.

Sandstone Cliffs
The forest ends abruptly at a shallow sandstone cliff overlooking the rolling hills to the south and the farmland to
the west.
Small caves: Between the tangle of overhanging trees can
be found numerous small caves riddled with roots.
Searching the caves: Aside from birds and small mammals,
the caves are uninhabited. There is a 2-in-6 chance of finding a random human or elf trinket (DPB).

Rotting Tree Trunks
Older trees, in their decrepitude, have tumbled over the
edge of the cliff and lie rotting at its base. The trunks are
covered in mushrooms of various kinds, thriving in the
rotting wood sheltered beneath the cliff.
Foraging: Characters successfully foraging among the
trunks find 2d6 fresh rations of mushrooms (double the
normal foraging yield—roll twice on the edible fungi table,
p118) in addition to 1d6 portions of Lover’s Gasp (p428).

Holes in the trunks: The larger trunks are riddled with 8″
holes, leading to burrows in the trees’ decomposing hearts
and the earth below. Rooting around in the holes attracts
the attention of 2d6 cornews, emerging from the burrows.
Cornew burrows: 6′ underground, at the heart of each
burrow, the cornews keep their treasure: pilfered cutlery
and thimbles, a handful of shiny coins (3d20cp, 1d10gp),
and 1d4 pouches of Moth-Wing Dust.

Cornews
6″ tall fairies that look like pink puffballs with goggling
eyes, gossamer wings, and thin, straggling limbs.
Demeanour (Neutral): Delight in entertaining visitors
with their quaint, squeaking songs. Lay a curse on any
who meddle with them or their burrows.
Speech: Adorable squeaking. Sylvan, basic Woldish.
Small Fairy—Sentient—Neutral

Moth-Wing Dust
Flaky, shimmering dust. Worth 1,000gp per portion.
Throwing: If thrown in the air, a portion of dust causes
creatures in a 5′ radius to Save Versus Blast or rush
towards the nearest light source (possibly the sun, if
outside), fascinated for 1d6 Turns.

The Shadow Revel

0812

Wild, tussocky grassland dotted with copses of oak, each trunk featuring a whorl alike to a suspicious eye.
Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

The Shadow Revel
A gigantic sandstone monolith, 30′ tall and 10′ across,
stands alone in a field of thistles. Those who study the
stones of Dolmenwood know it as Twolgstone. Plant life
in a 60′ radius area around the stone is flattened, as if a
mighty wind had blasted out from the stone.
Shadowy revelry: If shadows are visible (depending on
lighting conditions), a strange revelry can be seen in the
flattened area surrounding the stone. Dozens of dancing
shadows silently move in procession, projected on the
ground around the monolith, prancing and waving their
arms in a rising and falling rhythm.
Approaching: If any living person approaches the revelry,
one of the shadowy dancers reaches out their hand. A whispering voice, carried on the wind, invites: “come and join
the dance.”
Taking a shadow’s hand: The person’s own shadow slips
away from their body and joins the dance, quickly getting
lost in the throng. See Effects of Losing One’s Shadow.
Speaking with the shadows: Every 30 minutes or so, the
dance reaches a lull and the shadows may be conversed
with.
Retrieving one’s shadow: Once mingled among the dancers, a person’s shadow can be retrieved only if it is replaced
with another shadow. Using magic of curse removal, cast
in this location, is also effective.

Dancing Shadows
Humanoid shadows of all shapes and sizes, some
seemingly dressed in elaborate costumes, with broadbrimmed hats, flailing wigs, and masks visible. The
shadows move with a life of their own but are projected
on the ground and other surfaces, lengthening and
contracting as normal shadows, according to the
prevailing light.
Demeanour (Neutral): Merry, elegant. Peaceful, vanish
if attacked.
Speech: Soft whispering, carried on the wind. Woldish,
Old Woldish.
Desires: Live music played by an accomplished musician. More shadows to dance with.
Rewards: The shadows reward anyone whose shadow
has joined their number, or who has entertained them
with music, granting the ability to cast Summon Shadow
(see Uncommon Spells, p454) once. If an arcane spellcaster brings six or more shadows to join the dance,
the shadows reveal the secrets of the Summon Shadow
spell. The character may then copy this spell into a spell
book.
Combat stats: Shadow, DMB.

Effects of Losing One’s Shadow
Someone whose shadow has absconded does not notice
any immediate change, other than the uncanny experience of not casting a shadow.
Reactions: In lighting conditions where shadows are
visible, the character suffers a –2 penalty to Reaction
Rolls (see Encounters, DPB) with everyday folk and
normal animals, who are unnerved by a person unaccompanied by their shadow.

0901

The Bloodied Altar

Steep hills, scree slopes, cliffs, and jagged boulders streaked with what appears to be bloodstains.
Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Sentient folk encountered
within the ring of the Mysterious Cairns are trapped.
Some may have read The Inscription, and seek to free
themselves by sacrificing others.
Ley line Lamm (p18): Arcane spell-casters feel
observed by a pitiless malevolence.

Mysterious Cairns
Visible from a distance, a large area near the centre of this
hex is clearly circumscribed by a series of cairns. These
assemblies of carefully arranged flat stones, many over
10′ high, cast jagged shadows on the surrounding hillsides.
Entering the ring of cairns: Anyone who crosses the invisible threshold demarcated by the ancient cairns becomes
trapped within the area they describe. Attempts to leave
are futile: paths loop back on themselves, and even the
hills seem to shift to cut off escape. Nothing short of powerful magic or the Rite of Escape allows for egress.
Disturbing the cairns: Attempting to dismantle the cairns
is fruitless. If disturbed, a cairn reassembles itself when
unobserved; permanently removing one is impossible.

The Bloodied Altar
At the centre of the cairn-delimited region lies a deep cleft
in the earth, and on its brink stands an ancient stone altar.
The altar is covered in dark stains, and a crude bone knife
lies atop the rough-hewn slab. Graven upon the altar’s side
is a series of elaborate glyphs.
Reading the glyphs: The odd shapes twist and writhe when
viewed, magically imparting their meaning into the mind
of the reader—see The Inscription.
Descending into the cleft: Clambering down into the
ravine reveals that it is choked with broken bones. Mixed
in with the bones are coins thrown in as unsuccessful
offerings by past prisoners (381gp and 1,583sp).

Hermit’s Cave (Hidden)
At the base of a rocky crag within the ring of cairns lies
a small cave, concealed by brush. Within are a series of
natural chambers. The remnants of a fire pit sit near the
entrance; deeper within, furs, tanned hides, and tools fashioned from bone and wood can be found, as well as a small
arsenal of crude bone arrows and spears.
Writing: Marks on the walls appear to track the slow
passage of time, stretching for many years. Hymns of the
Pluritine Church are scrawled alongside.
Corpse: In the final chamber, swathed in furs on a makeshift bed, reclines the slowly decaying corpse of a bearded,
elderly man. In his bony hands, he clasps a Chapes holy
symbol. His mouth is filled with congealed blood.

The Inscription
The hunger of the hills is great,
And one of you its greed must sate.
Now take this hallowed knife in hand,
If ’tis your wish to leave this land.
Turn selfsame blade on mortal kin,
And then perchance your freedom win.
With blood this sacred stone besmear,
And bow your head in sacred fear.
Then cast the corpse into the pit,
And then this region you may quit.

The Rite of Escape
A group may only leave the region if they daub the altar
with blood, and cast a humanoid corpse into the cleft.
However, despite the allusions, the corpse need not be
freshly killed and the blood need not be drawn from
the same corpse.

284

The Battle of the Trees

0902

Uneven ground, riven with ditches, gullies, and rifts. Foul, purple vapours drift from the earth.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with a treowere (DMB), either Lawful or Chaotic
(see The Battle of the Trees).
Foraging: Successful foraging yields ruddy medlars
sufficient for 1d6 doses of Moonhaw (DPB), in addition
to the normal results.
Ley line Lamm (p18): Arcane spell-casters feel
observed by a pitiless malevolence.

The Battle of the Trees
As the adventurers struggle through the hex, they hear the
sound of a terrible ruckus. It sounds like falling trees and
the roaring of monsters.
Following the sound: Adventurers come upon an extraordinary scene: two groups of treoweres, each of different
appearance, fighting each other in a field of upturned
trunks and torn-up foliage. There are nearly two dozen
combatants on each side.
Chaotic treoweres: Bent, twisted, thorny, briar-ridden
trees who scream horridly as they fight. These have been
corrupted by Atanuwë (p45) and fight to drive the
Lawful treoweres from the area. They number 8 treoweres
and 16 animated trees.
Lawful treoweres: Appear as normal, if enormous, trees.
They put up a ferocious resistance to the Chaotic invaders.
They number 6 treoweres and 12 animated trees.
Intervening: If the adventurers enter the affray, tardy
though they may be, they might make the difference
between victory and defeat for one of the warring sides
(see Fighting the Battle).
Rewards: The Chaotic treoweres, if victorious, reward
any who aid them by issuing a personal invitation to the
Court of the Nag-Lord (hex 0904), so that Atanuwë may
reward them “personally.” The Lawful treoweres, should
they prevail, reward the adventurers for their aid with a
Arcane Shortbow (Chaos Bane, p412) made from a branch
of an old treowere who died long ago.

Fighting the Battle
If the party joins the battle, the Referee may resolve it
in one of the following ways.
Standard combat: Use the standard combat rules to
resolve the engagement of 14 treoweres, 28 animated
trees, and the PCs.
Abstract combat: Abstract the course of the battle into
a smaller engagement between the PCs and a small
number of opponents, as follows. If the adventurers
aid the Chaotic treoweres, they need only fight and
destroy a single Lawful treowere before the tide turns
and the Lawful treoweres are defeated and repulsed. If
they aid the Lawful treoweres, the PCs must defeat two
corrupted treoweres to repel the Chaotic force, though
they gain the aid of two formerly Chaotic animated
trees after defeating the first treowere.

285

0903

The Besieged Nodal

Boggy woods of wind-bent pine, riddled with small streams and islets. A purplish tinge pervades the air.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line Lamm (p18): Arcane spell-casters feel
observed by a pitiless malevolence.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 Shub Eggs
(p430), in addition to the normal results.

Tenkystone
At the centre of a sodden hollow, in a glade ringed with
elder, the nodal Tenkystone stands.
Appearance: Tenkystone is an obelisk of white, sandy
stone, 15′ tall, inlaid with silvery runes.
Guardians: The Audrune Jhaelloch and his wicker giant
(DMB) guard Tenkystone.
The siege: The Audrune and the stone are currently under
siege by a horde sent by the Nag-Lord two weeks ago. The
stone is attacked approximately one night in three. So far,
the Audrune has held off the attackers, but his defences are
precarious and could be toppled at any time.
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Word of Doom. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18
for details on learning this spell.
Touching the stone: Summons forth its power: a white
mist rises from the soil, enveloping all within 10′. All in the
mist must Save Versus Doom or perish. Any who survive
may ask a question about the future. The Referee should
answer each character’s question with what seems the
most likely course of events.

The Nag-Lord’s Horde
Lurking in the periphery of Tenkystone, harrying the
Audrune.
Daytime: 1d4 harpies (DMB) and 2d4 crookhorns (DMB)
lounging in the branches.
Nighttime: Creeping towards the nodal stone are 1d4
harpies (DMB), 3d4 crookhorns (DMB), and 1d4 harridans
(DMB).
Aim: To slay or drive away the Audrune and his wicker
giant, then to perform a binding ritual on Tenkystone,
bringing it under Atanuwë’s yoke.

Giant Trident
The harridans have speared a great seven-pronged trident
of pockmarked meteoric iron into the earth along the
course of Lamm, 200 yards south of Tenkystone.
Bleeding earth: Black ooze seeps from the “wound.”
Astral interference: The trident stymies Jhaelloch’s magic.

286

The Audrune Jhaelloch
A small, scrawny human man with greyish, wrinkled
skin, hawkish nose, and wan blue eyes. He dresses in
the traditional night-black cloak and hood of his order.
Currently wears a woollen scarf around his ears, to
block out the song of the harpies that assail him.
Demeanour (Neutral): Agitated, suspicious. Usually
taciturn, but will respond if engaged in conversation,
owing to his current predicament.
Speech: Penetrating rasp. Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: To break the siege on Tenkystone. To contact
his brethren for aid.
Bargain: Promises the gratitude of the Drune to any
who will help him defeat the horde or inform his
brethren of his plight. (Directs PCs to the Audrune
Hermanach in hex 0804.)
Combat stats: Audrune (DMB). Spells 50% likely to fail
when cast and unable to use ley travel (due to astral
interference from the Giant Trident).

The Court of the Nag-Lord

0904

Decrepit firs and twisted thorn trees, dripping with pink ooze. Clawed roots writhe and grasp at travellers.
Terrain: Thorny forest (4), Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with 2d10 vampire bats (DMB), bred by the Nag-Lord
to plague its domain.
Ley line crossing Hoad/Lamm: Arcane spell-casters
perceive the feeling of desperately awakening from a
nightmare. (See p18.)

The Court of the Nag-Lord
Perched on the steep northern shore of the rank, sluggish
River Shub sits the court of the Nag-Lord, Atanuwë. It takes
the form of a great, oozing dome of black slime, quivering
like a bubble drifting on water. A contorted, glistening
tower ascends 100′ from its centre, topped with a cluster
of gristly horns. A wall of venom-dripping thorns, 15′ high
and 15′ deep, rings the court.
Putrescent flow: A putrid, frothing liquid—black and
purple and horrid pink—drains from the base of the wall
of thorns and oozes into the River Shub. This is Atanuwë’s
corruption, which flows into Lake Longmere and thence
into the waters of all Dolmenwood.
Thorn wall: The wall is impenetrable and immune to
mundane damage. Scaling it is perilous: 2d8 damage plus
Save Versus Doom or die of poison.
Entrance: The thorn wall parts for any who bow low and
proclaim their servitude to Atanuwë, granting entrance
to the court.

Inside the Court
Within the slime dome, rubbery, black membranes form
intestine-like passages and womb-like chambers. The
only light is from the luminous secretions that weep from
pustules dotting the walls. Cries of anguish, the scents of
gore and sickly, otherworldly perfumes, and wicked, cackling laughter pervade.
Inhabitants: The Nag-Lord, Atanuwë (p45), 75 crookhorns (DMB), 12 harpies (DMB), 7 harridans (DMB), and 5
corrupt unicorns (DMB) are typically resident.
Visitors: Are likely to be imprisoned, tormented, and eaten
alive.
Throne room: A giant throne of pale, twisted wood stands
before the captured nodal Sargstone, surrounded by feasting tables piled with entrails, rotting fruits, and roasted
children’s flesh. The Head of the Stag Lord hangs above the
throne and the antlered staff the Drune call the Awlflame
(an Arcane Staff / Staff of Dominion (Humans)) lies on a table
nearby—used by Atanuwë as a toothpick.
Sargstone: Sargstone—known as the Weirdstone—is a 15′
tall obsidian pyramid, its surface flickering with maelstroms of purple energy. Amid the energy, the agonised
visage of a man can be seen (the trapped spirit of the
Audrune Hemlack—the stone’s former guardian). Touching Sargstone is deadly: Save Versus Doom or disintegrate.
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Dweomerfire. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18
for details on learning this spell.

The Head of the Stag Lord
The decapitated head of the Wood God Yorghan (see
p39 and hex 1305), with antlers spanning 8′, its great
tongue drooling and its eyes rolling vacantly.
Drool: Consuming the head’s frothy drool cures 1d6+1
HP. (Once per day per character.)
Gaze: Speaking the Stag Lord’s name (Yorghan) causes
the eyes to focus briefly. One who meets its gaze must
Save Versus Doom or dissolve into a pool of plasma and
evaporate in 1d6 Rounds. A character who makes the
save is cured of all curses and diseases afflicting them
and gains 1d4 Constitution. (Once ever per character.)
Freeing the trapped Audrune: The spirit of Hemlack can be
released into another vessel by magic of soul transference
such as Trap the Soul (p457).
Ballroom: A 100′ wide disc of solidified darkness floating
at the top of the dome. Harpies, corrupted woodgrues, and
crookhorns play a continuous, maddening din. The skulls
of four saints drift around, wailing sanctimoniously (much
to the amusement of Atanuwë and its minions).
Cellars and pantries: Beneath the court, an endless
maze of frigid chambers houses an exquisite selection of
crushed-sprite wines, human children, and other prisoners whose destiny awaits on the Nag-Lord’s feasting tables.
Atanuwë’s chambers: A stair of human bone ascends the
central tower to Atanuwë’s private chambers, overlooking the Valley of Wise Beasts. Amid heaps of offal and silk
cushions can be found jewels to the value of 20,000gp,
depraved statues and art objects to the value of 20,000gp,
a shimmering pool of liquid gold (20,000gp worth, if solidified), and an assortment of discarded magical playthings:
Belt of Might (p406), Horn of Blasting (p408), Talisman

(p400), and an Arcane Shield (Freezing, p400).

The Mouse Shrine and the Hermitage
Broken boughs and carelessly felled trunks. Crookhorn hoof-prints traipse throughout.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Valley of Wise Beasts
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with a patrol of 2d6 crookhorns (DMB) from the
garrison at Baron Fragglehorn’s tower (hex 1004). They
patrol down into the Valley from the tower, meting out
terrible and anarchic justice. They attempt to arrest
outsiders and bring them before the Baron.
Ley line Lamm (p18): Arcane spell-casters feel
observed by a pitiless malevolence.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions of
Worm-Mallow (p430), in addition to the normal results.

The Valley of Wise Beasts
A mile wide here, the Valley of Wise Beasts dwindles away
toward the south-west of this hex, the cliffs that bound it
gradually diminishing in height. The western end of the
Valley, in this hex, is composed of wild forest and is scantly
inhabited.

The Shrine to St Vinicus
Upon the verge of the southern cliffs, a well-maintained,
miniature church, complete with steeple, sits overlooking
the Valley of Wise Beasts. Next to it is a pathway along the
cliff edge, leading to the Hermitage.
Door: The building’s oaken door is beautifully carved with
a diorama of mice and shrews floating on barges around a
flooded church. It is locked.
Interior: Rear windows reveal a picturesque view of the
valley below. Between them stands a statue of a man smiling benevolently—Saint Vinicus, patron saint of mice and
beggars. Three separate nooses hang about his neck. Upon
the altar at his feet stands a foot-high, silver Chapes holy
symbol (500gp).
Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of
St Vinicus: the ability to cast Animal Growth. See Shrines,
p22.

Hermitage
A tidy pathway beside the shrine leads 100 yards along the
cliff edge to a clearing containing a thatch-roofed hut and
a pile of neatly stacked firewood. Atop the hut is a grisly
sight: a decapitated human head rests at the roof’s apex,
its blood staining the thatch.
Occupant: The entire space inside the hut is occupied by
the bulk of a mogglewomp (DMB). This creature slew the
owner of the hut, a friar who lived here as a hermit and had
restored the shrine.
Contents: If the beast can be dislodged from its appropriated lair, the friar’s possessions can be retrieved, including the key to the shrine, a set of antique religious books
(200gp), and a map of Lake Longmere with “Lost shrine to
Saint Galaunt?” annotated in red, close to the south-western bank.

The Ruined Abbey of St Clewyd

0906

Sighing wind seems to emanate from face-like formations in the sides of ragged granite peaks.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with the gloam (DMB) that lairs in the abbey ruins.
Ley line Lamm (p18): Arcane spell-casters feel
observed by a pitiless malevolence.

The Ruined Abbey of St Clewyd
Close to where Swinney Road crosses the turreted Chantilope Bridge, a cobblestoned avenue diverges. Overgrown
and flanked with defaced saintly statues, it leads to the
shattered gate of the ruined abbey complex.
Chaotic phenomena: Manifest among the ruins: prismatic, spectral flames; iridescent lights drifting and
bobbing; erratic booming from underground; twitching
ears and whispering mouths sprouting from stone.
Haunted bell tower: A tall, square tower stands largely
undamaged, close to the toppled gate. Dark birds roost
in the belfry at the tower’s summit. A gloam haunts this
place, dwelling with three charmed children.
Chapel of St Clewyd: The main chapel is damaged but
largely intact. A tapestry of climbing plants conceals a
series of mosaics depicting the life and deeds of St Clewyd.
Twin staircases descend to the chapel’s crypts.
Disturbed graveyard: The graves of several hundred
monks, surrounded by buckling, ivy-covered walls. The
newest graves bear dates just over 100 years ago. Many
have been carelessly dug up. There is a 2-in-6 chance of a
charmed child being present here, digging.

Inside the Bell Tower
Ground floor (chapel): A decaying chapel dedicated to St
Woad, patron of bakers, bears, and hammersmiths.
1st floor (bedroom): The home of the three charmed
children, living among the ramshackle remnants of the
former gatewarden’s residence.
2nd floor (bell-ringing chamber): Macabre dioramas of
stuffed woodland creatures with human teeth glued into
their mouths, strung from the bell ropes. Disturbing the
figures risks the wrath of the gloam that lurks in the belfry.
3rd floor (belfry): A great bronze bell (1,500gp). The gloam
(DMB), “Mister Rag-n-Bone,” perches in flock form among
the rafters, filling the chamber with eerie shadows.

The Chapel Crypts
An extensive series of tombs and catacombs extends
beneath the chapel. The doors from the surface lead into
a vast undercroft in the eastern half of the crypts.
Chaos Rift: The eastern crypts are wracked with Chaotic
energies and monsters, emanating from the dimensional
rift caused by the ritual that brought about the abbey’s
destruction (see History, p14).
The Order of Wardens: The western crypts, free of the Rift’s
influence, are home to 50 monks—20 living, 30 undead.
They have dwelt here since the abbey’s destruction, magically walling themselves in, swearing to remain until their
“Charge” can be healed.
Holy magic: Provides sustenance for the monks, and resurrects those who pass away. The latter power has sometimes misfired, causing some monks to return as mindless
undead (cared for by the living monks).
The “Charge”: A wretched monstrosity formed of the
amalgamation of St Clewyd and Sallowbryg (see History,
p14). The beast is imprisoned, its mind shattered and
hateful of all life.

Charmed Human Children

Mister Rag-n-Bone (Gloam)

Three children live in the bell tower, in the gloam’s
thrall, tasked with digging up teeth from the graveyard.

Flock form: A swirling, noisome gyre of shrieking,
decayed crows. Humanoid form: A gangly, pulsing
agglomeration of tiny, broken bones, wearing a cloak
of rancid feathers.

Bilbry Worms: A waif-like, blonde boy of 5 years.
Willy Hodgeheg: A strapping lad of 8 years, whose
matted black hair cascades over his glowering eyes.
Violet Harrowmoor: A dark-haired girl of 6 whose dress
and speech betray her aristocratic origins—she is the
missing daughter of Lady Harrowmoor (p60). The
gloam charmed her away from behind her mother’s
back on a visit to the fortifications at Prigwort (p181).

Demeanour (Neutral): Erratic, withdrawn, obsessive.
Speech: Grating whisper, clacking of beaks. Woldish.
Desires: Obsessed with creating taxidermied animals
with the teeth of the devoutly religious (dug up by the
children, in the abbey graveyard) carefully sewn into
their jaws. Protect and nurture the foster children.

289

0907

Bafflestone

Dismal, pathless woods; knotted roots and tangled boughs. Grisly, rasping moans punctuate the silence.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 3-in-6 likely to
be with 2d10 wandering Bafflestone Thralls.
Ley line crossing Lamm/Ywyr: Arcane spell-casters
perceive an incessant, spiralling wailing, as if a gateway
to the realm of the dead were nearby.

Enfeebling Emanations
Travellers within this hex are assailed by nausea, confusion, and unease, emanating from a malignant presence
that can be sensed at the centre of the hex.
Effects: Living creatures suffer a –1 penalty to Attack Rolls
and Saving Throws while in this hex.
Locating the source: The source of the emanations—the
broken nodal Bafflestone—can easily be located by heading towards the sensed malignant presence.

Bafflestone
Those who arrive at the centre of the hex enter a shadowy, silent glade, wherein an ancient and forbidding nodal
stone looms over dead grass. It is known to the Drune, its
creators, as Bafflestone.
Appearance: The stone is an irregular, blocky prism of
deepest red carnelian, about 8′ tall and 3′ wide, with a
smoke-like vein of black crystal residing at its core.
All who view Bafflestone: Must Save Versus Spell or fall
under its thrall (see Consequences of Bafflestone Exposure).

Consequences of Bafflestone Exposure
Those who fail to resist the Bafflestone’s power become
sympathetic to the stone’s deep malignity.
Initial symptoms: Unable to sleep, unwilling to leave
the stone’s presence without physical coercion, and
unwilling to eat or drink, despite hunger and thirst.

Examining: Close examination of Bafflestone’s surface
reveals minutely carved Drunic sigils, repeating the
phrase: “Bafflestone, Hand of Drune, Nexus of Lamm and
Ywyr.”

Undead thralldom: Unless dragged, pulled, or otherwise coerced at least 1 mile away from the stone within
8 hours, those enthralled wither and die, remaining on
this plane as morose and disconsolate undead wanderers: Bafflestone Thralls.

Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Glyph of Locking. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18
for details on learning this spell.

Bafflestone Thralls

Corruption: Bafflestone was irrevocably warped by a
pernicious ley resonance set up by Atanuwë, emanating
from the captured nodal Sargstone. The stone’s inner magical structure erupted with a grievous and invisible wound
that the Drune—much to their shame—were unable to
staunch.

Desiccated corpses that patrol the environs of Bafflestone without rest, seeking to drag outsiders to the site
of the stone to test their wills against the monument’s
eldritch presence.
Medium Undead—Mindless—Chaotic

Level 2 AC 11 HP 2d8 (9) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att Claw (+1, 1d4 + grasp) Speed 30 Morale 12 XP 35
Undead: Silent before attacking. Immune to biological
effects (e.g. disease, poison) and mind-affecting spells
(e.g. Vapours of Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).
Gang up: Groups of 3–4 thralls attempt to surround
an individual victim to subdue them and drag them
to Bafflestone.
Grasp: The thrall grabs onto the victim and only lets go
if killed. The victim suffers a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls
and AC. This penalty is cumulative if multiple thralls
grasp the same victim. A victim grappled by 3 or more
thralls is helpless (cannot attack, move, or act in any
way) and is dragged towards Bafflestone.

The Hag’s Lair

0908

A confusing tangle of marshy waterways, peat bogs, and mud holes. Weirdly babbling bog-lights flicker.
Terrain: Swamp (4), Hag’s Addle
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Nighttime encounters are
2-in-6 likely to be with the Hag (p82).
Ley line Lamm (p18): Arcane spell-casters feel
observed by a pitiless malevolence.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d6 portions of
Bloodcap (p428) or 1d4 portions of Grinning Jenny
(p428), in addition to the normal results.

The Soul Pond
Close to the northern edge of this hex, amid the maze of
streams and rivulets seeping into the River Hameth, is a
broad, marshy pool veiled in a chill, greenish mist. The
pool’s waters are oily black whorled with vivid mauve.
Phantoms: If PCs approach, grisly heads and grasping
hands form in the mist, gliding above the waters towards
intruders. They brush against characters’ cheeks and dissipate harmlessly.
Bathing: One who braves the phantoms and bathes in the
oily waters is blessed with the ability to levitate for 1d6
hours.

The Hag’s Hut (Hidden)
In the deeps of the swamps on the southern banks, travellers may come across a simple reed-thatched wooden
shack with a single door and no windows. This is the home
of the Hag (p82).
Re-locating: The hut vanishes and reappears at dawn each
day, moving from place to place with a will of its own.
Locating it requires characters to search anew with every
visit to the hex (see Travel, DPB).
By day: The hut sits astride a hummock or other dry patch
of ground amid a swampy pool or mire.
By night: The hut floats 10′ above the surface of the gnatplagued fen.
Entering: The door is not locked. The Hag gains an immediate awareness of intruders and, if elsewhere, rushes back
to the hut, arriving within 1 Turn.

Inside the Hut
Characters entering unbidden find the hut bare and unoccupied. Only those invited by the Hag (or those who can
see through illusions) perceive the hut’s true interior: a
jumble of rude baskets, jars, and pots, with drying herbs
hanging from the rafters and gnarled candles sputtering
upon every surface. Green and orange flames flicker in a
fireplace at one side, heating a great cauldron. In a corner,
a reeking bundle of furs and rags serves as a bed.
The Hag: Broods in the hut during the day, fulfilling her
accursed duty of guarding the Door to Fairy. At night, she
wanders the marsh, foraging for herbs or victims.
The cauldron: A stew of questionable meats (some identifiable as humanoid), bubbling away.

Candles: Anguished faces can be seen in the weirdly
twisted wax of some of the candles. These are the last
remnants of charmed victims of the Hag.
The fireplace: A door to Fairy, during the day (see below).
Grimalkin guards: 5 large black cats (actually grimalkins
charmed to remain forever in chester—see the DMB) lurk
in the rafters, eyeing guests greedily. They pounce on troublemakers; anyone damaged by them must Save Versus
Spell or be afflicted with the nightly urge to drown themselves in the bog (Wisdom Check per night to avoid).

Door to Fairy
During the day, the Hag’s fireplace acts as a door to Absynthe, Fairy domain of her sister, the Queen of Blackbirds
(p35). The Hag is eternally bound as guardian to this
door, even though she herself cannot cross its threshold.
Entering: Adventurers with an invitation from the Queen
of Blackbirds may step past the cauldron, through the
flames (which are harmless), and be transported to the
fairy realm of Absynthe. The door allows entrance; there
is no way back. (The Hag may have knowledge—albeit
dated—of other routes of escape from her sister’s realm.)
On the other side: Characters appear amid a copse of
forlorn pines upon an island in a gloomy lake. Ravens’
calls pierce the frigid air, bringing word to the Queen that
intruders have stepped through the Hag’s portal.

Journeys Into Fairy (Optional)
Referees wishing to expand play into the realm of
Absynthe may allow adventurers to enter the Hag’s
portal without an invitation. This requires the Referee
to develop adventure locales of their own in Absynthe.

0909

The Worm’s Pit
Blackened and charred trees. A perpetual light haze smells of smoke.

Terrain: Craggy forest (4), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Ley line Lamm (p18): Arcane spell-casters feel
observed by a pitiless malevolence.

The Blistered Woods
This section of the forest appears to have recently been
ravaged by fire. Trees are blackened and charred, stripped
of leaves. The ground is hardened dirt, with little undergrowth. A light haze with the odour of smoke fills the air,
lightly obscuring one’s vision.
The curse: The Blistered Woods has manifested due to the
presence of the Worm, slowly growing in scope each year
it has resided in The Pit. Slaying the Worm causes the haze
to lift and the forest to begin to heal.

The Pit
At the dead centre of the Blistered Woods is a clearing
containing a circular pit, 30′ in diameter.
Darkness: Starting 10′ below its opening, the pit is
immersed in a supernatural darkness. Anything thrown
into the pit, including light sources, falls 10′ and then disappears.
Inhabitant: The pit is home to the Worm, who telepathically detects any who approach, while concealing itself
within the darkness.
Questions: After taking a moment to read the PCs’ minds,
the Worm telepathically communicates with one or more
of them. It can communicate simultaneously with as many
people as it wishes, depending on whom it feels will be
most interesting or amusing.
Tribute: The Worm offers knowledge, but demands tribute
in exchange. It cares more about the worth of the tribute
to the questioner than its strict material value. It accepts
sacrifices, treasure, and even important memories (which
it scours from the questioner’s mind).
Knowledge: The Worm only knows disconnected facts,
gleaned from previous visitors and victims. It primarily
relies on reading the thoughts of questioners to provide
answers they want to hear. If any members of the questioning party are keeping secrets from each other, it reveals
them to deliberately cause chaos.

Inside the Pit
The pit is 60′ deep, with earthen walls. It does not appear to
be naturally occurring. Inside, light only reaches 10′ from
its source (see Darkness).
Bottom: The bottom of the pit is a mass of junk and bones,
both animal and humanoid.
Treasure: Scattered amongst the debris is a mess of coins
(426cp, 708sp, 694gp), 12 silver bangles adorned with hanging owls (35gp each), and a ruby-encrusted Holy Shortsword
(p412) that can produce the effects of the holy spell
Locate Object once a day when coated in blood.

292

The Worm
An enormous, 40′-long earthworm with transparent,
veiny skin and a lamprey mouth full of jagged teeth.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Gruff, affecting mystery.
Haughty but tries to conceal it. Demands tribute but
acts as if it is always the more generous party in any
exchange.
Speech: Low, confident. Communicates telepathically
within 120′, in the listener’s preferred language.
Desires: To amuse itself. To feel powerful. To feed. To
be entertained or flattered through tribute.
Large Bug—Sentient—Chaotic

Level 9 AC 16 HP 40 Saves D7 R8 H9 B10 S11
Att Slam (+7, 1d10) and bite (+7, 1d10 + swallow)
Speed 20 Morale 9 XP 1,350
Mind-probing: Can probe surface thoughts of all
within 120′, or probe deeper thoughts and memories
by concentrating on a specific creature within range.
Swallow: A bite Attack Roll of 4 or more than the target
number required indicates the victim is swallowed.
Swallowed victims can attack the worm from inside,
but must Save Versus Hold each Round or be paralysed
for as long as they remain inside the worm (aware but
unable to move or act). The worm digests food incredibly slowly, dehydration killing victims long before
they’re properly dissolved.

Golokstone

0910

Old, thick-boled trees creak and groan. The soil is orange, as if soaked with blood.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Off-road encounters are 2-in-6
likely to be with 1d3+1 bramblings patrolling the region.
Ley line Lamm (p18): Arcane spell-casters feel
observed by a pitiless malevolence.

The Jaunty Horn (Inn)
A high-gabled inn that spans the Ditchway, bridge-like.
At the rear, a wide yard and stables bustle with caravans.
Sign: A curled bugle with a portrait of Lord Ramius (p65)
engraved at its head. (The folk of the inn are Ramius loyalists, proudly retaining his portrait on the sign.)
Common room: A broad, low-beamed space rammed
with round tables, with hundreds of horseshoes cladding
the walls. The proprietor Jesibelle Nag and her husband
Mollish serve tables while their 7 children run and play.
A 6′-long drinking horn hangs above the bar—downing a
whole horn is a challenge the locals use to settle disputes.
Guests: Common travellers, merchants, and surly guards.

Services at the Jaunty Horn
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB).
6′ of ale: 4 pints of Keye’s Balm (DPB) in the horn. 4sp.

Golokstone
A 10′ square slab of yellow sandstone, split down the
middle, lies at the centre of a glade of lofty silver birches,
surrounded by a maze of circuitous paths.
Guardians: The Audrune Aethogrym, along with 7 bramblings (DMB) that roam the hex.
Fungal ring: Dense patches of scarlet, 2′ high toadstools
encircle the stone; they release a 20′ diameter cloud of
spores if anyone approaches. All within must Save Versus
Blast or experience vivid, religiously-tinged hallucinations for 1d6 Turns (–4 penalty to Attack Rolls and cannot
cast spells). Aethogrym and his bramblings arrive after 1
Turn to evict the intruders.
Inscriptions: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Arcane Eye in addition to the inscription “Scry, Drune,
all Dolmenwood spread wide. Speak, Drune, voice of the
Aegis.” See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18 for
details on learning the spell.
Peering into the split slab: Reveals an impossibly fathomless vista of swirling black and purple mists dotted with
glinting points of silver, like stars.
Scrying: Casting Crystal Vision or Arcane Eye while gazing
into the vista brings about a trance, lasting for 1 Turn,
wherein the spell-caster has a vision of Dolmenwood in
its entirety and may choose to zoom into any one hex,
gaining an insight into the hidden features there.
Drunic speech: Uttering Drunic words into the vista opens
a channel of communion to the Drune Aegis (p54).

Jesibelle Nag—Jaunty Horn Proprietor
(Level 4 Fighter)
A stout, muscular human woman in her late thirties,
with a knotted brow and a wide, gurning face. Dresses
in sheepskin jerkins, striped pantaloons, and purple felt
boots, always leaving her heavily bangled arms bare.
Jesibelle is a retired fighter who bought the Jaunty Horn
with the profits from her adventures.
Demeanour (Lawful): Boastful and belligerent, but
unerringly loyal to those who earn her respect.
Speech: Brash. Woldish.
Desires: To best tough-looking warrior types in bouts
of arm-wrestling or drinking contests. To experience
the thrill of adventure “one last time.”
Possessions: Purple felt Boots of Weft-Striding (p406).
A golden Holy Mace (p412) concealed behind the bar.

The Audrune Aethogrym
A towering (6′6″) human man of robust build, with
shaven head and staring eyes as pale as moonlight.
Wears a brass ring through his nose and dresses in the
traditional night-black cloak and hood of his order. As
guardian of Golokstone, Aethogrym is charged with
deterring intruders, but favours words over violence.
Demeanour (Neutral): Temperate, genial but stern.
Speech: Slow, hearty rumble. Woldish, Caprice, Drunic.
Desires: To defend Golokstone at all costs. To track
down the fairy who spies on his daughter Pollith (see
810) and ensure that he does not continue to do so.
Possessions: A bone bracelet, carved with mushrooms,
which allows him to sense intruders at Golokstone and
teleport to the vicinity.
Combat stats: Audrune (DMB).

0911

Shub’s Nanna
Round, moss-covered, waist-high boulders, like a chain of islands in a verdant sea.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line Lamm (p18): Arcane spell-casters feel
observed by a pitiless malevolence.

The Crooked Cottage
Beside a rushing brook of dark water is an ancient cottage
of moss-covered brick. The one-and-a-half-storey structure is an assemblage of crooked angles, jutting gables,
oddly-placed cupolas, and grimy, opaque windows. It is the
dwelling of the longhorn crone known in local folklore as
Shub’s Nanna (p47) and her henchfolk.
Sleigh: Beside the cottage is an unoccupied sleigh,
bedecked with deerskins. If touched by one other than its
mistress, the sleigh shakes and screams. (See p47 for a
description of the sleigh’s powers.)
Goats: 5 silver-eyed she-goats graze the bracken of the
surrounding woods. Shub’s Nanna uses these animals to
drive the sleigh.
Interior: A quaint, rustic kitchen and living room, stuffed
with drying herbs, pickle jars, baskets of root vegetables,
and human bones. Concealed behind a loose hearthstone
are a pouch of 1,560sp, a Wand of Fear, a vial of Philtre of
the Winds (p414), and 2 unicorn horn bracelets (1,000gp
each).
Inhabitants: Nanna’s servants—7 silver goblins—dozing
in hammocks in the attic. There is a 3-in-6 chance of Nanna
herself being at home (otherwise she is foraging in the
woods of this hex).

Silver Goblins
Lithe, hairless, silver-skinned goblins kidnapped from
Fairy and charmed into service by Atanuwë. Shun
clothing, apart from little cloth caps.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Merry capering, flashes of
deranged violence.
Speech: Mewling and snarling. Woldish, Sylvan.

The Shrine to St Thorm (Hidden)
In the south of the hex stands a ruined church surrounded
by a pile of crusted black filth that resembles a slime
mould. The church is overgrown with ivy and home to a
venerable colony of rooks, whose caws can be heard from
some distance away.
Consuming the filth: Non-humanoid mammals permanently gain human-like sentience after 1d3 days. (Animals
in these parts instinctively avoid the substance.) Mortals,
fairies, and demi-fey enjoy the substance’s delectable taste
but must immediately Save Versus Spell. Those who fail
fall into a coma for 1d3 days, during which they dream
incessantly of talking animals tormenting them with
degrading insults.
Church interior: The icon and relics in the chapel are
missing, but the epithets (in Liturgic) carved around the
doorway indicate that this place was once dedicated to St
Thorm “faith-smith.”
Prayer: If the shrine is re-sanctified by placing a holy
symbol upon the altar, characters praying may receive
the blessing of St Thorm: the ability to cast Detect Magic.
See Shrines, p22.

The Hamlet of Swinescombe

0912

A bucolic idyll of green pastures and verdant orchards, dotted with old windmills and fields of oats and barley.
Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6
Ley line Lamm (p18): Arcane spell-casters feel
observed by a pitiless malevolence.

Nearing Swinescombe
Nestled by the forest, in the north of the hex, the inviting
hamlet of Swinescombe presents a quaint image from a
distance. The sound of a lively lute or fiddle often greets
travellers approaching the thatched-roof farmhouses and
charming crimson barns.
Outlying farms: Farms surround the hamlet, with large
pig-pens in which fat shapes waddle with a faintly uncanny
motion. As one gets closer, it becomes apparent that the
creatures snuffling for food are not swine but bestial
humans (30 in all), naked and mud-spattered, fattened
and unshorn. Tending to the herds are pigfolk farmers.
See The Secret of Swinescombe.

The Hamlet of Swinescombe
Inhabitants: The hamlet is home to 30 pigfolk and 30
bestial humans. See The Secret of Swinescombe.
Visitors: Adventurers who try to interrupt Swinescombe’s
way of life are attacked by 6 pigfolk, who try to beat them
unconscious and bind them. Subdued PCs awake in the
pens, naked and in hog hobbles.
Slaughterhouse: Human corpses hang from the rafters,
dismembered body parts are strewn across work-tables,
and cleaver-wielding pigfolk cheerfully disjoint cadavers.
The Pot-Bellied Boar (alehouse): The village drunk, Old
Bart, habitually drowns his sorrows at the bar.
Abandoned building: Blockish, windowless. Conspicuously shunned by the pigfolk, who refer to it in quavering
whispers as the “haunted tomb of the ancestors.” The dark,
cool interior proves to be a curing larder for pork sausages,
which dangle from numerous hooks. Anyone fleeing here
is safe from the pigfolk.

Services in Swinescombe
Lodgings: Of common quality (DPB). No private rooms
are available.

The Secret of Swinescombe
Swinescombe was originally a hamlet of pig-farming
humans. By chance, a local charcutier discovered the
black filth in hex 0911. Believing it magical, he fed it to
the pigs, in a bid to outdo the famed bog-swine sausage
of Dreg (p140). The filth permeated the hamlet’s food
chain, eventually transforming its pigs into sentient,
anthropomorphic pigfolk and its humans into dull-witted beasts. The pigfolk appropriated the homes and
lives of the former farmers, herding the bestial humans.
Having only recently seized control of Swinescombe,
the pigfolk are anxious to prevent word of their situation from reaching the outside world. They bribed
Baron Hogwarsh’s tax collectors to let them be, but fear
their inevitable return.

Pigfolk
Walking, talking pigs dressed in fine peasant garb and
wigs of human hair, chattering in Woldish.
Medium Mortal—Sentient—Any Alignment

Food: Served at the Pot-Bellied Boar. Of common quality (DPB). All meat served is human.

Terrified of sausages: Pigfolk can be kept at bay (10′) by
brandished sausages, though they repeatedly warn this
will bring “the wrath of the ancestors” down upon the
entire hamlet “any minute now.”

An old, sad-faced male boar with ale-tinted whiskers
ringing a gin-blossomed snout.
Demeanour (Neutral): Sour, gripey. Tells outsiders the
history of Swinescombe for a drink.
Speech: Slow and deliberate, punctuated with meditative, mournful sighs. Woldish.
Desires: Misses life as a mere pig, and longs to return
to the carefree days of old.

The Bogenwood
A rubbery, black weed, clustered with squeaking bladders, carpets the ground.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
(4-in-6 likely if travelling on Quaking Creek) to be with
1d2 bogen.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Foolscap (p428), in addition to the normal results.

Bogen Territory
Many fallen, battered, and bent timbers litter the slopes
above Quaking Creek, which bisects this hex. Barge-folk
travelling the creek know these wood piles to be the territorial markings of the bogen, hirsute, giant-like creatures
who dwell in mounds beneath the brush. The mariners
refer to this area as the Bogenwood.
Shrill whistling: Visitors are often startled by the distant,
shrill whistles of the bogen, meant to keep away intruders.
Attacks on strangers: Beleaguered by Atanuwë’s fell influence and murderous minions, the bogen loathe all outsiders. They take particular frustrated pleasure in hurling
rocks at boats travelling the creek.

Blood-Daubed Stakes
As adventurers traverse the southern portion of the hex,
they encounter trees with images of braying unicorn heads
and nine-pointed stars—symbols of Atanuwë (p45)—
daubed upon them in blood. At the centre of this region is
the Burial Pit.

Burial Pit
A glade carpeted with tree stumps and mulch, at the centre
of which is a natural, limestone pit, half-filled with brackish water. Once a burial site where the bogen would throw
the bones of their dead, the pit has been appropriated by
servants of the Nag-Lord.
Chaos minions: 2d4 crookhorns (DMB), clad in filthy
hooded robes, prowl the edge of the pit, agitating the dark
water with long staves. They are assisting in the gradual
conjuration of a horrible new servant—the Huorglein—
weaving flesh around centuries of bogen remains. One
crookhorn’s staff is encrusted with rubies, cut in odd
shapes that seem to change when viewed (worth 500gp).

The Huorglein
A great, scarlet, ogre-like being, 12′ tall, with the antlers
of a stag, the teeth of a shark, and the benign, unflinching eyes of a mortal man. Not fully-formed, it is still
missing large chunks of muscle mass in places, exposing blackened bone beneath.

Awakening the Huorglein: Any corpse falling into the
pit triggers the Huorglein’s premature awakening, and its
hulking, scarlet form emerges from the depths in a rage.
The Huorglein cuts a bloody swath towards the court of its
master (hex 0904), littering the branches and boughs of
Dolmenwood with the entrails of those whom it destroys.

Large Undead—Semi-Intelligent—Chaotic

Att 2 fists (+7, 1d8 + disease) and gore (+7, 1d10)
Speed 40 Morale 11 XP 1,840
Undead: Silent before attacking. Immune to biological
effects (e.g. disease, poison) and mind-affecting spells
(e.g. Vapours of Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).
Immunities: Only harmed by magic or magic weapons.
Disease: Anyone hit contracts a horrible rotting disease.
Magical healing is ineffective; natural healing is 10
times slower. The disease can only be removed by magic.
Howl (once a day): Servants of the Nag-Lord within
60′ are driven into a violent frenzy: +1 to Attack Rolls,
damage, and morale for 1 Turn.

296

Bogen
Dull-witted giants, about 8′ to 10′ tall, with thick, wavy
tresses covering their entire body, except for their birdlike, three-toed feet. They do not speak, but communicate with eerie whistles and sighs.
Large Mortal—Semi-Intelligent—Neutral

Level 8 AC 12 HP 8d8 (36) Saves D8 R9 H10 B11 S12

Hurl: A character hit by both fists in a single Round
is lifted up and tossed onto the ground (2d6 damage)
or another character within 30′ (another Attack Roll
required to hit, 2d6 damage to both).

The Belching Pools and Brinemere

1002

Rotting reeds; stinking, tarry pools. Drifting, yellowish fog. Belching periodically breaks the silence.
Terrain: Bog (3), Fever Marsh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Marshwick (DPB) or Horridwort (p430), in addition to
the normal results.

The Belching Pools
This hex is dotted with hot pools, bubbling yellow with
sulphur. The mud banks that surround them are prone to
belching, as gases rise from the earth.

Thorny Scrub
The south-eastern corner of the hex is carpeted up to kneeheight with a scrub of wiry, black-stemmed bushes covered
in vicious thorns. Passage is laborious and painful.
Carrion storks: The air is filled with the wretched cawing
of the hundreds of carrion storks that nest at the western
edge of Brinemere, protected by the thorn scrubs behind.
Lichen nests: The storks’ nests are clad with a violet lichen
known as Horridwort (p430). Collecting a portion of the
lichen requires fighting off 1d4 carrion storks.

Brinemere
At the centre of the thorny region lies the salt-sludge of
Brinemere. The surface of the lake is patched with a crust
of pure white salt crystals; its grey waters are lifeless and
offensively salty.

Carrion Storks
4′ tall, ragged, black-feathered storks that feed on
carrion, favouring succulent eyeballs. Except when
defending their nests, they are fearful of humanoids,
but may attack the vulnerable-looking, tempted by
fresh eyeballs.
Small Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral

Eye peck: On a natural 20 Attack Roll, the stork pecks
out and guzzles down an eyeball. Unless cured, a
one-eyed victim suffers a –1 penalty to missile Attack
Rolls.

1003

An Awful Black Slime
Everything is coated in a horrid, viscous, black slime. The place reeks of syrup.

Terrain: Thorny forest (4), Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with black tentacles (DMB).
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Grue’s Ear (DPB) and 1d2 portions of Goatman’s Goblet
(p428), in addition to the normal results.

The Black Slime
Thickly coats everything in this hex, from the muddy
ground to the leaves of the twisted, thorny trees to the
surface of the languid and putrid River Shub.
Odour: The slime is the source of the sickly, syrupy aroma
that permeates this stretch of wood.
Taste: An awful combination of acrid and syrupy sweet.
Only the strong of stomach can resist vomiting, after
touching this stuff to the tongue.
Sticky: The slime is oily and hard to wash off without soap.

Brain-Like Fruits
Twisted trees bearing the 6″, brain-like fruits known as
Shub Eggs (p430) are numerous throughout this hex. The
fruits bob and wobble, attached to the trees by rubbery
cords, covered in the slick of black slime.
Harvesting: The tree sighs; the cord oozes a pink goo. The
brain-fruit pulses gently for an hour, then goes still. Characters can harvest as many fruits in this hex as they wish.

The Shrine to St Faxis (Hidden)
A pool of the black slime has gathered in a hollow, a slimecoated Chapes holy symbol protruding at the centre.
The Chapes: Marks the summit of the erstwhile shrine to
St Faxis the penitent, now submerged in the pool of slime.
The shrine: A round building of stacked river stones, piled
to a point.
Inside: The stone altar remains in the centre of the single
chamber, but the relics and icons of the shrine were looted
long ago.
Prayer: If the shrine is recovered from the slime and a
statue of St Faxis placed upon the altar, characters praying
may receive the blessing of St Faxis: the ability to cast Circle
of Protection. See Shrines, p22.

298

Baron Fragglehorn’s Tower

1004

The wide, central region of the Valley of Wise Beasts. A region of rolling, wooded hillocks and springy grass.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Valley of Wise Beasts
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 3-in-6 likely
to be with a patrol of 2d6 crookhorns (DMB) from the
garrison at the Baron’s tower. They patrol down into the
Valley from the tower, meting out terrible and anarchic
justice. They attempt to arrest outsiders and bring them
before the Baron.
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.

The River Shiver
A broad, shallow river that trickles lazily over its bed of
pebbles.

Baron Fragglehorn’s Tower
A crooked tower stands atop a sandstone crag at the north
side of the Valley, looming over the river valley like a hawk
gazing down upon bunnies at play. This is the tower of
Baron Fragglehorn (p46), crookhorn warlord and sheriff.
Construction: A mishmash of styles: solid cut stone at
the wide base, stacked river rocks in the midsection, two
wooden turrets at the top. (The middle and upper floors
were piggybacked on top of the disused Shrine to St Goodenough.)
Cliff and stairs: A stair, carved into the sandstone cliffs,
leads up to the foot of the tower. At the summit of the stairway, a lopsided iron gate bars the way. It is guarded by 1d4
crookhorns (DMB).
Front door: The tower’s great, oaken front door is shielded
by a bent, slate-roofed porch. It is guarded by 1d4 crookhorns (DMB).

Inside the Tower
Ground floor: The dwelling place of the 30 crookhorns
under the Baron’s command. A stinking, dishevelled
common room. A poky bed chamber packed with crookhorn excrement and hammocks. A stairway leads down to
the Shrine to St Goodenough (now used as a cellar).

The Shrine to St Goodenough
The stairway from the common room descends to a vaulted
crypt with angelic statues along two walls.
Altar and statue of St Goodenough: An altar stands opposite the stairway. The cherry-wood statue of St Goodenough (a plump man cradling a corn dolly) is decked with
gore and the raw pelts of various animals.
Barrels: Casks of cheap ale stacked to one side.
Buckets: Wooden pails covered with damp cloths litter the
floor. They contain mixtures of raw meat, bones, fat, and
crookhorn excrement.
Prayer: If the altar is cleaned up, characters praying may
receive the blessing of St Goodenough: the ability to cast
Holy Fire. See Shrines, p22.

Middle floor: The Baron’s parlour. Plush leather furnishings, scratched up by unruly hooves and horns. A round
feasting table strewn with roast game, wine bottles (1d6
worth 50gp each), and maps. 1d3 slovenly crookhorn
women (unarmoured) lounging.
Left tower: The Baron’s bedchamber. Foetid opulence.
Dank silks and tapestries (worth 500gp if cleaned up).
Hidden in the rafters is a lead box containing 200pp and a
string of ametrine carved into skulls (1,000gp).
Right tower: The wives’ quarters. The Baron’s six crookhorn wives (see Middle Floor) sleep here, when not otherwise engaged.

1005

Shub’s Finger and Stirge Isle

Hushed oak woods. Birds and small mammals are markedly scarce. A periodic groaning can be heard.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 1d4 stirge-owls.

Shub’s Finger
Close to the western side of this hex, a small, rustic-looking
pathway forks off from Swinney Road and leads south into
the woods.
Signpost: At the junction stands an old wooden signpost
(known to local folk as “Shub’s finger”), propped up against
the stump of a dead elm.
Odd place names: The sign indicates a different imaginary destination each time PCs pass this way. The Referee
may invent something or roll 1d6: 1. The Devil’s Mill, 2.
Snablesby, 3. Court of the Warbelowe, 4. Snankton-by-Water, 5. Castle Wrackenbold, 6. Little Chittering.
Following the path: None of the indicated places exist; the
path simply leads into the deep woods of hex 1006.
Damaging the signpost: Amounts to naught; it reappears
intact the following morn.

Stirge Isle
The accursed isle of the stirge-owls wards the western
end of the Groaning Loch, at the point where it narrows,
feeding into Sinkhole Creek.
Appearance: 900 yards long, 100 yards wide. Steep, rocky
sides, 50′ high, slick with weeds. Topped with gloomy firs.
Stirge-owls: The isle is the nesting ground of 60 stirgeowls, 2d6 of which swoop down to attack trespassers upon
the isle or those who pass by at night.

The Isle in Springtime
In the springtime, the isle is frequented by night-boars
(stats as boars—DMB—but can only be harmed by magic
or magic weapons). These gelatinous grazers leave their
usual habitat in the near-astral to mate upon Stirge Isle.
Mating calls: The bellowing of the night-boars can be
heard for a mile around, at times spooking the stirge-owls.
Foraging: After the night-boars have courted, their sticky,
luminescent seminal fluid can be found dripping from
rocks and tree trunks. Characters successfully foraging
on Stirge Isle find 2d6 doses of the stuff—known as Frisk
(p426)—in addition to the normal foraging results.

The Groaning Loch
Dangerous waters: Fathomless, cold, and unquiet. Unpredictable currents, whirlpools, and the presence of kelpies (DMB) make navigation of the loch’s waters a perilous
undertaking; few boats are ever seen upon it.
Cliffs and caves: The Loch is bounded by forbidding, granite cliffs, 200 yards high. The cliffs at the Loch’s shallower
western end are pocked with deep caves. Waves lapping in
the gaping cave mouths cause the groaning sounds heard
throughout this hex.

300

The Shrine in the Cliffs (Hidden)
As one navigates the currents of the Groaning Loch just
beyond Stirge Isle, an overgrown ledge and the hint of a
ruined stairway descending to it may be seen close to the
summit of the southern cliff.
Hidden shrine: The thorn bushes on this ledge conceal
a grotto in which a shrine to St Hollyhock the jubilant is
located. The dilapidated wooden shrine is utterly overrun
with shrubbery, fungi, and bats, but the idol itself is intact.
Statue of St Hollyhock: 3′ tall, carved in black marble,
depicts the saint in bishop’s robes and mitre, smiling
beneficently and holding a hearty loaf in her hands.
Prayer: If the shrine is cleaned out, characters praying
may receive the blessing of St Hollyhock: the ability to cast
Flame Ward. See Shrines, p22.

Stirge-Owls
3′ tall, white owls with wickedly curved beaks and
moon-like eyes without pupils. They eat humanoid
flesh, especially favouring that of children and infants.
Small Monstrosity—Animal Int.—Chaotic

Level 1 AC 13 HP 1d8 (4) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att Beak (+0, 1d4) and 2 rending claws (+0, 1d3)
Fly 60 Morale 8 XP 15
When first damaged: A stirge-owl lets out a bone-chilling screech. The one who harmed it must Save Versus
Doom with a +2 bonus or be cursed: lose 1 point of
Wisdom per day, becoming wild and animalistic when
Wisdom reaches 2 or less. The curse can be reversed by
magic of curse removal or by drinking stirge-owl blood.
Devour flesh: Enter into a feeding frenzy, when left
undisturbed with a fresh kill. The corpse is stripped to
the bone within minutes.

The Witch Glade

1006

Paths navigate a series of granite outcroppings, with choked ravines below.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 1d4 witches (eyes of Limwdd—DMB) making
their way to the sacred glade.
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Lambent Stinkhorn (p428), in addition to the normal
results.

Where Men Dare Not Tread
The paths that lead to the centre of this hex are enchanted
such that only women may follow them to the end.
Men who come this way: Experience a feeling of unease,
as if being watched from the trees, growing to a palpable
dread accompanied by an uncomfortable itching upon the
face. Male holy spell-casters also hear laughter that grows
from a titter to a contemptuous cackle as they proceed.
Women who come this way: Perceive a deep thrum which,
after some time, may be intuited as the actual sound of the
growth of trees and plants.

The Sacred Glade
Close to the centre of this hex, along the path of the ley line
Ywyr, lies a peaceful glade surrounded by silvery-leafed
sycamores. The glade is sacred to the witches of Dolmenwood.
At the glade’s edge: The sense of dread among male party
members culminates in a wave of abject terror—they must
Save Versus Hold or flee for 1d6 Turns.
Entering: Men who set foot in the glade must Save Versus
Hold or be permanently transformed into a limbless,
misshapen worm-like creature of animalistic intelligence.
Even if the save is successful, the man’s flesh agonisingly
wells up into great lumps, causing a permanent disfiguration on the face. Witches or powerful holy magic (e.g.
Remove Curse) can reverse these afflictions.
The Locus of Limwdd: The Gwyrigon Limwdd the Quiet
Brother (p38) resides here, its giant body lying a mile
beneath the earth, like a seed awaiting the spring.
Contacting the Gwyrigon: The witches, upon occasion,
commune with the Gwyrigon here. A PC versed in the
rites of the witches—or other magicks of invocation or
communion—may be able to do the same.
Limwdd’s gift: Upon departing the glade, the female PC
with the highest Wisdom finds that any scars or blemishes
on her body have vanished.

1007

The Tower of Frost

Pastoral woods of willow and elm. Golden motes drift in the air, leading travellers south to the swamp.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Tower of Frost
A slender, partially collapsed tower stands in a glade of
twisted beech trees, encased in a scintillating rime which
seemingly holds the ruin in place. The windows of the
upper floor are entirely covered by sheets of ice.
Inhabitants: The tower is the recently adopted home of
an elf courtier, disguised by fairy magic as a human and
going by the name Lady Misthraine. She lives with her 4
servants (as Level 1 thieves—DMB, each carries 2d20pp)—
young human men, charmed into her service. The servants
are unaware of their mistress’s true nature or name (Lady
Frost-Dust-Shadow).
Ground floor (entry and main rooms): Double doors of
elegantly carved white willow wood lead into a wide hall
of cold, white stone. Doors lead from the hall to a dining
room, a kitchen, a larder, spartan servants’ quarters, and
a stairway to the second floor. During the day, 1d4 of the
servants remain in the tower, while the others are abroad,
carrying out their mistress’s command.
First floor (ruins): Entirely empty and in ruins; windblown
by an unceasing gust whipping through a large hole in the
wall. The stairway to the upper level is blocked by hunks
of ice. These are illusory and can be walked through, but
hold up against tactile inspection.

Second floor (the Lady’s chambers): Its windows occluded
by sheets of ice, the contents of the room are minimal: a
slab of ice decked with white furs; books, in High Elfish,
recounting the history of the Cold Prince’s dominion in
Dolmenwood and eventual exile; a small coffer with 100pp
and sixteen frosty quartz crystals (50gp each); several sets
of clothing (white silk dresses, wolf-fur cloaks).
Visitors: The servants admit PCs for an audience with the
Lady if she is present (3-in-6 chance); otherwise they refuse
entry. The Lady receives visitors in the dining room. She
attempts to charm any mortals, seeking information on
the Ring of Chell (p20). PCs with no useful information
are sent on their way.

Lady Misthraine (Lady Frost-Dust-Shadow)
A young woman, tall and slender, clad in white,
with eyes of cold blue and hair of silver. Fairy magic
completely disguises her as human, though animals are
sometimes (2-in-6) nervous in her presence. Presents
herself as Lady Misthraine, a human sorceress from a
distant realm, come to Dolmenwood to study its ley
lines. A trusted agent of the Cold Prince, she was sent
here via perilous, long-forgotten ways, to uncover the
means by which her liege’s kingdom is exiled.
Demeanour (Neutral): Dislikes mortals but tries to act
genial. Unsure of the social norms of Dolmenwood.
Speech: Stilted, circuitous. Woldish (with a noble
foreign accent), High Elfish, Sylvan.
Desires: To discover the locations of the standing
stones around Dwelmfurgh (the Summerstones) and
any weaknesses in the warding ring.
Combat stats: Elf courtier (DMB).
Possessions: A fairy silver Talisman of Spell Reflection
(p398—6 charges remaining).

302

The Flotsam Pools

1008

Willows hang over dreary swampland. The occasional sound of waves, as if an ocean were nearby.
Terrain: Swamp (4), Hag’s Addle
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Daytime encounters are 1-in-6
likely to be with Tekwell Onehorn.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Hag’s Tears (p430) and 1d2 portions of Marshwick
(DPB), in addition to the normal results.

Flotsam Pools
Scattered throughout this section of the swamp are small
pools of dark, brackish water. No apparent bottom to these
pools can be seen.
Chance of flooding: The pools are always swollen after
heavy rain; otherwise there is a 2-in-6 chance that they are
flooding when the PCs encounter them.
When flooded: A random PC must make a Dexterity Check
or plunge into one of the pools with a loud splash. Roll for
a random encounter, attracted by the noise.
Flotsam: When the pools flood, strange objects and
unknown species of fish (among them—inexplicably—
oceanic ones) sometimes wash up on the muddy banks.
Their true provenance is unknown.

Tekwell’s Hut
A rickety stilt house constructed from willow wood and
thatching stands alone in the south-east corner of the hex.
Inhabitant: Tekwell Onehorn, who has a 3-in-6 chance of
being present. If not, he is out travelling the swamp.
Interior: A sparse single room with mismatched wooden
walls and floors, where rot and water damage have been
cut away. Its furniture appears fashioned by someone of
below-average skill. Next to a reed bed is a large trunk
containing 380sp, 185cp, and dozens of small trinkets made
of semi-precious metals, all aquatic-themed (200gp total).
For sale: Tekwell has an assortment of oddities dredged
from the pools, which he is willing to sell. See Tekwell’s
Wares. Roll up to 4 times, ignoring duplicate results over 8.

Tekwell Onehorn
An elderly longhorn (DMB) fisherman with dirty white
fur and sickly yellow eyes. Wears a wide-brimmed straw
hat with a single large hole cut out for his left horn. The
right horn was broken off near the base and refuses to
regrow. Once a knight to the previous Lord Murkin, he
was banished years ago by the current Lord Murkin
(p65) for a perceived lack of loyalty.
Demeanour (Neutral): Cautious but agreeable if
approached respectfully. Has the social grace of someone who speaks with real people only a few times a year.
Doffs and dons his hat frequently.
Speech: Friendly drawl. Woldish, Caprice, Gaffe.
Desires: Useful and entertaining trinkets. To only have
short, pleasant interactions with people. For visitors to
stop asking if he’s secretly a banished prince. To avoid
The Hag (hex 0908).

Tekwell’s Wares (d12)
d12 Item
1–4 A thin, leathery fish with enormous teeth. Technically edible. (1gp)
5 A brown, bulbous anglerfish. While its light gland
is submerged in water, it produces a 10′ radius glow.

6 A 3′-long eel with a thin body and an enormous head.
Delicious if cooked properly. (10gp)
7 A sealed jar of water containing a bloated red fish
that explodes harmlessly if removed. (20gp)

holder experiences the sensation of drinking fresh
water. (50gp)
10 A tightly sealed copper locket stylised as a fish eye.
If pried open, it contains a lock of hair matching the
colour and texture of one of the PCs. (10gp)
11 A cursed bronze Ring of Water Walking in the shape
of a mermaid holding her own tail. If the wearer is
ever submerged in water, they must Save Versus
Spell or be compelled to stop moving and let themselves drown. (100gp)

eight hematite statuettes of fish-headed humanoids
(worth 50gp each). (20gp for the closed case)

The Anti-Prism

Patches of grey bushes, flowers, and skeletal trees stand out against the otherwise verdant forest.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encountered creatures or
people are 3-in-6 likely to be afflicted with the Grey
Blight.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Parson’s Gobble (p430), in addition to the normal
results.

The Anti-Prism
In the north-west of this hex, Harrid’s Path passes through
a region, half a mile in diameter, where all the colours of
the forest bleed away into monochrome. Trees are bare and
undergrowth is wilted. All sounds of nature are silenced,
save a low, pulsing hum.
Giant crystal: At the centre of the greyness, a giant,
transparent crystal juts 20′ from the earth. A psychedelic
mixture of colours swirls inside it, undulating like ink in
water.
Touching the prism: A character who touches the prism
must Save Versus Spell or contract the Grey Blight. An
arcane spell-caster who successfully saves gains an arcane
insight into the very nature of colour and the body, and
may copy the spell Transparency (p457) into a spell book.
Striking the prism: Beams of colour flash out towards the
attacker. They and anyone within 10′ of them must Save
Versus Ray or be struck by a beam and be afflicted with a
Coloured Heart.

The Coloured Heart
The opposite of the Grey Blight, this much rarer condition alters a victim’s personality based on the colour of
the beam that strikes them.
Effects: Roll 1d6 on the table below.
Cure: Magic of curse removal, keeping the victim in
complete darkness for 24 uninterrupted hours, or
afflicting them with the Grey Blight, in which case their
symptoms are replaced with those of that condition.

d6 Coloured Heart

304

Red—Anger. Infuriated by even the most minor
inconvenience. Any time the character is slighted in
any way, they must make a Charisma Check or turn
violent.
Orange—Overconfidence. Rushes headlong into any
danger that presents itself.
Yellow—Happiness. Filled with joy. Permanent
uncanny smile and laughter at inappropriate times.
Green—Disgust. Always feels sickened and is visibly
off put by anything unusual. Must make a Save
Versus Hold to keep any food down.
Blue—Sadness. The character only sees the worst
in any situation. Their followers must make daily
Morale Checks or depart.
Violet—Fear. Paranoid. The character automatically
fails any Morale Checks or Saving Throws against fear.

The Grey Blight
Victims of the colour-sapping powers of the Anti-Prism
have all colour drained from their bodies. They are dull,
emotionless husks of their former selves, unable to act
of their own will and easily suggestible. Locals refer to
this condition as the “Grey Blight.”
Afflicted people: Their entire bodies (including clothing and possessions) are grey. These poor souls are listless zombies, unwilling to speak, unable to do more
than sigh.
Afflicted animals and monsters: Furs, feathers, or skins
are completely grey. Appear lethargic and depressed;
even normally hostile beasts simply laze about.
Cure: Magic of curse removal, immersing the victim
in a rainbow, or afflicting them with a Coloured Heart,
in which case their symptoms are replaced with those
of that condition.

The House of the Harridwn

1010

Tall, sighing birches, bored with beetle holes. A profusion of busy ants and their mounds.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Crossroads and Signpost
At the crossroads of the Ditchway and Harrid’s Path, an
old signpost indicates: “N: Hag’s Addle, S: House of the
Harridwn (Inn), E: Dreg (Ferry), W: Lankshorn (Lankston).”

The House of the Harridwn (Inn)
About three miles along the narrow, lesser-used Harrid’s
Path, travellers come upon a small, homely inn standing
at the side of the trail. A meagre, forlorn barn adjoins it.
Sign: A horde of welcoming children in maroon livery.
Sole guests: The inn is little frequented; it is likely that
adventurers who enter are the only guests.
Common room: Cramped but cosy. In colder months, the
small ironwork hearth holds a roaring fire.
Bigger on the inside: The guest rooms are situated along a
winding hallway up a wonky, creaky stair. Curiously, there
are dozens of guest rooms, occupying far more space than
the inn’s apparent size, when viewed from outside.
Dead-end stair: The winding upper hallway ends at a
stairway leading up to a blank ceiling. Knocking causes a
hidden trapdoor to open, leading to the Hidden Bedroom.
Hidden bedroom: A gloomy attic space, long undisturbed.
A woman’s skeleton lies in a neatly made bed, strewn with
bundles of dried lavender and roses. If disturbed, the
witch’s spirit rises as a spectre (DMB). Slaying the spirit
puts an end to the inn’s odd magic and the hauntings.
Behind the barn: A glade of gravestones is found behind
the barn. Several bear the name Occland, but graves for
Tom, Mildred, and Greta Rumbelow are also present.
History: The inn was once the enchanted house of a powerful witch, Holstra Loom. When she died, her family interred
her in the Hidden Bedroom. The Rumbelow children (see
Nightly Hauntings) were slain by the witch’s spirit.

Nightly Hauntings
The guest rooms of the inn are haunted by the ghosts of
several children, who may be encountered during the
night (as the Referee wishes).
Tom Rumbelow: A small boy rolling marbles around.
Mildred Rumbelow: A coquettish, teenaged waif knocking
on doors, looking for “the witch room.”
Greta Rumbelow: An infant, failing repeatedly to climb
the stairs and bawling in frustration.

Services at the House of the Harridwn
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB). Only
one (tiny and quaintly appointed) private room is available; all other rooms are shared.
Specialities: Buttered currant buns for 3cp each; local
ale (“Hameth Foam”) for 1sp a pint.

The Shrine to St Ponch (Hidden)
In the north-west corner of the hex, 200 yards from the
Ditchway, a valley overgrown with towering nodules
of slimy black fungus conceals a shrine to St Ponch the
prudent, patron saint of whalers and castaways.
Black fungus: The fungus that dominates the valley is
known as Hob’s Lewd (p428). 3d6 portions of its psychoactive slime may be gathered here.
The shrine: A simple wooden porch (now rotten and slimy)
above the statue. The whole structure is submerged in the
mass of fungus.
Statue of St Ponch: A 2′ high statue of white marble, depicting the saint as an old bearded man, bedraggled with sea
foam and holding a whaling hook in one hand and a basket
of scones in the other.
Prayer: If the shrine is cleared, characters praying may
receive the blessing of St Ponch: the ability to cast Create
Food. See Shrines, p22.

Mallowyn and Trellayde Occland—Landladies
Nigh-identical elderly human sisters with bright blue
eyes and flowing, silver hair. Dressed in tidy knitwear.
Demeanour (Neutral): Welcoming but enigmatic. Eyes
twinkling with youthful mischief.
Speech: Shrill, wavering, punctuated with cackles.
Woldish.
Desires: Love to hear new songs and tales of daring. For
the witch in the Hidden Bedroom to be left in peace.
Knowledge: The landladies know of the inn’s History.
They are descendants of the witch. If asked about the
ghostly children, the landladies claim they are here
with another guest, Mr Rumbelow. They wish to draw
attention away from the Hidden Bedroom.

1011

Brydging Ring
Wild, pathless woods choked with brambles and knee-height, blue-flowered thistles.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Hogscap (DPB) or Prancing Mandrake (p430), in addition to the normal results.

Standing Stones
300 yards from the southern edge of this hex, through an
area overgrown with brambles, stands a ring of tall stones,
clad with white-leafed ivy.
Human remains: At the centre of the ring is a mound of
human remains—primarily bones, but possibly a fresher
corpse as well, rended limb from limb. No clothing or
equipment is to be found.
Examining the stones: Reveals weatherworn runes
beneath the ivy. They are in a language lost to the utmost
antiquity. If deciphered, the runes reveal litanies of praise
to nameless entities, detailing awful, gruesome rituals.
Cursed place: Locals know this place as Brydging Ring and
speak of it as a place accursed and bewitched.
Antler wraiths: The remains are those of captives regularly
sacrificed here by a group of 7 antler wraiths (DMB).

The Wraiths’ Hoard
Some way to the east of the standing stones, in a shadowed
glade, is an ominous boulder, under which lie buried the
clothing and possessions of the victims of the 7 antler
wraiths that haunt the stones. Digging under the boulder
summons the wraiths within 1 Turn.
Coins: 4,980cp, 1,023sp, 993gp.
Jewellery: A silver ring engraved with a wyrm (30gp);
a silver pendant shaped like a mermaid, with pearls for
breasts (1,400gp); a platinum locket with a portrait of Lord
Malbleat (400gp).
A belt of shining fish skin: A Belt of Blending (p406).

The Nymph Pool (Hidden)
A small pool of placid, pink-tinged water, hidden in a bramble-choked dell.
In spring and summer: Twelve nymph statues stand in
the water at the pool’s edge, depicted joyously splashing
on another. Bathing in the pool cures a magical affliction
(e.g. a curse, Ability Score loss, energy drain).
In autumn and winter: Twelve nymph statues stand in the
trees around the pool, depicted gazing mournfully at the
ground, their eyes pointedly averted from the pool. Bathing in the pool permanently halves a random Ability Score.
Limit of effects: Each character can only be affected by the
pool’s magic once per season.

306

Ancient Worm Tunnels

1012

Wildflower meadows dotted with teeming ponds. A hollow moaning sound drifts on the wind.
Terrain: Meadow (2), High Wold
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Colossal Tunnels
The wild grasslands of this hex are riddled with 20′ wide
holes, leading down to a network of tunnels running for
miles beneath the earth.
Peering in: The holes descend at a steep angle before levelling off, each leading to a winding, 20′ wide, circular tunnel.
The entrances are lined with grass, ferns, and mosses,
where sunlight penetrates. Deeper below, the tunnels are
bare, dug into the hard, clay soil.
Campsites: Signs of impromptu travellers’ campsites can
be found in many of the tunnels, just below the surface.
Exploring: The warm, echoing tunnels run for miles,
providing a means to traverse the whole hex below ground,
should a party wish to. PCs exploring the tunnels are likely
to come to the Grand Arboretum. The Referee may also roll
for one or more subterranean encounters, as PCs explore
(see Encounters in the Tunnels).
Origins: The tunnels were excavated by gargantuan worms
in ancient days lost to memory.

The Grand Arboretum
A 100′ deep sinkhole where the earth has collapsed into the
giant tunnels below, forming a cavern open to the surface.
At the base of the sinkhole, dense copses of trees grow in
the scintillating light, thriving on the black soil, rich with
ancient vermicast. Tunnels lead into the wider network
beneath this hex (see Colossal Tunnels).
Descent: The sinkhole’s sides are sheer, requiring specialised climbing equipment or skill.

Bronze Beans
1″ tree beans with wrinkled skin of shimmering bronze.
Worth 100gp each. The Shadow House in Castle Brackenwold (p133) has long sought these beans, and pays
for any retrieved. They pay 1,000gp for their location.
If eaten: Save Versus Doom or suffer 1d4 damage and
vomit violently for 1d6 Turns (unable to move or act).
If planted: A tree like those in the Grand Arboretum
sprouts from the earth and grows to full maturity over
the space of 1 Turn. There is a 1-in-6 chance of the tree
being sentient (as a treowere—DMB).

Trees: Great, rambling specimens with waxy, heart-shaped
leaves of emerald and midnight blue, and long, bean-like
seed pods. They are unlike any common species that grows
in Dolmenwood.
Seed pods: The brown beans inside the pods are edible,
with a flavour akin to waxy almonds. Characters foraging here can collect 1d4 fresh rations. One very short pod
contains 1d6 Bronze Beans.

1101

Houndmistress Mound
Tangled, twisted trees press in close, their shades of green and brown almost painfully vivid.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Nagwood
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 1d4 labourers and 1 guard (Level 1 fighter—
DMB) from the expedition based in hex 1201, surveying
the exterior of the Houndmistress Mound.

Fentifey Bridge
A wonky, decaying bridge spans Quaking Creek at a narrow
point beside a swirling pool.
Crossing: People and mounts can cross the bridge safely.
Vehicles have a 3-in-6 chance of collapsing it.

Houndmistress Mound
A burial mound sits in a large clearing at the south-eastern
edge of hex, in the shadow of gloomy, windswept hills of
the Table Downs.
Appearance: The mound is 60′ in diameter, composed of
dirt and stone, and covered in a black ivy that has a peculiar, oily sheen. It has a single stone entrance, partially
obscured by the ivy, above which is carved the snarling
visage of a bear—PCs versed in Wood God lore recognise it
as that of Orsath (p39), the ancient guardian of the dead.
The entrance is extremely narrow and requires characters
to turn side-on to enter the Reception Chamber.
Dogs become restless: As the party approaches the mound,
any dogs or wolves accompanying the PCs begin to act
strangely: sniffing, whining, and ignoring commands.
History: The mound is one of several created by prehistoric
inhabitants of the Table Downs (see also hexes 1201 and
1202). This one, a tomb of one of their chieftains, has been
corrupted by the energies of the Nagwood.

Reception Chamber
The mound entrance leads to a reception chamber with
walls of stone. The chamber takes up half of the mound.
Dog carvings: The walls are covered with carved images of
dogs leaping up at a nighttime sky. Some dogs appear to be
tearing away chunks of the sky in their jaws, while others
bury the chunks, which seem to bleed starlight.
Burial chamber door: A tall, smooth stone blocks the
entrance to the Burial Chamber.
Opening the door: Requires a combined Strength of 30 or
more. As soon as the stone is dislodged, any dogs or wolves
accompanying the party suddenly become berserk and
attack the PCs for 1d6 Rounds.

Skeletal Dogs
Small Undead—Mindless—Neutral

Level 1 AC 12 HP 1d8 (4) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att Bite (+0, 1d6) Speed 60 Morale 12 XP 10
Undead: Silent before attacking. Immune to biological
effects (e.g. disease, poison) and mind-affecting spells
(e.g. Vapours of Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).

308

Burial Chamber
The burial chamber takes up the other half of the mound.
Burial slab: At the chamber’s centre is a stone slab; carved
on either side of it are images of two hounds, facing one
another and baying.
Corpses: On the slab lies a partially mummified corpse
clad in the rich robes of a noblewoman. In its right hand,
the corpse clutches a whip, set with thorns. Curled near
the foot of the slab are the skeletons of several large dogs.
Entering the chamber: The corpse rises as a wight (DMB)
wielding the thorny whip (1d6 damage, 10′ range) and the
dog skeletons rise as 4 skeletal dogs. They attack the tomb’s
defilers and pursue any who flee up to the edge of the hex.
Treasures: Placed about the chamber are 12 bronze
shortswords (negligible worth), 12 silver dishes (50gp each),
and 12 gold bowls (100gp each), all engraved with images of
hounds and crowns. In a sealed earthen jar is a copper Ring
of Control (Animals, p410), engraved with wolf-like eyes.

Mudpots

1102

The lingering odour of rotting eggs and sporadic slurping of mud.
Terrain: Bog (3), Fever Marsh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with Old Ned.

Mudpots
Craters filled with pools of bubbling mud pockmark this
section of Fever Marsh. Most of the crater rims are only
a few feet tall, but some reach a height of 10′ or greater,
resembling cylindrical chimneys.
Mud: A viscous, bubbling grey slurry, streaked red and
pink. Its temperature can vary from a relaxing warmth to
a skin-stripping heat (1d3 damage if touched).
Eruption: Build-up causes the mudpots to unpredictably
erupt. Once per day, there is a 3-in-6 chance of an eruption
close to the PCs: all characters must Save Versus Blast or
be splattered with searing mud (1d4 damage).
Salamanders: Scurrying between the hot mudpots and
the cooler bog are striped salamanders.

The Witch’s Cottage (Hidden)
A cottage fashioned from stone and packed dirt stands
amid a maze of towering mudpots, partially buried in falling mud. The sparkle of light on glass betrays its location.
Entrance: There is a 1-in-6 chance that Old Ned is lounging
half-asleep at the cottage door.
Interior: Crowded with cooking and alchemical equipment. Lit by 2d3 fire beetles (DMB) crawling on the walls. A
cot rests in a corner, beside an offal-strewn dissection table.

Striped Salamanders
Small, dark red amphibians that radiate an intense heat.
Capturing: The salamanders are extremely quick and
nimble; a day spent on attempted captures yields only
1d6. Unless Deidre calls Old Ned off, such efforts arouse
its wrath, and it attacks would-be gatherers soon after
they begin.
Value: Prized as an alchemical ingredient, they are
worth 50gp each to the right buyer.

Old Ned—Giant Salamander
A mutant salamander the size of a small horse. Its scaled
coat is a dull red colour, with black scarring across its
left flank. Shrewd for an animal. Treats Deidre with
affection. When foraging amongst the mudpots, it
views anyone it encounters as prey, but is pacified if
large amounts of food are offered. If followed, Old Ned
eventually returns to the Witch’s Cottage.
Large Monstrosity—Semi-Intelligent—Neutral

Level 6 AC 17 HP 30 Saves D9 R10 H11 B12 S13
Att 2 claws (+5, 1d4) and bite (+5, 1d8) Speed 40
Swim 40 Morale 8 XP 520
Immunities: Unharmed by fire.
Heat aura: 1d8 damage per Round to all within 20′.

Greenhouse: A side chamber topped with a glass roof acts
as a greenhouse for an eclectic mix of plants and fungi. At
any time, 1d4 rations of edible plants and 1d4 rations of
edible fungi (see Foraging, p118) are ripe.
Inhabitants: The hermit witch Deidre Loam, her pet giant
salamander Old Ned, and a colony of semi-domesticated,
foot-long fire beetles living underneath.
Visitors: Vexed and irritated, Deidre demands the party
depart at once, threatening to sic Old Ned on them.
However, successful negotiation reveals that she is willing
to trade for Horridwort (p430) from hex 1002. In return,
she allows the party to gather the valuable striped salamanders, untroubled by Old Ned, for one day.
Treasure: A search of the cottage’s mess reveals 128gp,
34sp, 87cp, a collection of eight silver rings (10gp each), and
three unlabelled bottles: Distillation of Hoarfrost, Philtre of
Delusion, Vaporous Spirits. See Potions, p414.

Deidre Loam—Witch (Eye of Hasturiel)
A grim, lean human woman in her late 50s, with short
grey hair and pinprick eyes. Always wears a smock
splattered with mud, juices, and viscera. Her scent
is dizzying. Deidre spends most of her time engaged
in her sole pursuit: experimenting with alchemical
concoctions and food recipes.
Demeanour (Neutral): Anti-social and put upon.
Prefers simple, transactional relationships.
Speech: Like gravel. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: Rare and interesting ingredients (plants, fungi,
or magical creatures). For interlopers to go away and
stop stealing “her” salamanders.
Possessions: Earrings fashioned from salamander eyes
encased in glass, which make the wearer immune to
heat (per the holy spell Flame Ward).

1103

The Lightless Tower

Sludge-choked pools, sluggish rivulets, and sodden fens with little dry ground. The air feels thick and ailing.
Terrain: Bog (3), Fever Marsh
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Thorny Scrub
The northern stretches of this hex take on an especially
forlorn character. Wiry, black-stemmed bushes covered
in vicious thorns carpet the ground up to knee-height,
making passage laborious and painful.

Brinemere
At the centre of the thorny region lies the salt-sludge of
Brinemere. The surface of the lake is patched with a crust
of pure white salt crystals; its grey waters are lifeless and
offensively salty.

Chantery Isle
A low, flat island of salty mud can be seen in the middle
of Brinemere, formed around a rocky outcropping half a
mile from the southern shore. At the centre of the island,
where the land rises up slightly, a cluster of cypress trees
looms conspicuously. The stand is cloaked with a sinister
gloom and a deathly quiet.

The Lightless Tower
Amid the gloomy copse of cypress trees upon Chantery Isle
stands a windowless, circular tower of polished, jet-black
stone, three storeys tall.
Proof against scrying: The tower and its contents are invisible to all forms of scrying and locating magic.
Entrance: A single portal­—a yawning maw of blackness—
grants access to its insides.
History: The tower upon Chantery Isle was constructed by
the renegade Drune known as the Aubrathon (see p55).

Inside the Tower
Gloom: Both magical and mundane lights dim and falter.
Ground floor: Empty apart from a narrow stairway winding around the wall.
Middle floor: Also empty. The stairway ends at a trapdoor,
barring entry to the upper floor.
Trapdoor: Dark wood, hermetically sealed with red wax
around its sides, and sealed with a Glyph of Locking (by a
Level 12 caster). Magical runes glow faintly on its surface. If
deciphered, they read “Sealed by the Will of the Aubrathon.
Within lies Death.”
Upper floor: Filled with a deadly, blue vapour that falls out
of the trapdoor when opened (Save Versus Doom with a
–2 penalty or die). At the edges of the 10′-round chamber,
gargoyles carved into ancient beams of black-stained wood
peer down. At the centre of the chamber, upon a basalt
plinth, stands the Onyx Mirror.

310

The Onyx Mirror
A dark, scintillating mirror wrought of black onyx. This
is one of the long-lost Mirrors of Embala (see p75).
Powers: One who gazes into the onyx mirror alone at
night sees an idealised vision of themselves, stripped of
all self-criticism or overreaching bravado, at the prime
of their power and beauty. The character’s Charisma
increases by 3 points for the following 24 hours.
Dreams: After using the mirror, a character’s sleep
for 7 nights is wracked with feverish dreams of diving
into the unfathomable darkness of the Groaning Loch,
drowning in the embrace of a great serpent.

Cobton-on-the-Shiver and the Giant Egg 1104
The wide, central region of the Valley of Wise Beasts. Woodland glades dotted with little Cobbin farms.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Valley of Wise Beasts
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with a patrol of 2d6 crookhorns (DMB) from the
garrison at the Baron’s tower (hex 1004). They patrol
down into the Valley from the tower, meting out terrible and anarchic justice. They attempt to arrest outsiders and bring them before the Baron.

The Village of Cobton-on-the-Shiver
Beside a bend in the River Shiver sits a quaint, idyllic-seeming village of painted wooden houses, half human size. The
village is populated by Cobbins (DMB) of many different
species, industriously going about their business and scuttering from house to house.
Larger, stone buildings: Human-sized, can be seen in the
village square.
Crookhorn soldiers: Surly crookhorns swagger around the
village, cackling and bullying the Cobbins.
Full settlement description: See p136.

The Giant Egg
A curious farm is located in a broad glade a mile west
of Cobton. Much of the glade is partitioned into fenced
animal pens, where geese, domesticated quails, and miniature pigs honk and squeal. At one side stands a Cobbinsized cottage with a giant egg perched atop its thatched
roof, propped up with poles.
The egg: 5′ wide, creamy white with speckles of blue. It
first appeared ten years ago, the size of a duck’s egg, and
has grown progressively since. Unbeknown to those who
observe it, the egg is now close to hatching. In 1d6 days, a
giant black cygnet—Chrysaïs—will emerge.

Chrysaïs—Giant Cygnet
A giant black cygnet, 10′ tall, with eyes and wing tips of
bronze. Claims to be a prophet of the Pluritine Church
sent to battle the forces of Chaos in Dolmenwood.
Demeanour (Lawful): Gentle, beatific, otherworldly.
Speech: Melodious, noble. Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: To root out corruption, bring justice to the
downtrodden, and vanquish the forces of Chaos.
Combat stats: Giant hawk (DMB). Will continue to grow,
in time reaching truly gargantuan proportions (Level
24, with 24d8 HP).

Inhabitants: A family of badger Cobbins: Chumbra
Burrowflop, her husband Mollow, and their five cubs. The
Cobbins believe they are blessed by the Nag-Lord and that
a wondrous serpent-unicorn grows inside the egg.
Crookhorn patrols: There is a 3-in-6 chance of 1d6 crookhorns being present, eyeing the giant egg suspiciously.
Baron Fragglehorn (p46) takes great interest in the
egg, presuming it to be either a weapon or treasure of some
kind. They do not tamper with it, for the time being.
Visitors: Are welcomed by the Cobbins, encouraged to
view the marvellous egg, then hurried away before they
are spotted by crookhorns.

Chumbra Burrowflop—Cobbin (Badger)
A youthful female badger with an unusual red stripe
on her nose. Wears a frayed, checked dress with a widebrimmed straw hat and copper hoop earrings.
Demeanour (Lawful): Frolicsome, excitable.
Speech: Shrill growling. Woldish, Gaffe.
Desires: Baron Fragglehorn’s praise for her devoted
raising of the giant egg. Magical means of peering
inside the giant egg.

311

1105

Harrowmoor Keep

Gloomy, rugged woods dotted with jagged fingers of dark granite. A groaning wind blows from the Loch.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6.
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.

The Groaning Loch
Dangerous waters: Fathomless, cold, and unquiet. Unpredictable currents, whirlpools, and the presence of kelpies (DMB) make navigation of the loch’s waters a perilous
undertaking; few boats are ever seen upon it.
Cliffs: The Loch is bounded by forbidding, granite cliffs,
200 yards high.
Bays: In places, the waves of the Loch lap against forlorn
beaches of black shingle.

Harrowmoor Keep
Perched upon the high, granite cliffs that verge the
southern extent of the loch is the hereditary seat of the
Harrowmoor family, who have lordship (under the Duke
of Brackenwold) over this region of Dolmenwood.
The manse: The keep is tall and heavily fortified, with
a steeply-roofed turret at each corner—all inhabited by
cawing flocks of rooks. Its gates face southward, opening
onto the bend where the Harrow Road from Prigwort turns
and becomes Lochsbreth Road. Looking up at the keep
from the waters of the loch below, it appears to be carved
from the same granite as the cliffs, with hardly a join.
Interior: Chilly halls of echoing stone, starkly decorated
with ancient tapestries, ancestral suits of armour, and
ornamental polearms.
Inhabitants: The people of House Harrowmoor, presided
over by Lady Theatrice Harrowmoor (p60), and consisting of her family, guards, servants, and cats.
Visitors: The Harrowmoor family have a reputation as
being distant, unwelcoming, and severe. The Lady may,
however, offer her hospitality to intellectuals, academics,
or those of poetic spirit.
Library: The lower chambers of the keep are dug within the
cliff itself. Among them is an ancient library, where dusty
tomes of philosophy and history rest upon oaken shelves
in dim candlelight. Behind one bookcase, a secret door
leads to a steep stair carved into the granite of the cliffs,
which winds its way downward to the Cove of the Forroth.

The Cove of the Forroth
A desolate, stony cove beside the loch. A steep stair runs
from the cove to a secret door in the cliffs, leading to the
library of Harrowmoor Keep.
Summoning the Forroth: At this site, at midnight on a
moonless night, one who performs beautiful, mournful
songs on the magical flute in the Harrowmoor family’s
possession (see p60) may summon a monstrous entity
known to the Harrowmoor family as the Forroth.

312

The Forroth: A gargantuan, jelly-like monstrosity which
lurks in the abyss of the loch. Its form is a roughly spherical
mass, sprawling with luminescent green tentacles.
Communion: Once summoned, the Forroth enters into a
telepathic communion with all present in the cove, drawing them into a dream of the black, watery chasm in which
it dwells. This fugue lasts until dawn. The after-effects are
1d3 days of exhaustion plus an insight into a puzzle or
problem that plagues one’s mind.
Unearthly advisor: Consultation of the Forroth in times
of trouble is a tradition among the lords and ladies of
House Harrowmoor, though over-frequent contact with
the entity caused several people in the line to succumb to
delusions and waking nightmares.

Prigwort and the Swinney Tower

1106

Gently swaying, golden-leafed beeches sigh contentedly, eye-like whorls peering curiously at travellers.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Nighttime encounters on the
road are 2-in-6 likely to be with the ghost of Dewidort
of Smerne (see hex 0607).
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.

The Town of Prigwort
Nestled in a hilly clearing in the deep woods, the thriving
market town of Prigwort is the largest settlement beneath
the eaves of Dolmenwood.
Brewing: Prigwort is famed for its breweries and distilleries, the town council consisting of the leaders of the seven
noble brewing houses.
Fortification: Spurred by rumour of imminent war with
the crookhorns mustering in the north, a fortified garrison
is currently under construction on the edge of Prigwort.
Full settlement description: See p174.

The Swinney Tower
In the west of this hex, Swinney Road passes beneath a
20′-high wooded bank. Hints of a watchtower overlooking the road can be spied, a little way back in the woods at
the top of the bank. This is a recently renovated defensive
fortification operated by the Order of St Sedge (see Clerical
Orders, p68) against the mustering crookhorn forces.
Approaching the tower: A narrow path hidden in the
bushes slopes up to the tower’s door. The tower is circular, four storeys high, and built of roughly cut stone, now
timeworn and patched with moss. 1d3 soldiers (Level 1
fighters—DMB) atop the battlements aim crossbows down
from at strangers and demand to know their business.
Entrance: A wooden door reinforced with iron bands. Each
band is engraved with the Liturgic script “Thorn, Hammer,
and Grail” (the motto of the Order of St Sedge).
Interior: Cramped chambers stuffed with arms, crates of
supplies, spartan bunks, and idols of St Sedge. Everything is
ordered with military precision, aside from incongruously
jumbled piles of inside-out clothing (the work of the house
bogle—see below). The commander—Hilda Harrowmoor
(p70)—keeps a small chamber on the third floor.

Jilly Jump-at-the-Moon—House Bogle
A stumpy, 1½’ tall fairy with skin like knotted wood,
huge, staring cat’s eyes, and a gurning grin of crooked
teeth. Remains invisible most of the time, but may
manifest to fairy-friends.
Demeanour (Neutral): Shy, but can be tempted out with
food and drink.
Speech: Lethargic mewling and sighing. Basic Woldish,
Sylvan.
Desires: Milk, ale, sweet treats.
Knowledge: Knows of the Earl of Yellow’s patronage
of Prigwort, and may casually mention it as common
knowledge.
Combat stats: Sprite—yellow (DMB), without flight.

Inhabitants: A small troop of 2d4 acolytes (Level 1 clerics—DMB) of the Order of St Sedge and 2d4 soldiers of
House Harrowmoor (Level 1 fighters—DMB), commanded
by Hilda Harrowmoor.
The house bogle: A fairy known as Jilly Jump-at-the-Moon
lodges in the cellars and store rooms of the tower, creeping
out at night to pilfer food, hide cutlery, and turn clothes
inside out. The tower inhabitants native to Dolmenwood
laughingly tolerate the fairy’s antics, while those from
outside the Wood wish to evict the creature.
Visitors: Those in the service of the Church, the noble
houses of Dolmenwood, or the Prigwort Alegard are
welcomed. Others are repelled. Watchful PCs who spend a
night in the tower may observe Jilly up to her tricks.

The Wyrm Cave
Paths crossed by many small rivulets, feeding a network of clear, still pools.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Chasm and Lair
A great tangle of overgrown hazels and holly in the southern reaches of this hex conceals a 60′ deep chasm, long
forgotten.
Cave and stream: The chasm bottom—nearly lightless in
the shade of the brush overhead—narrows to a cave-like
passage at one end, from which a small stream trickles.
Lair of Chasobrithe: The passage descends for nearly half
a mile, then opens onto a cavern, 200 yards across. It is
here that Chasobrithe (yellow bile wyrm—DMB) makes its
lair, slumbering atop a mound of treasure (see The Wyrm’s
Hoard) and the skeletal remains and rusted armaments of
some sixteen knights.
Intruding into the lair: Awakens the wyrm.

The Wyrm’s Hoard
Coins: 198,033cp, 44,290sp, 12,522gp, 1,051pp.
Gems: 7 hematites (10gp each), 5 bloodstones (50gp each),
5 tourmalines (100gp each), 3 blue spinels (500gp each), 4
star sapphires (1,000gp each).
Shield of Sir Windlass: A 5′ tall, oblong Holy Shield (Truthful, p400) of shining steel, emblazoned with the Brackenwold coat of arms and blessed by the hand of St Willofrith.
The wielder may cast the holy spell Light once per day.

Chasobrithe—Yellow Bile Wyrm
A yellow bile wyrm with a second, snake-necked cockerel’s head growing from a scar that nearly encircles
his neck.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Lethargy quickly evaporating
to calculating fury.
Speech: Drawn-out rasping. Woldish, Wyrm, Caprice,
Sylvan, the tongue of serpents.
Desires: To remain undisturbed. To gather information
from intruders, then eat them.
Extra attack: Chasobrithe’s cockerel head makes a bite
attack each Round, inflicting 1d6 damage and petrifying any who fail a Save Versus Hold.
Vulnerability: Sunlight.
History: Chasobrithe has lived in the region of Prigwort
for many years and, in olden times, brought great terror
upon the local folk. For the past two centuries the wyrm
has lain in slumber, believed dead after Sir Windlass the
laughing knight (whose remains lie among the wyrm’s
hoard) almost decapitated him. During his long repose,
the wyrm’s wounds have healed, and the cockerel head
grew from the near-fatal neck wound.

314

Sword of Sir Windlass: A broad-bladed Fairy Longsword
(Mirthful, p412) forged of a golden metal, inlaid with
zigzag patterns in fairy silver.
Ivory casket: Engraved with an angelic choir. Worth 200gp.
Contains a vial of Distillation of Hoarfrost (p414) and a
map—annotated in Liturgic—denoting the location of the
lost relics of St Jorrael (see hex 1705).

Louper’s Luncheon

1108

Gloomy, indigo-shadowed woods teeming with croaking frogs and creeping toads.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Louping Wood
This hex is referred to by villagers in the Woodcutters
Encampment (hex 1109) as the “Louping Wood,” and its
uncanniness is immediately apparent to visitors: every
tree of any significant age has a trunk that has grown with
one complete “loop-the-loop” in it about halfway up its
length.
The lost art of louping: Shaping trees in this fashion—“louping”—was once one of the more exotic furnging practices of the Woodcutters’ Encampment, but the
old-timers who started and maintained trees in this
process have long since passed away. None can say whether
the tradition or the name came to the area first.

The Luncheon Arch
Central to the hex is a clearing with a miniature unsupported arch of well-dressed, ancient stone, large enough for
a crawling human or a stooped woodgrue to pass through.
Keystone inscription: The keystone of the little arch is
heavily obscured by lichens, but cleaning it reveals an
inscription: “To dine overnight, will the daytime delight.”
Food transmutation: If foodstuffs are left under the arch
and remain until dawn, they are replaced by an exquisite
version of the same edibles (worth 3d6gp). Beef dripping
might be replaced with a goulash spiced with cloves and
vinegar, for example, while a plate of near inedible rockcakes might be replaced with a single many-tiered chocolate marvel.
Watching overnight: Observers remaining overnight in
the clearing hear a burbling voice after some time. The
voice, at once bird-like and frog-like, firstly emits munching and chewing sounds, and then briefly complains about
thankless tasks and gluttonous masters before the replacement dish appears.

The Witch’s Cave (Hidden)
The swamp of Hag’s Addle encroaches on the south of this
hex in a region of dark willows and sodden ground. A faint
green glow and a strange, heady aroma emanate from a
narrow cave-mouth amid a pile of great boulders here.
Interior: Three small chambers with squelching, muddy
floors, lit by bobbing, green, candle-like flames. The first
chamber contains boots, cloaks, satchels, and stout walking sticks; the second contains a cauldron bubbling over
embers, bundles of herbs drying, and a wicker cot; in the
third are jars of pickled fish, roots, and marsh-onions.

Bragwen Hoad—Witch (Eye of Hasturiel)
A short, pudgy human woman in her thirties, with
wide, roving eyes, cropped black hair, and flame tattoos
on her face and body. She dresses in frayed, mud-spattered gowns. She reeks of onion.
Demeanour (Neutral): Quarrelsome, dislikes being
disturbed. Amenable if matters arcane are broached.
Speech: Halting, veers between booming and whispering. Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: Magic items of all kinds. The return of her
wand, stolen by the baker in hex 1206.
Reward: Removing a curse. Potions of transformation
(into a specific small animal for 1d6 hours).
Knowledge: The stretch of swamp in which the Hag’s
hut can be found (hex 0908). The powers of the Luncheon Arch.
Possessions: An Arcane Dagger (p412) in the form of
a wicked, 12″ thorn with a leather wrapping.
Inhabitants: The witch Bragwen Hoad lives hermit-like
within, spending much of her time (2-in-6 chance) deep
in babbling psychedelic communion with the Gwyrigon
Hasturiel, and otherwise engaged in brewing potions. 3
manikins (DMB)—formed of broken chairs, varnished and
painted with dainty flowers—guard the witch.

Treasure: Hidden among the pickle jars are 220gp, 190sp,
a silver amulet depicting a howling, banshee-like face
(200gp), and an octahedral glass bottle containing 2 doses
of Prismatic Elixir (p414).

315

1109 Woodcutters’ Encampment and Frog Isle
An awful expanse of black water and twisted copses, wreathed in an endless cloak of rolling mist.
Terrain: Swamp (4), Hag’s Addle
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters in the swamp are
2-in-6 likely to be with Father Horsely (p185) and his
dog Clewyd.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions of
Snogglebeard (p430) and 1d2 portions of Witch’s Oyster
(DPB), in addition to the normal results.

The Woodcutters’ Encampment
Perched beside the Lower Hameth on the edge of Hag’s
Addle, the Woodcutters’ Encampment is a community of
once-hardy woodcrafters now grown indolent on the profits of trade. The Encampment is a major stopping point on
the river trade that connects the High Wold, Castle Brackenwold, and the lands to the south of Dolmenwood.
At night: The pale yellow flame that burns in the tower
of the Church of St Foggarty is visible across the swamp,
guiding lost travellers to safety.
Full settlement description: See p182.

Isle of the Frogs (Hidden)
An islet, 50 yards across, formed of rotting trunks and
decayed fungi, drifts through the mists of this hex. A
haphazard chorus of croaks and grunts announces the
isle’s presence, before it drifts into view.
Approaching: The isle is seemingly held together by the
root systems of the trailing mosses and 5′ high ferns that
smother its sodden surface. A many-hued multitude of
frogs teems around the isle and the surrounding waters.
A raised bulk can be seen shrouded in mist at the isle’s
summit.
Climbing onto the isle: Unless using special tools, techniques, magic, etc., characters must make a Dexterity
Check to scale the isle’s slippery, bobbing sides. Those who
fail get drenched in slimy water and suffer a –1 penalty to
Saving Throws until cleaned off on dry land.

316

At the summit: The shattered remnants of a giant frogheaded statue lie toppled amid the ferns, covered in slime
and bedraggled moss. The statue’s head (5′ high) is intact: a
leering, batrachian visage with empty eye sockets (stones
long ago looted) and a tongue lolling from its gaping
mouth, glistening with black slime. As characters gaze
upon the fallen head, the phrase “the tongue, the tongue”
is briefly audible in the chorus of croaks.
Licking the tongue: The slime is horribly bitter: Save
Versus Doom or vomit immediately. The following day,
a character who licked the tongue is cured of one ailment
(e.g. curse, disease, etc.) and develops slimy skin like that
of an amphibian (painful in dry conditions). Repeated lickings of the tongue have no effect.
Re-locating: As the isle drifts in the swamp, locating it
requires characters to search anew with every visit to the
hex (see Travel, DPB).

Dreg and Myrrsian’s Mill

1110

Little streams meander through idyllic glades of lantern elms, their seeds like lambent paper lanterns.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), High Wold / Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions of
young lantern elm roots, used to brew Ofteritch (DPB),
in addition to the normal results.

Dreg and Shantywood Isle
Sitting at the widest point of the River Hameth is the port
and fishing village of Dreg, a major stopping point on the
river trade that connects the High Wold, Castle Brackenwold, and the lands to the south of Dolmenwood.
Seedy reputation: Dreg has a reputation as a haunt for
thieves, charlatans, and rascals of all stripes. Its many inns
and taverns cater to the bawdy tastes of such folk.
Shantywood Isle: Opposite Dreg, the notorious pleasure
isle of Shantywood sits amid the rushing waters of the
Hameth.
Full settlement description: See p140.

Myrrsian’s Mill
A rustic, two-storey, timber-framed watermill stands on
the banks of the Hameth in the north-east corner of this
hex, its paddles producing a cheery splashing that can be
heard from some way off.
Entrance: A circular wooden door, painted purple, inlaid
with thorn and leaf patterns in brass, with a brass knocker
in the form of a smirking imp. The door is sealed with a
Glyph of Locking (by a Level 6 caster).
Dark glazed windows: The mill has four windows (two on
each level), with panes of dark green glass, virtually opaque
from the outside. All are sealed with a Glyph of Locking (by
a Level 6 caster).
Interior: Cosy gloom. Homely woodwork painted with
floral designs. A jumble of pots, pans, pestles and mortars,
and drying herbs strewn over all surfaces. Crystals hang
from low beams, refracting shafts of forest sunlight.
Inhabitants: The magician Myrrsian the Mutable and
3 sprites (DMB)—a pink sprite named Tollowook, a blue
sprite named Lillyshill, and a red sprite named Brigadoone—who act as servants and guest-wranglers, chittering and giggling in Sylvan.
Grinding sound: A low, grinding sound drones continuously, seemingly from below ground. The mill’s inhabitants (if asked) confirm that the sound emanates from the
grinding mill mechanisms in the cellar, which, they insist,
are “purely decorative.”

Myrrsian the Mutable (Level 6 Magician)
A youthful human magician who switches between
two forms (equal chance of either when encountered):
a dashing young man with profound blue eyes and
impressive red moustaches / a dainty young woman
with fine, silver hair and eyes of chestnut. Both forms
are clad in robes of green velvet embroidered with
golden primroses.
Demeanour (Neutral): Convivial but tricksome—
enjoys leaving the room, changing form, then claiming
to be “Myrrsian’s sibling Vyridan,” upon returning. (The
names are not tied to either form; Myrrsian is simply
whichever is encountered first.)
Speech: Melodious, eloquent. Woldish, Sylvan, a smattering of Mewl.
Desires: Magical crystals of all kinds, to act as fodder for
the mill—willing to pay a handsome price. (Myrrsian
believes that an exact balance of different types will
open the portal.)
Possessions: A twisted brass Ring of Duomorph
(p410). An elf-bone Wand of Fear (6 charges). Scrolls
of Web and Confusion.
Spells: Rank 1 Decipher, Fairy Servant, Ingratiate, Rank
2 Glyph of Locking, Mirror Image, Rank 3 Crystal Vision,
Lightning Bolt.

Secret trapdoor: The trapdoor to the cellar is concealed
beneath a carpet and is sealed with a Glyph of Locking (by
a Level 6 caster).
Cellar: Gears and axles slowly turn glowing pink millstones, wreathed in arcs of pale blue electricity. Sinister
black forms periodically appear in the lightning. Myrrsian’s research focuses on using this device to open a
dimensional portal to a shadowy plane of existence.

Nyfward

Odd spatial distortions. Trees and rocks change size when travellers blink. Already traversed paths repeat.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald/High Wold
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Nyfward
A slender, crooked, windowless tower of stone at the river
bank. It impossibly ascends hundreds of yards into the sky,
and yet is not visible from a distance. A yawning arch at
ground level provides entry.
Ground floor: A marble lion-head fountain burbles. In the
pool at the fountain’s base, reflections of jovial, peering
manticores can be seen.
Ascending: A spiral stair ascends from each floor to the
next. No matter how high PCs ascend, they never reach
the top of the tower.
Upper floors: The size and contents of each floor magically change each time the tower is explored. Roll on the
Encounters and Rooms tables for each floor entered.
Monsters: Roll on the dungeon encounter table (p98),
treating the tower’s floor number as the dungeon level,
with a maximum level of 7. Also make a Reaction Roll (see
Encounters, DPB) and roll on the Monster Activities table.
Special encounters: These rooms contain treasure hidden
among the furnishings: 1d20 × 100gp and a 2-in-6 chance
of a random magic item.
History: The strange tower was built by the legendary
arch-wizard Nyf Nimbly, who is said to reside in a magical
workshop at its (unreachable) summit.

they return, they henceforth find the tower empty.

The Falls of Nyf

1112

Paths crisscross among beds of beautiful ferns. Everything appears to be tended by some deliberate hand.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Falls
The Hameth takes a thunderous drop at the legendary Falls
of Nyf, where surging white waters tumble down a 100′
precipice—a majestic and spectacular sight.

The Wondrous Ship-Conveyor
While the falls are indeed one of the region’s greatest natural wonders, they are also home to one of its greatest magical marvels: the great Ship-Conveyor of Nyf.
A boat approaching from the north: Seems bound for
certain doom as it nears the vertical drop of the falls. Just
as its bow crosses the foaming brink, the boat effortlessly
glides, swan-like, into the air, supported by naught but
magic. It then descends the abyss in a slow, stately fashion,
coming to rest at a safe distance beyond the falls’ base,
halting at a fortified wooden gate that spans the river.
A boat approaching from the south: Takes the opposite
course, leaping skyward after it has cleared the gate, slowly
and smoothly ascending the cliff, and alighting on the
Hameth at a safe spot well upstream from the falls.
Wardens and toll-gate: The gate is controlled by House
Mulbreck (hex 1210) and manned by 12 wardens (Level 1
fighters—DMB). They demand a toll from every boat passing through: 1sp/5sp/1gp (for small/medium/large boats).
The wardens are garrisoned in a stout, two-storey guardhouse alongside the gate.
Operation and history: The marvellous Conveyor operates
automatically. Little is known of its origins, save that it was
created by the powerful sorcerer Nyf Nimbly. Control of
the gate and its lucrative toll revenues are granted by the
duke, with great competition and skulduggery between
the lesser noble houses. House Mulbreck currently holds
the contract, valid for the next seven years.

Caves Behind the Falls
Hidden behind the Falls of Nyf is a cavern: low and broad,
dripping and rancid, its walls spongy with a curious moss.
Human bones clatter across the rocky cave-floor. Several
corpses are impaled on stalagmites, infested with more of
the verdant moss.
Lair of Skulp: This dank place is home to a cunning and
vicious troll (DMB) called Skulp.

Skulp—Troll

Agreement with the wardens: Skulp once terrorised the
region at night, attacking boats, wardens, and travellers.
However, the wardens have now struck a deal with her, and
her attacks have ceased. They provide her with any corpses
they fish from the river, battered and bloated. Skulp takes
these corpses and cultivates a species of delicious moss
in their putrescent flesh, which she devours, leaving the
corpses themselves.

Demeanour (Chaotic): Welcoming, eyes up visitors to
assess their moss-worthiness, flies into a rage at the
drop of a hat. Pushes her face right up close to others.

An ancient, stinking, and especially cantankerous troll
with a gaunt, skull-like face atop a wobbly, corpulent
frame. Dresses in slimy rags and scraps of river weed.

Speech: Snivelling, grumbling. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: Fresh corpses upon which to grow her unspeakable moss. In particular, woodgrue bodies, which Skulp
says add a “special something” to the moss’s taste.

319

1201

Ancient Evil
Relentless moaning wind. The sky seems vast and malevolent.

Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

The Excavation
A recently-trafficked trail branches south from the Downs
Road, leading to a large mound ringed by a series of concentric ridges (the widest 300 yards across). An encampment
of tents and wagons squats amid the ancient earthworks.
Inhabitants: 10 labourers, pack animals, and 3 guards
(Level 1 fighters—DMB), led by the adventuring sage Archibald Helmwhit. The group arrived here three days ago after
a long and treacherous journey from Castle Brackenwold.
Approaching: If PCs are spotted, they are warily hailed and
allowed into the encampment.
The excavation: Pursuing Helmwhit’s obsession with the
ancient civilisations of the Table Downs, the expedition is
digging into the earthworks and has also dispatched teams
to two smaller mounds nearby (hexes 1101 and 1202). So far,
they have unearthed sundry artefacts (pottery fragments,
wood carvings, etc.) and have reached a layer of carved
stone, which they are working to break through.
Troubles: Several of the workers have had nightmares in
which the mound shakes, the sky boils, and a demented,
spiteful shrieking fills the air. Helmwhit remains unperturbed and oblivious.
The day after PCs arrive: The workers penetrate the stone
barrier, unearthing the tomb of a powerful and malevolent priestess—Kul—who was magically bound and buried
here in prehistoric times. Exposure to sun and air causes
her wicker-crowned corpse to disintegrate, and her spirit
erupts from the ground as a terrible swirling vortex of
screams, attacking all present (see Spirit of Kul).
Grave artefacts: Atop the dust of Kul’s corpse lie six heavy
bars of intricately carved, polished petrified wood (1,000gp
each) that held Kul in place. Searching beneath the bars
also reveals a desiccated severed finger; on it is a Ring of
Charming (Humans, p410).

Archibald Helmwhit—Sage
A squat, elderly human man, sporting a neatly trimmed
beard, blue robes, and an embroidered red smoking cap.
Demeanour (Neutral): As forgetful and unwitting as
he is self-assured and condescending.
Speech: Precise but repetitive. Woldish, Old Woldish,
Liturgic.
Desires: To unearth the “great treasures” he believes
to be buried here. He welcomes assistance with the
excavation, offering 5gp per PC to assist in the digging,
and 15gp to check on the teams sent to hex 1101 or 1202.
Possessions: 400gp in purse.
Knowledge: Specialises in the history and ancient
civilisation of the Table Downs and Northern Scratch.
Apply the standard rules for hiring a sage (DPB).

320

The Glammering Gate (Hidden)
On the side of a low mound in the south-east of the hex, a
pale mist roils within a stone-lintelled portal.
Touching the mist: Mortals must Save Versus Spell or be
overcome with light-hearted gaiety lasting 1d6 days.
Stepping through the portal: One is whisked away to the
fairy road the White Way (see Fairy Roads, p26).

Spirit of Kul
A seething, 25′ tall, turquoise gyre of spectral energy,
emitting mindless howls of malice from a multitude of
gaping mouths. Deeper wards prevent the spirit from
leaving the ancient earthworks, and it does not pursue
targets past that boundary.
Large Undead—Mindless—Chaotic

Level 12 AC 19 HP 50 Saves D5 R6 H7 B8 S9
Att Whirlwind (+9, 2d8) Fly 120 Morale 10 XP 3,800
Undead: Immune to biological effects (e.g. disease,
poison) and mind-affecting spells (e.g. Vapours of
Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).
Whirlwind: The spirit makes a single Attack Roll
against all creatures in a 10′ radius area. Creatures of
Level 2 or lower in the area must also Save Versus Hold
or be swept up in the vortex and killed.
Immunities: Only harmed by magic or magic weapons.
Howling: Any within 60′ hearing the spirit’s howls
must Save Versus Hold or be paralysed with terror
for 1d4 Rounds (aware but unable to move or act). Each
character must save once per encounter with the spirit.

Mound of the Willing Sacrifice

1202

A bewildering expanse of thorn trees, chest-high reeds, and stinking pools. Sound here is painfully amplified.
Terrain: Swamp (4), Fever Marsh
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 1-in-6 likely to
be with the Willing Sacrifice.

The Mound
A burial mound sits in the centre of a drier patch of the
otherwise waterlogged swamp. The reeds of the patch are
plastered flat, pointing away from the mound.
Appearance: The mound is 60′ in diameter and composed
of dirt and stone. Hanging moss dapples its surface in
drooping, forlorn patches. It has a single stone entrance,
above which is carved the snarling visage of a bear—PCs
versed in Wood God lore recognise it as that of Orsath
(p39), the ancient guardian of the dead. The entrance is
extremely narrow and requires characters to turn side-on
to enter the Reception Chamber.
History: The mound is one of several created by prehistoric inhabitants of the Table Downs (see also hexes
1101 and 1201). This one was the resting place of a tribe
member buried alive as a willing sacrifice in the ritual that
entombed Kul, a wicked and dangerous priestess, in the
mound in hex 1201. Over the millennia, Kul’s evil infected
the sacrifice, whose reanimated corpse now roams the hex
in search of mortal victims.

Reception Chamber
The mound entrance leads to a reception chamber with
walls of stone. The chamber takes up one half of the mound.
Fresh corpses: Sprawled about the chamber are six human
bodies, only a few days dead. Their faces are rictus masks of
agony, and their hands are clutched to their ears, in which
dried blood is pooled. Lying among the corpses are shovels,
picks, and provisioned backpacks. (This is the group sent
by the expedition in hex 1201.)
Wall carvings: The stone walls are carved with a sequence
of images. The first depicts a priestess, bedecked in a robe
and wicker crown, reaching up to the sky, surrounded by
blood-red whirlwinds. The second shows figures clad in
loincloths burying her beneath a mound amid a series
of concentric ridges (hex 1201). The third shows a bearmasked woman sacrificed, her blood dripping down to seal
the priestess beneath the mound.

The Willing Sacrifice
A grave-blackened corpse clad in filthy ornamental
robes, striding with swift preternatural grace, reeking of befouled earth. While her limbs are sinuous and
lithe, her stomach is a distended bulge, and a sickly
turquoise glow emanates from within it. Strapped onto
her face is a cracked, wooden bear-face mask.
Medium Undead—Semi-Intelligent—Chaotic

Level 7 AC 16 HP 37 Saves D8 R9 H10 B11 S12
Att Claw (+6, 1d8) or shriek (2d6) Speed 40 Morale 10
XP 1,080
Undead: Silent before attacking. Immune to biological
effects (e.g. disease, poison) and mind-affecting spells
(e.g. Vapours of Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).
Immunities: Only harmed by magic, silver weapons,
or magic weapons.
Shriek (thrice a day): A horrendously piercing shriek
over a 30′ long cone, toppling unsecured objects and
inflicting 2d6 damage on living creatures (Save Versus
Hold for half damage; those with ear protection or deafness automatically succeed).

Burial chamber door: The entrance to the burial chamber
is open, a tall and heavy stone lying on the ground beside it.

Burial Chamber
The burial chamber takes up the other half of the mound.
Scratched walls: The chamber walls appear to have been
scratched deeply and repeatedly, over a very long time.
Pit: At the far end of the chamber is a pit, 8′ in diameter and
40′ deep, surrounded by piles of loose dirt. At the bottom
are four sealed earthen jars, each containing a different
carved amber totem (1,000gp each).
Entering the pit: Once a PC reaches the pit bottom, the
Willing Sacrifice returns to the mound and attacks.

Tangled willow woods, thick with vines and ditches filled with mounds of decaying leaves.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Valley of Wise Beasts
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Longshanks Falls
The River Shiver plunges down into the Valley of Wise
Beasts, over a set of sheer-walled, 100′ sandstone cliffs.
Caves: Small caves pockmark the sides of the cliffs. In
one of them, two fugitives from the rule of the Nag-Lord
(p45) have made their home (see Scruff and Stripe).

Bottom of the Valley
Following the south-westerly course of the River Shiver,
the Valley of Wise Beasts widens from 100 yards across
at the base of Longshanks Falls to half a mile across. The
eastern end of the Valley, in this hex, is composed of wild
forest and is scantly inhabited.

The Elder Willows
A cluster of seven gargantuan (350′ tall), ancient willow
trees looms above the top of Longshanks Falls. The local
Cobbins call them the Elder Willows.
Roots: Several clusters of roots descend from the willows
alongside the falls to the base of the Valley below. These can
be used as a kind of ladder to ascend or descend the cliffs,
and to reach some of the caves.
In the boughs: The high branches of the trees are home to
colonies of gelatinous apes (Animals, DMB) and sprites
(DMB) of all kinds.
Lilac moss: Just visible from ground level, the upper
boughs are crusted with patches of fuzzy, lilac moss known
as Sclubber’s Twist (p430). Parties of sprites lounge upon
the moss and chew clumps of it. The gelatinous apes avoid
the stuff. Characters who make the 300′ climb may harvest
1d6 portions of the moss per hour.

Scruff Gobshyte—Crookhorn
This low-ranking crookhorn woman’s crime was being
unable to correctly state whether her master, Baron
Fragglehorn (p46), was “wickedly handsome” or
“handsomely wicked.”
Demeanour (Chaotic): Stubborn, irritable, foolishly
brave. Secretly protective towards Stripe, whom she
believes to be physically weaker.
Speech: Growling and impatient. Gaffe, halting Woldish.
Desires: Wavers between wanting to overthrow Fragglehorn and wanting to leave the Valley.
Knowledge: The location of the shrine beneath Baron
Fragglehorn’s tower (1004).

Scruff and Stripe
PCs climbing near one of the larger caves may overhear
a heated exchange. Inside the cave is a makeshift camp:
bedrolls and some crude cooking implements. A crookhorn (DMB) called Scruff and a polecat Cobbin (DMB) called
Stripe are loudly arguing over differences in hygienic
standards.
Intruders: If they notice intruders into their cave, the pair
cease their bickering and confront the party. The crookhorn demands the PCs prove they are not agents of Baron
Fragglehorn (p46) if they wish to live, as the polecat
postures menacingly beside him.
History: Originally strangers, they were imprisoned
several months prior in a stockade in Cobton-on-theShiver (p136), where they were slated to be executed.
They escaped together (each claiming sole credit for this
accomplishment) and found their way to the cave. Having
arrived at a sort of grudging accommodation, they now
cooperate as unlikely (and highly quarrelsome) roommates.

322

Barney “Stripe” McGrew—Cobbin (Polecat)
Arrested after bragging (falsely) of his membership in
the Grey League (p136), Stripe is really just a failed
con artist and ne’er-do-well.
Demeanour (Neutral): Fast-talking, with a veneer of
confidence masking deep fearfulness. Secretly protective towards Scruff, whom he believes to be not too
bright.
Speech: Riddled with flowery malapropisms. Woldish,
Gaffe.
Desires: Unsure of his next move, but cannot imagine
life outside the Valley.
Knowledge: The existence of the Grey League, and their
meeting location (p136).

The Breath of the Kelpie

1204

Quiet, sighing woods, punctuated with crags and cliffs of granite.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6

The Groaning Loch
Dangerous waters: Fathomless, cold, and unquiet. Unpredictable currents, whirlpools, and the presence of kelpies
(DMB) make navigating the loch’s waters a perilous undertaking; few boats are ever seen upon it.
Cliffs: The Loch is bounded by forbidding, granite cliffs,
200 yards high.
Bays: In places, the waves of the Loch lap against forlorn
beaches of black shingle.
Embala’s repose: The lost Wood God Embala slumbers
feverishly in a crevice in the unfathomable deeps of the
Loch. The only means of awakening and contacting Embala
is with the three Mirrors of Embala (p75).

The Kelpie Forest
In the deeps of the Loch here grows a vast tangle of waterweed, 250 yards down.
Lights: The weed-forest is dotted with distant, twinkling
lights, as if of villages and castles submerged in the deeps.

Hallyd Ongledrome—Breath of the Kelpie
Proprietor

Gazing at the forest: Elicits the odd sensation of looking
down upon Dolmenwood from on high: the weed-forest
has the same basic shape as the Wood, with the twinkling
lights located roughly in the same positions as the towns
and villages of mortal folk.

A human man in his late 50s, with straggly, white hair
and a silver-rimmed monocle. Dresses in dapper waistcoats and silk pantaloons, with a walking cane.

Descending to the forest: The twinkling lights are, in fact,
colonies of an aquatic form of marsh lantern (DMB), luring
fish to their doom. The forest is also a favoured dreaming
place of kelpies (DMB), who are none too pleased to be
disturbed by land-dwellers.

The Breath of the Kelpie (Inn)
Clinging perilously upon the summit of the cliffs beside
Lochsbreth Road is a curious inn: The Breath of the Kelpie.

Demeanour (Neutral): Cultivates a refined and erudite
air. Shrewd businessman. Treacherous.
Speech: Ingratiating, rambling. Woldish.
Desires: People’s secrets, which he is happy to sell to
others. Discreet liaisons with beautiful young things
(gender immaterial).
Knowledge: Ongledrome is privy to the plight of Lady
Harrowmoor (p60), whose daughter Violet is missing. He is willing to divulge this information—and the
fact that she would reward the girl’s rescuer—for 25gp.

Appearance: A teetering construction—taller than it is
wide—of jumbled gables and stacked turrets, all of dark,
lacquered wood.

Services at the Breath of the Kelpie

Sign: A green horse with a fish’s tail, pink blossom streaming from its mouth.

Turret rooms: Private rooms overlooking the Loch,
1gp per night.

Entrance: A circular door, painted pink, with a hand-worn
brass knob in the centre.

Lakeside veranda: Paying guests at the inn may step
out onto the veranda at its rear—a lantern-bedecked
platform hanging over the edge of the cliff. It offers
spectacular and dizzying views of the Loch.

Common room: Cramped; packed with narrow benches
and too-small tables. The bar is on a mezzanine above. The
landlord, Hallyd Ongledrome, presides watchfully.
Guests: Primarily travellers along the Lochsbreth Road:
merchants, pedlars, friars, bards, and mercenaries.

The Shrine to St Horace (Hidden)
An ornate, marble shrine leans askew against a black boulder in a muddy bay on the northern shore of the Loch, as if
washed up from the deeps.

Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB).

Statue of St Horace: Red marble, 2′ tall. Depicts the saint
as a friar, with an adder around his neck and a mushroom
upon his head.
Prayer: If the shrine is righted, characters praying may
receive the blessing of St Horace: the ability to cast Serpent
Transformation. See Shrines, p22.

323

1205

Gorthstone
Elegant, golden-leafed beeches seem to caringly shield travellers from the elements.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with 1d4 elf knights (DMB) in the service of the Earl
of Yellow (p32), clad entirely in yellow and mounted
on great golden wolves (as dire wolves, DMB).
Ley line crossing Hoad/Ywyr: Arcane spell-casters
perceive the wailing cries of infants slowly fading into
the moans of the dead, repeating in an endless cycle.

Haunted Pool
At the very centre of the hex lies a large glade, about 500′
wide, surrounding a 300′ diameter pool of clear, placid
water punctuated with clusters of pale green water lilies.
At the very centre of the pool is a tall, black obelisk—the
Gorthstone.
Weather reversal: An odd magic wraps the glade, whereby
the day’s prevailing weather conditions are reversed. On
sunny days, the pool is veiled with fog and storms; in the
deep cold of winter, a clement warmth surrounds the
stone; and so forth.
Gazing into the waters: Reveals the pale, shrouded form of
a young woman, drifting among the lily stems: the Phantom of the Pool.
Touching the waters: Awakens the Phantom of the Pool,
who rises from the water. The person disturbing the pool
must also Save Versus Spell or fall instantly into a deep
slumber for 1d3 hours.
Drinking the waters: Causes a person to instantly fall into
a deep slumber for 1d3 hours, with no save.

Gorthstone
Those who successfully cross the pool arrive at a 20′ wide
dais of crumbling, weed-clad sandstone. Atop it stands a 15′
high obelisk of hard, black rock, veined with silver.
Guardian: The Audrune Haygral. Stepping on the dais
alerts him of intruders, causing him to summon 2 Drune
cottagers (DMB) and 1d4 bramblings (DMB) that arrive in
1d6 Turns.
Examining the stone: Reveals tight bands of ancient Old
Drunic script close to the base of the stone and more recent
Drunic runes around the middle.
Inscribed spell: The Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Trap the Soul (p457). See Ley Lines and Standing Stones,
p18 for details on learning this spell.
Old Drunic script: The ancient script provides instructions
for a ritual that may be performed at this site to dispel
even the deepest enchantments. The ritual requires the
participation of three arcane spell-casters of at least Level
5 and must be performed upon the night of a solstice. At
the culmination of the ritual, the magical components of
the enchantment are unwoven and released as free-willed
demi-plasms—entities of pure magical energy. The Drune
know further magical techniques to bind and command
these entities.

324

The Audrune Haygral
Incorporeal: Haygral has abandoned his physical form
and now exists solely within the flow of the ley energies
around Gorthstone. His body lies in temporal stasis,
ritually interred in the crypts of the Drune Lodge (hex
0507).
Powers: Haygral cannot interact with the physical
world directly, but can send word of intruders to the
Drune Aegis.

The Phantom of the Pool
A pale, spectral human woman dressed in the sodden
white vestments of some long-forgotten sect. In her
eyes burns an eerie blue light. Upon being awakened
from the pool, she drifts towards the nearest living
creature, beseeching that “the Staff of the Apostle must
be restored.” If the listener does not understand her
pleas (or ignores or mocks her), she attacks.
Demeanour (Neutral): Despondent, hateful of the
living who do not understand her plight.
Speech: Otherworldly wailing. Woldish.
Desires: To be laid to rest by the reconstitution of a staff,
belonging to the Church, that once imprisoned her.
Combat stats: Spectre (DMB). If slain, returns 7 days later.
History: Originally a high priestess of a Gwyrae sect,
the Church trapped her spirit within the Staff of the
Apostle, a powerful relic. When the Drune destroyed the
staff here through the disenchantment ritual engraved
on Gorthstone, she was released as a demi-plasm. The
Drune then bound her to the pool to act as a guardian
for the stone. She believes she can be freed by recreating
the staff—practically, an impossibility. However, she
can in fact be freed by performing the disenchantment
ritual on the pool itself.

The Baker’s Dozen

1206

Dense, forbidding woods of twisted elm and hawthorn. Many paths lead to gloomy dead-ends.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Nighttime encounters on the
road are 2-in-6 likely to be with the ghost of Dewidort
of Smerne (see hex 0607).

The Bakery
A charming, thatched cottage lies nestled in a glade half
a mile south of Horse-Eye Road. Mouthwatering scents of
cinnamon and gingerbread waft from the dwelling.
Inhabitants: A baker (and, secretly, magician) known only
as Mother and her 12 daughters spend their days baking
all manner of tantalising pastries and tarts. The daughters vary greatly in appearance, and range from ages 7 to
21. The older daughters operate a popular market stall in
Prigwort (p176), and the family also produces commissioned specialties for local nobles and gentry (magically
enhanced, for the most exclusive clients).
Main room: Spacious, dominated by a massive oaken
table. Cats leap and play in the rafters above. Shelves are
laden with homely crockery and chinaware.
Kitchen: The heat and bulk of an enormous brick oven
dominate the kitchen. Higgledy-piggledy shelves line the
walls, brimming with jars of biscuits, flour, herbs, and
spices. One jar contains 12 Chocolate Chip Healing Cookies (eating one heals 1d6 HP, worth 800gp each). Another,
hidden at the back of a shelf, contains 17pp, 214gp, 112sp.
Back door: Opening from the kitchen to a small herb
garden and a path leading to the Dough Pool.
Mother’s bedroom: Dark and cosy. Lined with shelves
crammed with cookbooks, with several treatises on sorcery
and enchantment in more hidden corners. Beneath a floorboard are Mother’s spell books (see combat stats for spell
list). Beneath the bed's mattress is a jewellery box with 16
ametrines (100gp each) and a diamond hat-pin (600gp).
Daughters’ bedrooms: Each has her own bedroom on
either the ground floor or the upper floor. In several hang
needlepoint samplers featuring Sylvan names and phrases.
Visitors: Are greeted cordially, though gently but firmly
prevented from exploring inside the house. Delicious,
freshly-baked pastries are available for 2sp each.

The Dough Pool
A 60′ wide pool of yeasty, frothing dough belches and
bubbles at the rear of the bakery.
Wardens: 6 gingerbread servitors (6′ tall, treat as manikins—DMB) mindlessly stir the pool, their sugar icing
faces grinning vacantly at onlookers. They periodically
spoon finished dough into wheelbarrows for delivery to
the kitchen. Each servitor contains the charred skeleton of
a rogue who crossed Mother or her daughters, captured by
the family and baked alive in gingerbread dough.

Mother (Level 5 Magician)
A plump, middle-aged human woman, with unruly
curls, a rolling pin in hand, a floured apron, and a
twinkle in her eye. She is always referred to simply as
“Mother” and will not reveal any other name.
Demeanour (Neutral): Jolly, secretive, fanatically
protective of her daughters. Habitually rubs her hands
together, brushing off clouds of flour.
Speech: Charmingly rustic. Addresses strangers as
“deary.” Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: To support her family and protect the secrets
of her enterprise. Lover’s Gasp mushrooms (p428),
required for an extravagant, enchanted wedding
gateau commissioned by the Earl of Yellow (p32).
She knows only that the mushrooms can be found “in
the vicinity of cliffs in the High Wold” (in fact, hex 0811).
Rewards: 200gp for 12 portions of Lover’s Gasp.
Possessions: Wields a rolling pin (1d4 damage). A
plain silver Ring of Vanishing (p410, command word
“MIGRAMANALANAX”). A Wand of Polymorph (12
charges), which her daughters stole from the witch
Bragwen Hoad in hex 1108, required for the enchanted
gateau she is preparing to bake for the Earl of Yellow.
Servants: Mother commands the gingerbread servitors
that work the Dough Pool and can summon them to aid
in 1d4 Rounds.
Spells: Rank 1 Gingerbread Charm, Yeast Growth, Rank 2
En Croute, Mirror Image, Rank 3 Ginger Snap. See Uncommon Spells, p454.

Tool shed: Contains wheelbarrows and a variety of tools
for working the dough pool (long ladles, shovels, spoons).
Tumbledown cottage: The gingerbread servitors sleep
here at night in cosy beds.

1207

Crystal Caves Around Fog Lake
The booming croaks of bog-owls echo from the surrounding vegetation.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Fog Lake
Fog Lake is an obvious and apt name for this basin-shaped
location, as it is usually blanketed in obscurity with thick
bluish-white vapour.
Fog-clearing winds: Occasionally a stray gust of wind
blows through from the surrounding woodlands,
completely sweeping away the fog. It generally returns
within half an hour.
Crystal brewer: The chief manservant of Jollie Oistace
Pollard (hex 1209), Duncan Mudmurloe, can often be
found on the banks of the lake, sitting cross-legged and
gazing mournfully at the lake while cooking down pans
of noxious crystal-sludge obtained from nearby caves
(see Crystal Caves). He is manufacturing the drug Azoth
(p426), which can only be made within earshot of the
lake’s lapping waters. This dangerous and dull job is made
worse by Fog Lake being prone to flooding.

Crystal Caves
The most notable feature of the site is the so-called Crystal
Caves, a series of holes in the steep gravelly declivities that
lead down to the lakeshore.
Russet crystals: At the backs of the caves can sometimes
be seen deep russet crystals in chaotic formations. They
are actually fairly unremarkable—not shiny or numerous,
and at their largest about shin-high. The rock in these caves
is very soft and crumbly, and these fast growing crystals
rapidly decay into slushy, gravelly mud shortly after reaching full size.
Pilgrims and visitors: As soft and unimpressive as the
crystals may be, the appellation of “Crystal Caves” remains,
and draws tourists. There is a 2-in-6 chance that 1d6 naïve
urban pilgrims (everyday mortals—DMB) are in the
area, seeking to touch the crystals as part of a bogus healing ritual—this despite the dangers of the surrounding
Dolmenwood.
Azoth ingredient: The crystals are the main component
of the drug Azoth (p426), though this is unknown to the
average pilgrim.

The Mizzle Door (Hidden)
In a dell upon the wooded slopes to the north of Fog Lake,
the persistent mist swirls and coalesces into the form of a
gigantic doorway flanked by two fearsome, sword-wielding
guardians.
Approaching the door: The misty guardians turn their
heads to observe those who approach, but otherwise
remain immobile.
Stepping through the door: One is whisked away to the
fairy road the White Way (see Fairy Roads, p26).

326

Duncan Mudmurloe
A stiff, lanky human man in his mid-thirties, with
dry, pallid skin and an anaemic moustache. Dresses in
courtly breeches, jacket, and absurdly high, powdered
wig, even when toiling beside Fog Lake. Mudmurloe is
the “gentleman’s gentleman” of Jollie Oistace Pollard
(p328), and hails from High-Hankle. His duties have,
of late, tended more and more to the manufacture of
Azoth at Fog Lake, which his master has been consuming and demanding in ever-increasing quantities.
Demeanour (Neutral): Haughty, beleaguered,
depressed. Habitually sniffs, due to unintentional
inhaling of crystal-sludge vapours.
Speech: Prissy and precise. Woldish, Old Woldish, Liturgic, Caprice.
Desires: To faithfully carry out his duties to this master,
but to somehow find a way of no longer carrying them
out in this perilous and forsaken place.
Possessions: Carries a crossbow and an oversized
spoon for rock-scooping that also serves as a weapon
(1d4 damage).

The Ballow-Clefts

1208

Boggy patches of deciduous growth punctuated by sharp black boulders.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Daytime encounters are
2-in-6 likely to be with 2d6 clueless urban pilgrims
(everyday mortals—DMB) on their way to the crystal
caves at Fog Lake (hex 1207).

Cave Path
The path from the south-east leading to Fog Lake (hex
1207) is called the “Cave Path” by local Woodcutter folk. It
plunges into an incredibly deep rock trough, so high that
the sun only touches the bottom for a few minutes at noon
each day, if at all. It continues in this way for several miles.
Ravine walls: The chilly faces of the trough are streaming
with rivulets of moisture, and are whorled and folded like
the finger-marks of a titan.
Carpet of flowers: Despite the dimness, a carpet of anklehigh plants not dissimilar to a species of pale celandine is
present throughout.
Gloomy clefts: At various heights from the ground, both
sides of the trough feature many clefts deep and wide
enough for Small characters to fit inside, though most
terminate a short distance into the rock.
Befuddling echoes: A traveller taken by a whim to bellow
into a cleft is often surprised to hear their voice echoing
back at them from some point ahead or behind of them on
the path, often rendered comical or sinister by distortions.
Broken musical instruments: The remains of a broken or
neglected musical instrument of low make are sometimes
found in the low vegetation.

The Rock Bridge
Half way along Cave Path, a bridge of black rock arches
above the road. During the day, a grimalkin bard by the
name of Dandy Prisslewhiff sits atop the bridge, idly
strumming her lute.
Passersby: The musical fairy greets passersby with a tip of
the hat. If addressed, she may offer to aid travellers with
her knowledge of the local region if they can answer her
riddle or best her in a musical duel.
Riddle: “Oistace-kyne, tree-herd kin / Fulsome beard upon
your chin / Axe, and saw, and coppice post / What is it that
you fear the most?” Answer: the Drune. (The riddle refers
to the secret fear of the folk of the Woodcutters’ Encampment, see p182.)
Musical duels: Consist of three rounds: a sentimental song
(Charisma Check), a virtuoso song (Dexterity Check),
and an improvisation (Wisdom Check). Prisslewhiff has
Charisma 16 (+2), Dexterity 15 (+1), and Wisdom 12 (+0).
Whoever succeeds their checks for the most rounds is the
victor. Musical duels are conducted primarily for honour,
but the loser is expected to smash their instrument upon
the ravine walls.

Dandy Prisslewhiff (Level 2 Bard)
A silver-furred, amber-eyed grimalkin woman in
extravagant bard’s garb, complete with billowing shirt
sleeves and feather-topped hat.
Demeanour (Lawful): Strident, eminently honourable.
Preens her ears habitually.
Speech: Eloquent drawl. Woldish, Mewl.
Desires: Musical conquests. Learning new songs. Fine
wines and meads.
Knowledge: Secrets of this and surrounding hexes.
Possessions: A silver-stringed lute, 12 portions of
Kitty-Nibbles (p426) in a knapsack, 32gp, a vial of Philtre
of the Winds (p414).

The Shrine to St Wort (Hidden)
In the boggy western reaches of this hex, close to Ransom
Creek, the remnants of a wayside shrine lie toppled in a
ditch.
Tumbled stones: The shrine was a simple dry stone
construction. The stones are now disarrayed and coated
in noisome purple algae.
Statue of St Wort: Amid the tumbled stones, the 2′-high
yew-wood statue of St Wort (depicted naked and bound to
a yew tree) is intact, if somewhat soiled.
Prayer: If the shrine is rebuilt, characters praying may
receive the blessing of St Wort: the ability to cast Speak
With Plants. See Shrines, p22.

327

1209

Ferneddbole House

The whinnying of ponies, the clapping of loose shutters, and occasional disembodied giggling.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters at night are 1-in-6
likely to be with the Moonlit Maw (hex 1311).

Moss-Coated Manse
At the end of a short path from the main road sits a
rambling pile of a three storey, timbered mansion, indistinct in outline due to the sheer volume of mosses it sports.
This is the home of Jollie Oistace Pollard, the hereditary
chieftain of the Woodcutters’ Encampment (hex 1109).
Manor grounds: The grounds echo with the whinnying of
just under a score of pure-bred dwarf ponies—an affected
hobby of Pollard’s, who calls them his “Lovely Oafs.”

Inside the Manor
The interior of the mansion is cramped and illogical in
layout, with great halls sitting side-by-side with cramped
single-file wood panelled passages. Neglect is rife, with
some rooms actually having the limbs of trees or vegetation growing through broken window-panes or loose
stones.
Inhabitants: Jollie Oistace Pollard and his servants,
including hapless head manservant Mudmurloe, who is
usually engaged in perilous tasks at Fog Lake (hex 1207).
The Mornblade: An ancient blue-green sword hangs above
the doorway to the feasting hall. Unbeknown to Pollard, it
is a Fairy Longsword (Slumbering, p412). Its slumbering
effect is only active during the autumn and winter.
Hall of hand sculptures: A very long corridor is lined with
glass cases that feature wooden sculptures of the right
hands of Woodcutters of lore, memorialising the calluses
and scars of their craft.

Jollie Oistace Landriman Pollard
A middle-aged human man, clad in the trappings of his
office—tight breeches with lace tracery in forest shades,
and fine shirt bedecked with buckles. His face has a fine
bone structure buried by the fat of a sedentary life.
He is a near-continuous inhaler of the smoke of Azoth
(p426); his mental extra-planar excursions induced
by the drug have loosened his grip on this plane. In
this and in his disdain for heritage, Pollard is the very
epitome of the softening of the Woodcutter lifestyle.
Title: “Jollie Oistace” (never just “Oistace” or “Jollie”)
is a hereditary title among the Woodcutters, akin to a
minor lord (though Pollard serves House Mulbreck).
Demeanour (Neutral): Distracted, impatient, melancholy, superficial.
Speech: Courtly, with unintentional rustic idioms.
Woldish, Old Woldish, Liturgic, Caprice.
Desires: Azoth. Discussion of extra-planar realms. To
avoid discussing Woodcutter matters.
Combat stats: Everyday mortal (DMB).

328

Portrait gallery: Another gallery features oil portraits of
past members of the Pollard line, depicted in settings of
wild woodsiness. Drunic symbolism can be spotted in the
oldest paintings by those familiar with such lore.
Visitors: Pollard welcomes guests, reluctantly putting
aside a lit pipe of the drug Azoth (p426) from which he
regularly partakes, and offering extremely strong sherry to
break the ice. Despite his apparent sociability, his enquiries about the stories of visitors are feigned politeness. As
evening draws on, his mood often drifts from expansive
to rather spiteful. Discussion of the Woodcutters’ craft
immediately sends him into a sulk.
After dinner: As the PCs prepare to retire, the air shimmers
and a snickering cluster of 1d6+4 astral leapers appear.
Pollard looks on in an indifferent trance as the leapers
throw dinner scraps and cutlery at the party.

Astral Leapers
Transparent, yellow gremlins with spherical bodies,
insect legs, brushes for fingertips, and heads for feet.
These extra-planar creatures are drawn to Ferneddbole
House by Pollard’s frequent out-of-body Azoth trips.
Pollard and his servants deny their existence, but have
all witnessed them wreaking havoc. Leapers fight only
if threatened or hindered in their mischief-making.
Small Monstrosity—Semi-Intelligent—Chaotic

Level 2 AC 15 HP 2d8 (9) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16
Att 2 claws (+1, 1d6) or psychic head-butt (teleportation) Speed 50 Morale 9 XP 35
Psychic head-butt: The leaper violently nuzzles the
target, who must Save Versus Spell. After three failed
saves, the target is transported 1d2 hexes away.
Possessions: Leapers covet gems, and each carries 1d2
gems worth 10 gp each (see p394).

Bogwitt Manor

1210

Sodden, mossy ground, riddled with tickly centipedes.
Terrain: Open forest (2), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters at night are 1-in-6
likely to be with the Moonlit Maw (hex 1311).

Bogwitt Manor
A little-used path leads from the Woodcutters’ Encampment (hex 1109) to Bogwitt Manor, ancestral seat of House
Mulbreck.
Mansion of mould: The ornate resplendence of the manor
is now obscured by slow decay. Its elaborate cupolas,
turrets, and domes are increasingly covered by a vivid
fungal infestation: a burgeoning profusion of colourful
mycelia devouring wood and cracking stone.
Wall and guards: The manor is protected by a low wall
with four guard towers, manned by 14 house guards (Level
1 fighters—DMB).
Interior: Musty chambers crammed with eclectic, sumptuous furnishings, mostly ruined by the mildew and mushrooms blooming riotously throughout. Prominent in the
rot are Mottlecap, Devil’s Grease, and Witch’s Purple (see
Rare Fungi, p428). The humid, stifling air is suffused with
spores, inducing bouts of coughing and sneezing.
Inhabitants: Lady Pulsephine Mulbreck (p61) and her
guards, servants, and 8 sons (see The Mycological Family).
Visitors: The manor is generally not amenable to visitors
without invitations.
Kitchen door to tunnels: Behind a locked door in the
manse’s dim, shabby kitchen lies a staircase, slick with
black lichen, leading into the manor’s cellar and depths
beyond (see The Tunnels). Lady Mulbreck and Mrs. Baine,
the housekeeper, possess the door’s only keys.

The Mycological Family
Lady Mulbreck has eight sons—Lionel, Arthur, Treeve,
Jowan, Wymond, Daubeney, Edwin, and Francois—who
range in age from 22 to 12 and, improbably, were born in
four sets of identical twins.
Shut-ins and recluses: While Lionel & Arthur and Treeve &
Jowan occasionally leave the manor to hunt in the grounds
or visit Chateau Shantywood (hex 1110), the rest of the
Mulbrecks almost never step outside.
Bodily infestations and alterations: Lady Mulbreck
and her four eldest sons have become infested with the
spores of the manor’s all-pervasive fungi. Mycelial filaments spread slowly throughout their bodies, gradually
degrading their physiques, accentuating the already latent
malevolence of their minds, and instilling a compulsion
to consume the fruits of their rot. The infected family
members drift from mouldy room to mouldy room,
nibbling on the decadent delicacies which grow from the
walls and from one another’s bodies.
Family servants: Appear inured to this grotesque state of
affairs. Most are secretly terrified, particularly as several
of their number have mysteriously vanished over the past
few years (see The Tunnels).

The Tunnels
The saprophytic putrescence overtaking the manor flows
from deep within the tunnels and cellars that lie beneath.
Lost servants: In the teeming, fruiting dark, long-lost servants moan, slowly digested by the creeping infestation.
Lord Mulbreck: Imprisoned in the lowest depths is the
addled Lord Mulbreck, his body so wholly consumed by
fungi that he is scarcely recognizable: a shambolic lunatic, his limbs bloated, his torso glowing with bioluminescent toadstools. He is so slow, so large, and so riddled with
fungus that he would have difficulty leaving even if freed.
The constant fungal influences on his body and mind have
made him a frequent conduit of the Myconom (p38).

The Webs of Old Aunt Spindel

Sticky, silken cobwebs clot the woods, hung with decaying animals. A rank carrion fetor fills the air.
Terrain: Open forest (2), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 4-in-6 likely to
be with 1d3 giant spinning spiders (DMB).

Perilous Travel
The hex is a cat’s cradle of rope-like spiders’ webs. Gloom
is perpetual, and travel slow.
Webs: Characters may navigate around the webs, but doing
so increases all Travel Point costs (e.g. to search or leave the
hex) by 1. Otherwise, each character must Save Versus Hold
or become entangled in the rope-like webs (effects listed
under Old Aunt Spindel). When a character is trapped,
there is a 3-in-6 chance that 1d3 giant spinning spiders
(DMB) arrive in 1d3 Rounds.

Macabre Marionettes
In a web-swathed glade that reeks of carrion, the PCs come
upon a bizarre, macabre tableau: a group of people, some
moving stiffly and talking loudly and awkwardly, others
sitting and watching. Their clothes are threadbare, their
expressions blank and vacant, their skin of an almost moribund pallor. They are actually 12 marionettes of the hex’s
arachnid mistress, Old Aunt Spindel.
The play: The humans are acting out some sort of play
(comedy, tragedy, history, etc.)
The puppeteer: Concealed in a tree, Old Aunt Spindel
uses her little hands to twist and pull at strands of webs
connected to the marionettes. She takes great delight in
the rigid cavorting of these putrid servitors, and frequently
forces them to put on plays of her own devising, ventriloquising every part.
Interrupting the show: The marionettes attack the PCs,
while Spindel attempts to remain hidden. Should they be
defeated, she herself attacks.
Treasure horde: Stuffed in a sack in Spindel’s tree are
1,436cp, 802sp, 303gp, a fairy-silver necklace studded with
jet (1,400gp), a platinum ring bearing the Pollard family
crest (800gp—see hex 1209), and a Ring of Control (Fungi,
p410).

Old Aunt Spindel
Resembling a gigantic spider, Old Aunt Spindel has the
twisted face of a human woman, but in place of a lower
jaw, a pair of slender, childish arms extend, chelicerae-like. Her swollen bulk belies the predatory grace of
her movements.
Demeanour (Chaotic): At turns gleeful and morose.
Clearly mad.
Speech: Compulsively varying voices and tones. Can
throw her voice up to 60′. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: To feed. To enact and re-enact her sick performances. To become human once more (see Curse).
Curse: Old Aunt Spindel was once a travelling puppeteer, cursed to take this form by the capricious Prince
Mallowheart (p34) after one of her shows offended
the fairy lord. As part of her curse, she spontaneously
produces eggs, some of which hatch into giant spiders
that roam the hex.
Reward: If the characters are sufficiently silvertongued, she might spare their lives if they promise to
seek a way to reverse the curse.

Hollowed corpses, their delectable organs consumed,

wandered this way.

Poison: Save Versus Doom or die in 1 Turn.

All creatures in a flaming web suffer 1d6 damage.

Webs: Creatures caught in webs become entangled and
unable to move or act. An entangled victim who forgoes
other actions may make a Strength Check each Round
to escape.

The Balm Fields

1212

Lush meadows infused with the warmth of summer and the scent of blossom, even in deepest winter.
Terrain: Meadow (2), Tithelands
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Tom-A-Merry (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

Picnicking Herds
The last straggling copses of Dolmenwood open out onto
the flat, lush grasslands known to locals as the “Balm
Fields,” renowned for their vibrant populations of bees
and hares. Herds of cows, sheep, and their owners also
roam this region.
Breakfasting beasts: Those who wander among the meadows on clear, dewy mornings or drowsy summer afternoons may chance upon an odd sight: the cows and sheep
sometimes don hoods and bonnets and sit together, breakfasting on pickled eggs and ham or drinking tea.
Baffled herds-folk: Travellers who witness this curious
spectacle may also encounter the flummoxed owners of
the precocious livestock, invariably attempting to disrupt
the proceedings. (They claim that such unseemly behaviour among beasts brings ill luck.)
Asking the humans: Questioning the owners as to how
sheep and cattle come by bonnets, eggs, and ham—let
alone full china tea sets—elicits shrugs of befuddlement
and frustration.
Asking the animals: Those able to speak with animals
may question the animals about how they obtained such
civilised viands. This leads to roundabout, nonsensical
conversations, tinged with annoyance at the adventurers’
intrusion. Occasionally, the beasts allude playfully to “the
wee folk,” about whom they decline to elaborate.

The Golden Gazebo
Amid the gently swaying grasses and pretty wildflowers in
the eastern reaches of this hex stands a solitary structure
of artificial construction: a small, octagonal, radiant gold
gazebo.
Spiralling roof: The gazebo’s roof is adorned with spiralling seashells and goats’ horns. Fairies and demi-fey may
recognise this ornamentation as the mark of the fairy
Princess Andromethia (p34), whose realm, the Blossom
Fields, is coexistent with portions of this hex, including
the gazebo.
Interior: A dog-eared visitors’ book lies on an octagonal
table alongside a quill and ink. Benches around the edges of
the gazebo provide seating for twelve. A sense of contentment washes over any who sit within the shelter.
Reading the book: Page after page of questions, written
in numerous hands and covering a wide range of topics
(from the sincere to the flippant). Beneath each question
is a response, in gold ink, all written by the same hand
and signed with the initial “A” (the correspondent being
Andromethia herself). The responses take the form of snippets of whimsical poetry, vaguely alluding to the query.
Writing in the book: An answer to any question posed
magically appears at midnight. A positive Reaction Roll
(see Encounters, DPB—fairies gain a +1 bonus) indicates
a marginally helpful answer; otherwise the answer
is entirely abstruse. As the answers are composed by
Andromethia, they can only provide useful information
within domains of which she has knowledge.
Removing the book: If removed from the gazebo, the book
magically disappears at midnight, returning to its rightful
place on the table.

Shivering Bridge and the Burnt Mill

The mournful sighing and shivering of the river echo among the hills, like the chattering of ghostly teeth.
Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Shivering Bridge
A run-down wooden bridge spans the restless and
fast-moving River Shiver. Waves lap forlornly against
its skewed posts, and dark, churning waters are visible
through the gaps left by fallen planks. Crows perch here,
observing travellers quizzically.
Crossing: People and mounts can cross the bridge safely.
Vehicles have a 3-in-6 chance of collapsing it.

Burnt Mill
The burnt-out ruin of a stone building stands upon the
western riverbank, 100 yards north of the Shivering Bridge.
A smashed waterwheel lies on the bank, indicating the
building’s former function as a mill.
Approaching: The undead inhabitants of the ruin—a
cringing, mocking gang of 6 ghouls (DMB) and their leader
Jayne Turpentine, a headless rider (DMB)—emerge and
advance upon travellers. All are dressed in old fashioned,
decaying finery, with ruffs and lacy cuffs.
Interior: Blackened stone, tumbled walls, collapsed roof
and upper floor, smashed furnishings. The dirt floor is
ashen and devoid of plant life. The carrion reek of ghouls
permeates the ruin.
Trapdoor: A creaking wooden trapdoor gives access to the
Cellars, via a steep stone stairway.
Cupboard under the stairs: A door stands beneath the
ruined stairs that once led to the mill’s upper floor.
Behind the door is a small closet, strewn with gnawed
bones (human and animal). A decaying sack contains the
ghouls’ loot: 1,000sp and a silver bracelet studded with jet
(1,500gp).

Jayne Turpentine—Headless Rider
The hateful spirit of a highway robber, drawn to the
malign influence of the miller’s shade (see Cellars).
Manifests as a pale blue phantom dressed in old fashioned finery (with a ruff and lacy cuffs), shrouded in
mist, and mounted upon a spectral horse. Carries
her grimacing, gore-dripping head in one hand and a
bloody sabre in the other.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Haughty, hateful of all beings,
whether living or dead—including herself. Swings her
sabre brashly.

Searching: Reveals traces of magical script on a burnt
beam. Decipher indicates fragments of a necromantic
mind-bondage ritual.
History: The miller was a necromancer who dwelt here
with his coven of twelve apprentices. Religious zealots
burned the building along with its inhabitants 1,000 years
ago, but the spirit of the miller lingers in the evil tome
hidden in the cellars.

Cellars
A putrid, low-roofed space with a floor of dank earth and
walls dripping with mould. Shattered barrels are strewn
about.
Skeletons: The charred skeletal remains of thirteen
humans lay here: one tied to a stake in the centre (the
evil miller) and twelve around the edges of the room (his
apprentices—each missing a finger or thumb). A golden
medallion with a livid eye motif hangs around the neck
of the staked skeleton. (The eye weeps blood. Wearing
it grants +1 Intelligence and the ability to return from
death once. The wearer’s Alignment changes to Chaotic.
The medallion can only be removed by magic of curse
removal.)
Secret chamber: A secret door leads to a circular, shelflined chamber. A weighty, black leather tome stands upon
a lectern. Upon the shelves are dozens of black jars, each
containing a human finger or thumb, pickled in brine.

Desires: Murder. To release the miller’s spirit.

The tome: A spell book with the following spells, inscribed
in red ink which writhes when viewed indirectly: Knock,
Speak With Dead (p457), Animate Dead.

Possessions: The following items manifest physically
if Turpentine is slain: a bloody Arcane Longsword
(Doomed, p412—the blood cannot be cleaned), a platinum medallion in the shape of a horse’s head (1,000gp),
3 gold rings (100gp each).

Touching the tome: Any living creature who touches the
tome releases the trapped spirit of the miller. It manifests
as a writhing spectre (DMB), hissing “I come to serve you
now, O Flayed Queen.” If able to escape, the spirit flees the
mill and disappears into the hills.

Speech: Hollow whispering. Woldish.

332

The Vernal Chapel

1302

Colonies of doves roost in groves of silver birch, cooing psalm-like, communal melodies.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Worm-Mallow (p430), in addition to the normal results.

Ruined Chapel
At the centre of a fern-decked glade stands the forsaken
ruin of a chapel, its spire toppled in a heap of stones.
Approaching: Charmed, wild-eyed servants of the wyrm
that lairs in the ruin—3 Level 1 hunters (DMB)—hide in
the trees around the glade with shortbows and ambush
trespassers (opposing side has a 3-in-6 chance of being
surprised). They warn strangers against entering the
chapel, claiming it is forbidden by “Queen Incantral, Lady
of the Table Downs.”
Entrance: An ancient oaken door is held ajar by a thicket of
ground creepers. Its exterior is pitted with numerous old,
humanoid claw marks.
Interior: Smashed pews and floral columns, overwhelmed
with ivy and mould. Queen Incantral (blood wyrm—DMB)
lairs here, coiled around the altar, protecting her eggs—five
blood-red sacs glued to the altar.
Cleared door: A sturdy, locked door behind the altar—
cleared of ivy—leads to a narrow stair to the Chapel Crypt.

Chapel Crypt
A dank space, streaked with mould. Against the far wall sits
an altar, surrounded by the mounded hoard of Incantral
(see The Wyrm’s Hoard). Lying pristine atop the altar is the
lost Sword of St Sedge.
Frozen ghouls: 7 ghouls (DMB)—remnants of the undead
horde that sacked the chapel (see History of the Sword of
St Sedge)—stand paralysed at the crypt’s perimeter, poised
to strike the altar. They are paralysed by the sword’s magic,
but could be awoken by Dispel Magic.

The Wyrm’s Hoard
Coins: 20,225gp, 958pp.
2 arcane scrolls: One of Ingratiate, Web, and Teleport. A
second of Shield of Force and Perceive the Invisible.
Magic items: A dented brass Ring of Energy Resistance (Fire,
p410). A vial of Philtre of the Winds (p414). An Arcane
Shortsword (Werebane, p412) with a wolf’s head pommel
and a wolf-fur sheath.

The Sword of St Sedge
A gleaming Holy Longsword (Holy Radiance, p412)
imbued with sentience. Decorated with a scintillating
chrysoberyl on the pommel and raindrop engravings
along the blade. Worth 15,000gp.
Demeanour (Lawful): Passionate, devout, obsessed
with the myths of St Sedge.

Queen Incantral—Blood Wyrm
A mature blood wyrm with a regal visage of great
beauty and humanity, aside from bulbous cerulean
eyes, faceted like diamonds. Rows of purple blisters
pulsate upon her belly.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Boastful, protectiveness can
flare to ferocious violence.
Speech: Silky baritone, absolutely human. Woldish,
Wyrm, Sylvan, the tongue of serpents.
Desires: To protect her clutch of eggs (see Ruined Chapel
interior). To charm more powerful servants.
Vulnerability: Water.
Possessions: Key to the Chapel Crypt, hung on a
neck-antler.

Speech: Strident, metallic ringing. Woldish, Old Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: To be reunited with the lost shield and helm
of St Sedge (the helm is in hex 0408 and the shield may
be placed by the Referee as desired).
Touching the sword: Non-Lawful creatures suffer 1d6
damage per Round. A Lawful character who possesses
the sword must Save Versus Spell or come under a Holy
Quest (per the spell) to achieve the sword’s desires.
History: Taking vows of peace and poverty in his retirement, Sedge bequeathed his magic sword to the keeping of the nuns of the Vernal Chapel. Many years later,
a horde of undead descended from the nearby Table
Downs, sacked the chapel, and slew the nuns. A young
nun, Gryselde, guarded the sword with her life. Her
spirit lives on in the blade, granting it sentience.

The Woodwind Trees
Drifting melodies harmonise with the placid babbling of the River Shiver.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Woodwind Trees
This section of the wood is dominated by trees with vibrant
leaves ranging from bright pink to a reddish-violet. Their
trunks and branches are honeycombed with small 1″ holes.
Music: When the wind blows through the holes, they create
sonorous melodies. Animals flock to the trees, each singing
along in their own way. Songbirds twitter in their branches,
crickets chirp, frogs croak, and even flies buzz in tune.
Disruption: The incessant music makes it impossible for
parties to rest here. The music also disrupts magical incantations: spells have a 3-in-6 chance of failing when cast.
Magical wood: The wood of these trees is magical, and can
be made into Magical Instruments when cut. Woodgrue
and bard PCs know that some of the finest instruments
are made from the wood of such trees.
Cutting the trees: If any of the trees are harmed, the
song from all trees screeches to a halt and the forest goes
deathly silent. Animals are spooked and flee. A group of
2d4 woodgrues (DMB) arrive in 1d4 Turns to investigate.
Guardians: The trees are protected by the woodgrues who
dwell in the Treehouse. Their leader has an accord with the
woodwind trees that allows her to take periodic cuttings
from them to craft musical instruments.

Threeble Pidderpat (Level 4 Bard)
A woodgrue woman with wiry white fur, sleepy eyes,
and pale yellow ears. Wears a striped sock hat and an
oversized shirt with long puffy sleeves she keeps rolled
up. She is devoted to the trees that support her callings
as a musician and instrument-crafter. She believes the
trees speak to her through their songs.
Demeanour (Neutral): Easygoing, but quickly angered
if the trees are threatened.
Speech: Sing-song, peppered with flowery words she
doesn’t actually understand. Often waxes poetic about
nature’s beauty. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: To discover the best song in the world, to create
the best instrument in the world, and to protect the
Woodwind Trees.
Possessions: A wyrm-bone Flute of Revelry (p408).

Treehouse
The largest woodwind tree lies at the centre of the hex. 5′
wicker spheres hang down from its branches like giant
fruits, each connected by a lattice of rickety rope bridges.
Inhabitants: A band of 20 woodgrues, led by Threeble
Pidderpat.
Interior: Each wicker sphere is the dwelling of several
woodgrues, furnished with a nest of furs and leaves.
Common area: A central platform 20′ wide is built into
the boughs of the tree, covered by a roof of violet leaves
and illuminated by jars of twinkling fireflies. At night the
woodgrues come here to play their songs.
Threeble’s woodwind workshop: A wicker cone, slung
above the common area. Threeble offers to sell one of the
Magical Instruments she creates to anyone who can prove
their own musical talent to her with a song. Each costs
200gp. The instrument and effect are random—roll on the
Magical Instruments table.

The Hall of Sleep

1304

Crags of sandstone eroded (carved?) into outré forms like gesturing hands. A cool wind blows from the Loch.
Terrain: Craggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d6 portions of
Fenob (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

The Groaning Loch
Waters: Fathomless, cold, and unquiet.
Northern bank: The waves of the Loch lap against forlorn
beaches of black shingle.
Southern bank: Steep granite cliffs, 50 yards high, dwindling towards the east.

The Manor Road
A narrow gravel road connects Lochsbreth Road with the
Hall of Sleep.
Lined with poplars: Even on the cheeriest day, the deep
shadow beneath the looming trees that line the road
conjures a sinister and paranoid atmosphere.
Approaching the manor: The road ends at a gate in the
hulking, redbrick walls that enclose the manor grounds.
Through the wrought iron, one can see the manse slumbering amid its rambling gardens.
Guards: The gate and the grounds are watched by 2d4
sleep-wardens. A written invitation is required for entry.

The Hall of Sleep
The seat of the noble House Guillefer, secluded lords of the
northern reaches of central Dolmenwood.
Grounds: Gardens of exotic, flowering shrubs, little brooks
and bridges, folkloristic statuary, and dreamy idylls. The
place is infused with a sleepy, dreamlike atmosphere.
The daydreaming pond: A wide, placid pool lies at the foot
of the manor house, dotted with lily pads and (in warmer
months) buzzing with dragonflies. Pergolas and clusters
of seats surround the pond.
The manse: The Hall itself is a long, low structure of red
wood, overbrimming with white marble gargoyles in the
form of cavorting forest spirits.
Interior: Three floors of hushed, airy halls of polished
wood. Every room features a bed. Scents of cedar and
sandalwood permeate. Furnishings are sparse but luxurious. Despite a distinct lack of people, the place feels
content, if somewhat melancholic.
Inhabitants: The nobles of House Guillefer (mostly asleep).
A total of 20 sleep-wardens. Seemingly, a mere handful
of servants cater to the manor’s needs. Among the servants is a middle-aged lady’s maid, Sadewyn Gallbucket
(p77), who is secretly a high priestess of the witches of
Dolmenwood.

Sleep-Wardens
The honoured guard of the Hall of Sleep, clad in ornamental plate mail painted with blue flowers. Tasked to
rebuff unwanted visitors and ward the sleeping nobles.

Wand: The watch-leader carries a Wand of Vapours of
Dream (7 charges). All wardens are trained to use it.
Worth 5,000gp.

The Nobles of House Guillefer
The dozen nobles of the Hall take turns in ruling. When
not thus engaged, they sleep.
Sleeping nobles: The nobles sleep on the upper floor of
the Hall, in a maze of bed chambers, each guarded by a
sleep-warden. Their sleep is enchanted—they slumber for
decades and do not age. The servants feed them fortified
mead while they dream.
Rulership shifts: Each noble rules until one of their relatives wakes up and wanders bleary-eyed into the study to
relieve their duty.
The current lord: House Guillefer is currently ruled by
Lord Edwin Guillefer (see p59).

Visitors: Are not welcomed, and constantly hushed by the
servants. The lords of the Hall are reclusive and invariably
indisposed.

The Ravine of the Stag Lord
Ferns grown to extraordinary heights, towering above the heads of explorers.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.

Ravine of the Stag Lord
Deep in the trackless woods of the east of this hex, deer
paths lead to a secluded ravine. A winding series of ledges
creates a route to the bottom, where the folded strata of
the rock form a natural amphitheatre.
Grotto and pool: The amphitheatre faces a large grotto
lined with sparkling mineral formations. Much of the grotto’s floor is occupied by a wide and shallow pool. Detection
of magic shows both the pool and the grotto enveloped in
a spiritual aura.
Hoof prints: A multitude of hoof prints can be seen in
the mud around the pool. Most of the prints are those of
large stags, but the occasional giant, web-toed humanoid
footprint can also be spotted.
Those who touch the pool: Experience an icy chill and
must Save Versus Hold or the touching limb is paralysed
for 1d3 days.

Yorghan—The Stag Lord (Wood God)
A 30′ tall, lumbering humanoid with toad-like skin and
hands and great fronds of shaggy fur hanging between
its arms and torso. Its head is missing, causing the Wood
God to stagger and lurch. (For more details, see p39.)
Demeanour (Neutral): Slow, out of touch with the
modern world.
Speech: Gentle booming. Can communicate with all
sentient beings through psychic projection.
Desires: To maintain the wilds of Dolmenwood and
the dominion of the stags. To retrieve its head from
the clutches of Atanuwë (hex 0904). The retinue of
stags would enthusiastically join any who proposed a
mission to retrieve the head.
Reward: Any who return the Stag Lord’s head are
blessed with a set of magic antlers upon their crown—
treat as an Arcane Longsword (p412)—and granted the
undying friendship of all stags in Dolmenwood, as well
as the ability to speak their secret language.

New Moon Nights
On black nights of the new moon, 3d6 stags (red deer—
DMB—with Morale 8) trace the winding forest ways that
only they know, and make their way to the chasm floor.
There is a 2-in-6 chance they are accompanied by 1d4
deorlings (DMB).
Ritual: The creatures gather together and bellow in unison
to their master, Yorghan—the Stag Lord.
Manifestation of the Stag Lord: Heeding the call of its
followers, the gigantic, headless Stag Lord manifests,
emerging from the waters of the shallow pool in the grotto.
Stumbling procession: In the presence of their master,
the stags are transported in an ecstasy of worship. They
follow in a gleeful train as the Stag Lord stumbles blindly
out of the ravine and through the woods, until it vanishes
at dawn.
Enchanted antlers: During the procession, the stags’
antlers emanate an ultraviolet glow. Severed antlers function as a Arcane Longsword (p412) for one day before
losing their power.

Treating with the Stag Lord
Interrupting the Stag Lord and its retinue during their wild
cavorting is perilous—make a Reaction Roll (see Encounters, DPB). If the reaction is positive, the Stag Lord halts
to converse with PCs. Otherwise, stags attack PCs for 1d4
Rounds before continuing their cavorting procession.

The Willow Gate (Hidden)
A natural archway formed of intertwined willow branches,
swaying gently in a cool otherworldly breeze, can be found
in an isolated part of this hex. Stepping through the archway, one is whisked away to the fairy road Skipping-aDerry (see Fairy Roads, p26).

The Dung Heap and the Grey Monolith

1306

Ancient, moss-grown way-stones stand beside paths at regular intervals.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with either 1d6 woodgrues (DMB) making their
way to the dung heap or with 1d4 elf knights (DMB) in
the service of the Earl of Yellow (p32), clad entirely
in yellow and mounted on great golden wolves (as dire
wolves, DMB).
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Arrowhame (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

Woodgrue Dung Heap
Adventurers travelling through this hex notice an acidic
stench drifting on the wind. The source of this miasma is
a great mound of guano, 50 yards across, created by the
woodgrues of this region of Dolmenwood, who travel from
miles around to relieve themselves on the communal heap.
Woodgrue PCs: Recognise this landmark and its purpose.
Woodgrues seeking relief: There is a 3-in-6 chance of
encountering 1d4 woodgrues (DMB) nearby.
At night: There is also a 1-in-4 chance of a woodgrue revelry
(2d6 individuals) taking place here.

The Grey Vorpal Monolith
In the east of this hex, a 20′-high spectral monolith of
dusky, grey light hovers amid a small area of bog-land. This
is one of the mysterious vorpal monoliths that trace an
emergent fifth ley line in Dolmenwood (see Vorpal Monoliths, p19). In autumn, winter, and spring, the monolith
is a mere shimmering figment. In summertime, it becomes
semi-corporeal.
Viewing: All who behold the monolith in the summer
must Save Versus Spell. Arcane spell-casters gain a +2
bonus. Those who fail are afflicted with a curse of delusion
(see the Delusions table) and cannot be convinced that the
fantasy they are experiencing is not real.

Touching: In its summertime manifestation, the monolith’s partially tangible surface feels like cool glass. Spells
of illusion cast while touching the monolith are made real.
There is a 2-in-6 chance of creatures created in this way
being hateful of the one who summoned them to reality.
In other seasons, a PC touching the monolith’s diaphanous
outline temporarily experiences the warmth, humidity,
and brightness of a hot summer’s day.

The Refuge of St Keye

Spacious glades of majestic beech and oak. A profusion of songbirds, cheery twitterings fill the air.
Terrain: Open forest (2), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Wayside Monastery
Two miles from the edge of the forest, an old stone building
stands by the wayside.
Style: The building is fastidiously maintained, but with a
touch of austerity about it.
Entrance: Above an arched oak door hangs a sign announcing (in beautifully painted red calligraphy) “The Refuge
of St Keye—Pilgrims Welcome.” The door opens into the
Common Room.
Function: This is the only active monastery remaining
within Dolmenwood’s bounds. The Refuge is a popular stop
along the way between Castle Brackenwold and Prigwort,
serving as an inn for those travellers who can stomach a
little religion with their evening repast.
Origin: The Refuge was originally established as a monastery and rest stop for pilgrims on the way to the abbey of
St Clewyd. That pilgrimage route is no longer in active use
(as the abbey is ruined—see hex 0906).

Common Room
A wide taproom and refectory, filled with wooden benches
and trestle tables.
Guests: Of an evening, the place is teeming with travellers
stopping here for the night.
Casks: Huge casks of ale line one wall, where a team of
monks catch the seemingly endless flow in stone tankards.
Statue of St Keye: Above the cask wall hangs an oaken
image—twice life size—of St Keye the chronicler, bearing
his tome and quill, and looking down across the guests
with a beneficent but somewhat reprimanding gaze.
Evening Mass: Every evening at six, Abbot Spatulard holds
a brief mass in the refectory, blessing travellers on their
way and reading an extract from the vast chronicles of
their patron saint. Supper is then served from the monastery kitchen.
Exits: A door in the common room permits entry to the
Chapel of St Keye.

Chapel of St Keye
A narrow pilgrims’ chapel, lit by night with hundreds of
slim, yellow candles.
Walls: The stones of the walls are etched, in tiny Liturgic
script, with the entire text of the second chronicle of St
Keye.
Prayer: Characters praying in the chapel may receive the
blessing of St Keye: the ability to cast Locate Object. See
Shrines, p22.
Exits: A locked trapdoor leads down to the crypts, where
(it is said) relics of the saint are kept.

338

Services at the Refuge
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB). Only
private rooms are available (spartan monastic cells on
the upper floor, 2sp a night). Meals are always served
with freshly baked caraway buns. Dinner is seldom
available later than eight in the evening.
Monastery ale: Keye’s Balm (DPB)—1sp a pint.

Abbot Wiston Spatulard
A wisp-haired human man in his 60s, clad in rolls of fat
from a sedentary life spent drinking ale.
Demeanour (Lawful): Apathetic moralising. Desperate
to talk to someone new. Can’t keep a secret.
Speech: Interminable burbling. Sudden bursts of laughter. Woldish, Old Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: The secrets of the brewmasters of Prigwort. To
go back in time, marry his childhood sweetheart, and
forgo the monastic life.

Scoyfe’s Mire

1308

Trees are shaggy with yellow, hanging mosses. Visibility is low, with vapours hanging at head level.
Terrain: Open forest (2), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Noisome Pond
In the north of this hex, the ground slopes downward to a
waterlogged region of puddles and tussocks. In a dim and
damp glade sits a pond, about 35′ across, completely covered
in lily pads. Around its edges are many diseased-looking
orange flowers, all facing into the centre of the water.
Rising Scoyfe: Anyone dallying at the pond soon sees a
bizarre pair of figures arise slowly from the centre, known
in local legend as The Scoyfe. The pair bellow in anger and
attack intruders, pursuing them for up to a mile if they flee.
Treasure horde: Scattered about the bottom of the pond
is 1,000gp, mostly near a submerged, rotten, burst sack.

The Scoyfe
A pair of corpse-like men, one riding on the other’s
back, both draped in lilies and foul mire water. Though
the two appear to be in conflict, they act in unison.

The Hoary Gate

Undead: Immune to biological effects (e.g. disease,
poison) and mind-affecting spells (e.g. Vapours of
Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).

At the centre of this hex stand two 10′ pillars of glistening
ice, crackling with hoarfrost. The 5′ aperture between the
pillars is filled with a swirling, chill mist.

Immunities: Only harmed by magic, silver weapons,
or magic weapons.

Stepping between the pillars: Whisks one away to the
Prince’s Road (see Fairy Roads, p26).

Eternal grudge: In life, the two were bandits who killed
each other arguing over a sack of gold. There is a 1-in-6
chance per Round that the two fall to attacking each
other, vanishing in a puff of stringy ectoplasm.
Return from death: Can only be permanently defeated
if the corpses of both beings are incinerated. Otherwise,
both re-manifest in the pond at midnight.

Upper Being
A scrawny man cloaked in tattered bandages, with a
moon-like face and red-rimmed eyes. Sits astride the
Lower Being, holding a rusty knife at his neck.
Medium Undead—Sentient—Chaotic

Level 3 AC 13 HP 15 Saves D11 R12 H13 B14 S15
Att Knife (+2, 1d4 + drown) Speed 0 Morale 10 XP 65

Lower Being
A hulking brute, with long orange hair and a beard that
covers his entire body. Walks upon rough stilts, gripping at the Upper Being’s ankles with long, biting nails.
Medium Undead—Sentient—Chaotic

Level 5 AC 13 HP 26 Saves D10 R11 H12 B13 S14

1309

Thirligrewe’s Orchard
Bucolic woods decked with artfully trailing ivy. Sheep and swine happily browse the glades.

Terrain: Open forest (2), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Thirligrewe’s Orchard
At the forest’s edge, in a clearing surrounded by a waisthigh stone wall, there sits a tiny orchard. A humble two-storey cottage, leaning alarmingly sideways, adjoins it.
Strange apples: A row of gnarled crab apple trees bearing
curious mauve fruits stands at the rear of the orchard.
Cider brewed from the crab apples functions as Sandor’s
Phantasmal Elixir (p414). (One dose per pint consumed.)
Orchard tender: The orchard is tended and protected by
Thirligrewe Hangman, who serves Castle Brackenwold;
the orchard and cottage are the castle’s property. Her most
significant duty is the provision of crab apples, which she
delivers to The Roost, a nearby inn, for onward transit to
the castle. Should she catch PCs attempting to pilfer any,
she runs to the Roost for help from the staff there.
Weighty tomes: A passionate reader, Thirligrewe has
amassed a sizeable book collection whose sheer weight
causes the cottage to lean toward the side dedicated to
her study. Searching the collection for an hour yields four
arcane scrolls, tucked inside a horticulture manual: Decipher, Floating Disc, Arcane Cypher, and Perceive the Invisible.

Thirligrewe Hangman—Orchard Tender
A quiet, mousy human woman of late youth with wispy
hair and a penchant for berets. She works for the dukes
of Brackenwold, tending the orchard as a result of a
hereditary family punishment that passes to the eldest
woman in the extended family. The nature of the crime
that her ancestor committed—named pettymongery—
is long since forgotten.
Demeanour (Lawful): Rustic intellectual.
Speech: Halting, sarcastic. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: To continue her quiet job, which gives her time
to read from her extensive library. To learn the ultimate destination of her apples; all she has ascertained is
that they are spirited by courier to Castle Brackenwold,
where they are said to be used to create small but regular quantities of cider for consumption by someone
within.

Services at the Roost
Lodgings and food: Of common quality (DPB).
Attic suites: Private suites, each including a small
dining room, can be rented for 5gp per night.
Stabling: Excellent stables are located (at ground level)
in the woods behind the inn.

340

The Roost (Inn)
Half a mile from the orchard, in an open glade beside Camp
Road, a fantastic treehouse inn is nestled in the boughs
of a trio of old beeches. The atmosphere of serenity that
permeates the place is enhanced by the gentle cooing of
the flocks of tame doves that perch among the inn’s gables
and the surrounding branches.
Sign (at the roadside): A dove contentedly nibbling hazelnuts from an open hand.
Entrance: A sweeping, wooden stairway winds around
the largest trunk. For the audacious, a pair of rope ladders
dangle to the forest floor.
Common room: Tables and chairs densely clustered
around a sweeping, circular bar. The landlady, Zoemina
Ladle, serves with a gang of barmaids. On warm nights,
doors are drawn back, joining the common room and the
outside balcony. Genial flute music wafts.
Guests: Travellers, merchants, and guards. Adventurers
and nobles of romantic spirit sometimes sojourn here,
taken by the fanciful notion of living in a treehouse.

Zoemina Ladle—The Roost Proprietor
A strapping, energetic human woman in her late thirties, with plaited red hair and freckled complexion.
Dresses in green gowns embroidered with ivy leaf
motifs.
Demeanour (Neutral): Bold, spirited, gregarious. Flits
between groups, seldom finishing conversations.
Speech: Strident, almost operatic. Woldish.
Desires: The company of talented musicians. To
convince her lover, Thirligrewe Hangman, to fake her
own death, escape her inherited obligation to Brackenwold, and come to live at the inn in secret.

The Lodge of Granny Wolfsbane

1310

Bleached animal skulls nailed to trunks. Eerie quiet, as if the beasts and birds were all holding their breath.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. If the d8 roll for encounter
type indicates a Monster encounter, roll again.

Wooden Lodge
A cosy, cheerfully painted one-storey cabin, with neat flowerbeds flanking a short flagstone path to the door, smoke
rising steadily from a chimney, and an odour of toothsome
food in preparation. The structure is clearly solidly built
and its windows and doors are heavily barred.
Inhabitants: Lodge owner and retired monster-hunter,
Granny Wolfsbane.
Visitors: Granny Wolfsbane greets visitors with a crossbow
in hand, and pipe smouldering between her teeth. She
treats adventurers warily, especially arcane spell-casters,
but if convinced of the party’s good intentions, invites
them inside for a meal.
Main room: A kitchen with food on the stove, a sleeping
area, and the stuffed, mounted heads of Granny Wolfsbane’s many kills—crookhorns, a few trolls, two wyrm
skulls, and many wolves, their ferocious heads bristling
from the walls by the dozen. One of these belongs to the
werewolf ghost—the Moonlit Maw—in hex 1311. A large
wooden rack holds weapons of every kind, especially iron
and silver blades. On a shelf above the rack sit four dried
bunches of Wolfsbane (DPB).
Back room: Granny Wolfsbane does not allow visitors to
the back room. Should adventurers gain access, they find a
small stove over which a potion is brewing. Any spell-caster
can recognise the odour of Writhing Mandrake (p430),
which Granny Wolfsbane uses to control her lycanthropic
transformations (see Granny Wolfsbane—Lycanthropy).
Six uncooked portions of Writhing Mandrake can be found
in a pot beneath the stove. In a locked box next to the pot
are 1,218gp and a gold ring (450gp) bearing the crest of a
wealthy Brackenwold merchant family.

Granny Wolfsbane—Werewolf (Level 4 Hunter)
A scarred, sinewy human woman of 70 years, her white
hair draped behind her like a soldier’s flag. Horses and
other animals seem to dislike her scent. Granny Wolfsbane is a monster-hunter, an occupation she took up
after a wolf devoured her granddaughter.
Demeanour (Lawful): Cheerful and even ribald at
times; turns deadly serious when discussing monsters.
Speech: Gruff yet oddly genteel. Woldish, some Sylvan.
Desires: To defeat Old Aunt Spindel (hex 1211), whom
she (incorrectly) believes to be a rogue witch. To investigate rumours that a werewolf she slew long ago in hex
1311 is now a ghost that locals call the Moonlit Maw. To
ensure no one is harmed by her own lycanthropy (see
below).
Lycanthropy: Though Granny claims to be “retired”
due to age, her inactivity is in fact due to lycanthropy
(see werewolf, DMB), acquired during her last hunt.
She dares not leave her lodge for fear of harming those
she once protected. Her Writhing Mandrake potions
help control her transformations, but nonetheless she
sleeps with a silver bolt beneath her pillow, prepared to
use it on herself should her blood-lust grow too strong.
Knowledge: If the rumoured ghost is discussed, she
points adventurers to the werewolf’s grave in 1311,
though she warns it contains a “cursed” treasure. She
proudly admits to killing the beast and allows PCs to
take its head from her collection if they request it.
Combat stats: Werewolf (DMB). In human form, wears
leather armour (AC 12) and wields a crossbow.

341

1311

The Wolfweald
Placid rolling meadows, punctuated by groves of dark pines and damp hollows.

Terrain: Meadow (2), Tithelands
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters at night are 4-in-6
likely to be with the Moonlit Maw.

By Day
These green hills and golden meadows are placid and beautiful. Sheep graze in the shallow folds, tended by the handful of weather-beaten shepherds who inhabit the area.
Scattered corpses: PCs occasionally come across corpses
of animals or travellers, marring the pastoral tranquillity
of the hex. The corpses have expressions of terror fixed
on their sunken features and are shunned by worms and
flies, decaying very slowly. These are victims of the ghostly
Moonlit Maw.
Speaking with the shepherds: They fearfully refuse to
discuss the corpses, stating only that the PCs should “go
and tell Granny Wolfsbane” in hex 1310.

At Night
When night descends, the darkness seems especially fearsome and opaque, shadows lengthening like tenebrous
fangs. An eerie mist seeps from Dolmenwood to pool in
the region’s vales and hollows.
Howling: From sunset to sunrise, the fields echo with
unearthly howls, seemingly from some gigantic beast.
Sheltering shepherds: At night, the shepherds lock themselves and their sheep tightly away in their huts. Some
place corn doll effigies of the fairy Princess Andromethia
(p34), whose realm overlaps this hex, on their doors for
protection. They refuse to admit strangers.
Source of howls: A spirit prowls the Weald at night: the
ghost of a werewolf slain by Granny Wolfsbane (hex 1310),
known as the Moonlit Maw.

Grave of the Moonlit Maw (Hidden)
Atop a lonely hillock near the border of Dolmenwood
stands a plain wooden stele, emblazoned with a crudely
gouged X.
Digging up the grave: 5′ beneath the earth lies a headless
wolf skeleton, its rib cage filled with stones.
Treasure hoard: Tucked between the dead wolf’s feet is a
rotting sack containing 400sp, 1,411gp, a key to the kitchen
door in Bogwitt Manor (hex 1210), and a Sylvan Bracelet
(p420). Should adventurers claim any of the treasure,
every night until the Maw is defeated (see below), a random
party member has horrifying, realistic dreams of being
torn to pieces by the beast. They suffer a –2 penalty to
Attack Rolls on the following day.

The Moonlit Maw
This horror manifests as the spectral image of a ghastly
patchwork of flesh and fur, neither man nor wolf.
Unable to satisfy its hunger for flesh, the beast instead
gorges itself on the spirits of its prey. Their anguished
faces are clearly visible in its grotesquely swollen stomach, where they swirl in a ceaseless vortex, screaming
silently. The Maw hunts here and in hexes 1209 and 1210.
Medium Undead—Animal Intelligence—Chaotic

Level 5 AC 16 HP 34 Saves D10 R11 H12 B13 S14
Att Bite (+4, 2d4 + life drain + swallow) or howl (fear)
Speed 60 Morale 12 XP 560
Undead: Immune to biological effects (e.g. disease,
poison) and mind-affecting spells (e.g. Vapours of
Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).
Immunities: Only harmed by magic, silver weapons,
or magic weapons.
Life draining bite: Victim must Save Versus Doom or
permanently lose 1 Constitution. If reduced to 0 Constitution, the victim dies and is swallowed (see below).
Swallow: The Maw gulps down the spirit of any victim
it kills. The victim’s face appears in the ghost’s belly. The
victim cannot be raised from the dead by any means
short of a wish unless the ghost’s belly is deliberately
slit open with a successful attack dealing at least 5
damage, freeing the spirit.
Howl: Once every 3 Rounds, the Maw can howl, causing
all within 30′ to Save Versus Hold or flee for 2d6 Turns.
Holy spell-casters of Level 7 or above are immune.
Return from death: If killed (0 HP), the Maw re-forms
the next night. It can only be permanently destroyed by
burning its corpse: the skeleton interred in the Grave
of the Moonlit Maw and the severed head hanging in
Granny Wolfsbane’s cottage (hex 1310).

342

Andromethia’s Blossom Fields

1312

Acres of wildflower form broad swathes of colour, in contrast to the dark and shadowy forest to the north-west.
Terrain: Meadow (2), Tithelands
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Blossom Fields
A cheerful hill-scape of meadows carpeted in thriving
wildflowers: pendulous bluebell, daisies of the purest
white and yellow, powder-blue harebell, bright magenta
corncockle intermingled with spindly cow parsley, and
bracken leavened with pink and white foxglove. The air is
fresh and sweet with the flowers’ delightful essence.
Pathways: The seemingly wild fields are often bisected
by pathways, clearly carefully and recently maintained.
Fairy shimmer: Fairies and demi-fey notice an occasional
but persistent shimmering at the edge of their vision and
recognise this as an overlapping fairy reality.

Princess Andromethia
An eternally youthful, half-elfish / half-satyr lady with
a single spiralling horn above her left ear and the hoof
of a goat in place of her right foot. See p34 for more
details on the princess and her domain.
Demeanour (Neutral): Kindly, tricksome, judicious.
Speech: Soft, languid. Woldish, Sylvan, High Elfish.
Enjoys addressing people in fairy languages they
cannot comprehend, before tiring of the game and
switching to Woldish.
Desires: The recovery of her most cherished handkerchief, which she believes to be in the possession of her
wicked half-sister, the Lady of Spring Unending (hex
0402). The delivery of a note to the Ambassador of the
Cold Prince (hex 0504—she can give directions but does
not know how to locate or enter the embassy). The note,
written in High Elfish, consists of banal pleasantries
with a few double entendres sprinkled in. Oddly, it is
dated with a human calendar date, some 200 years past.
Reward: Andromethia awakens any sleeping party
members, and gives adventurers the exact location of
one fairy door (see Fairy Doors, p25).
Medium Fairy—Genius—Neutral

Level 14 AC 19 HP 75 Saves D4 R5 H6 B7 S8
Att Staff (+10, 1d6) or touch (+10, slumber) or magic
Speed 40 Morale 9 XP 7,550
Immunities: Only harmed by magic or magic weapons.
Magic Resistance: +4 bonus to Saving Throws against
effects of magical origin.
Slumber: Save Versus Spell or fall deeply asleep for 1d6
Turns—may be forcibly awakened (e.g. by slapping).
Fairy magic: Glamours Beguilement, Conjure Treats,
Disguise Object, Forgetting, Moon Sight, Seeming, Subtle
Sight, Lesser runes (thrice a day) all, Greater runes
(once a day) all, Mighty runes (once a day) Eternal Slumber. The Lady can also cast the arcane spell Vapours of
Dream without limit, Geas once a day, and the holy spell
Create Food once a day.

A Century of Slumber
The meadows of this hex are partially coexistent with the
fairy domain of Princess Andromethia and are under her
enchantment.
A contented tiredness: PCs who have exerted themselves
this day (e.g. by combat or long travels) must Save Versus
Spell (fairies and demi-fey gain a +4 bonus) or find themselves compelled to stop and rest among the flowers.
Those who rest: Soon drift off to a serene and dreamy
slumber, unless unaffected characters forcibly keep them
awake. Those who do fall asleep cannot be awakened (short
of the use of extremely powerful magic, at the Referee’s
discretion) for at least a century.
Princess Andromethia: Surreptitiously appears alongside
the party 1d3 Turns after any PC is ensorcelled in this way.
She awakens any sleepers and casts Geas on them, tasking them with a quest (see Desires). Should they fail, they
return to slumbering in the fields.

In Summertime
In the high days of summer, there is a 3-in-6 chance that
adventurers come upon Princess Andromethia and her
fancifully clad entourage of 1d6+2 attendants (stats as elf
wanderers—DMB), taking sumptuous meals and playing
games.
Greetings: Andromethia’s courtiers announce her title in
tones of exaggerated reverence as she modestly protests.
She greets the PCs warmly and invites them to join in the
festivities.
Bountiful hampers: Those who partake of Andromethia’s
picnic hampers find the food endless and exquisite beyond
any previously experienced.
Farewell: As dusk approaches, Andromethia and the elves
begin to vanish, unnoticed, one at a time, till all have gone.

343

1401

Fresh Graves
A weak wind carries the low, mournful cries of distant wolves.

Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Nighttime encounters are
3-in-6 likely to be with Grinstead, accompanied by 1d6
wolves (DMB).

Graveyard
Visible a mile south of the Downs Road is a lonely graveyard, surrounded by crumbling stone walls. Alongside is
the ruin of a small stone building (see Parr’s Ruin).
The graves: Ten graves lie inside the stone perimeter, the
earth of each freshly churned. The tombstones are crudely
carved with religious scripture, but no names.
Digging up the graves: Only one contains a body: a young
man, freshly killed.

Parr’s Ruin
The collapsed remains of an ancient farmhouse. A single
room remains intact, with a wooden door and shutters
recently installed.
Interior: Sparsely furnished with camping gear and
candles. A small bundle of religious texts lies beside a
bedroll. A door, obscured by debris, leads to a stairway
down to the Cellar.
Inhabitants: Sister Parr leads a solitary, miserable existence here.
Visitors: Parr warns off visitors without saying why,
imploring them to leave the hex before dark.

Cellar
A small stone room, stinking of rot and death. Dried blood
spatters the walls and floor. A jagged opening in one wall
leads to a warren of tunnels and wolf dens, with exits
among the surrounding hills.
Inhabitants: By day, the revenant Grinstead lurks here;
by night, he roams the nearby road, in search of victims.
Tunnels: In one den sits a chest (locked—Grinstead has
the key) guarded by 1d6+1 wolves (DMB). It contains 360gp,
494sp, 283cp, a sapphire ring (1,200gp), and a vial of Wyrmsblood Elixir (p414).

Sister Wilfrinda Parr (Level 1 Friar)
A gaunt, middle-aged human woman with an ill-maintained tonsure and sunken eyes. Dressed in hessian
robes. Her hands and fingernails are stained with dirt.
She is a captive of Grinstead, forced to consecrate the
bodies of the revenant’s kills so that Grinstead may
unearth and devour them. She bitterly knows he will
just find another priest if she dies refusing.
Demeanour (Lawful): Depressed and defeated.
Speech: Deliberate, weary. Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: To find the strength to escape.
Spells: Unable to cast spells, due to deity disfavour.

344

Grinstead—Necrophage
An undead revenant, originally a sadistic noble who
developed a taste for human flesh. Dark-haired, tall,
ashen-skinned, eyes a bloody red, seemingly in his late
20s. Dresses in finery, blackened with dirt. In undeath,
can feed only on corpses that have received a consecrated burial. Driven out of civilised regions, he has
kidnapped the friar Sister Parr, forcing her to perform
last rites on the bodies of travellers he murders.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Proud and manipulative. Long
past any sense of shame or guilt for his actions.
Speech: Strong, commanding. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: Fresh human corpses for the Graveyard. Alliances with the Table Downs’ fell denizens (such as the
wolves, to whom he feeds his victim’s mounts).
Possessions: An Arcane Longsword (p412) of cold
iron; “Vilin remembers” is engraved on the pommel
in Old Woldish. The key to the chest in the Tunnels.

effects (e.g. disease, poison) and mind-affecting spells
(e.g. Vapours of Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).

which arrive in 1d4 Rounds.

Mai-Fleur’s Unicorn-Hunting Grounds

1402

A profusion of holly trees bearing red berries in the autumn.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 1-in-6 likely
(2-in-6 likely at night) to be with a Wild Hunt (see hex
1502) in pursuit of 1d4 blessed unicorns (DMB).
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Sallow Parsley (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

Unicorns
Throughout this hex can be found the elegant blessed
unicorns kept by the fairy Duke Mai-Fleur (p30) as
stock for his Wild Hunts. The unicorns are prevented from
leaving the grounds by the gamekeepers, and by the magical disabling of their natural teleportation power.

The Silver Pool
Close to the centre of this hex is a serene pool of radiant,
glittering water. 1d6 blessed unicorns (DMB) drink peacefully, while 1d3 gamekeepers lurk uncomfortably nearby.
Poachers: There is a 2-in-6 chance of 1d4 poachers (as Level
1 hunters—DMB) from the village of Odd (p166) hiding in
the trees around the pool, eyeing the gamekeepers in the
hope that they stray from their charges. The horns, fur, and
flesh of unicorns are highly valued.
Intruding: Any who disturb this peaceful scene face the
wrath of the gamekeepers.
Drinking from the pool: Heals 1d6+1 HP. Mortals must
Save Versus Spell or change Alignment to Lawful.

The Dungle-Crack
A gloomy, 10′-wide chasm in the forest floor, whose base
cannot be seen. Nearby trees lean above the chasm, their
branches twisted and dripping with silvery dew.
Anything lowered into the chasm: Is whisked away to
the fairy road the Narrow Way (see Fairy Roads, p26).
A person who lowers part of their body (e.g. a hand) more
than a foot into the chasm is wholly transported to the
Narrow Way.

Gamekeepers
Monstrous black oaks with slitted red eyes that rarely
open. The gamekeepers are the most evil trees of this
hex, employed by Duke Mai-Fleur to ward his prized
stock of unicorns.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Still and dormant, springing
into action when poachers are foolish enough to interfere with their charges.
Speech: Cracking, grinding. They communicate only
with their elfish masters. Sylvan.
Desires: Guard the unicorns. Destroy poachers.
Combat stats: Treowere (DMB).

The Shrine to St Torphia (Hidden)
A simple wooden wayside shrine sits askew, 50′ up in the
boughs of a great, gall-infested oak, as if the tree sprouted
beneath the shrine and raised it into the air. The statue
that originally sat within the shrine is nestled in the tree’s
upper branches, 80′ above the ground.
Statue of St Torphia: 2′ high, carved of a single piece of
obsidian. Torphia is depicted kneeling in prayer, with
chains around her wrists and a heaping basket of berries
before her.
Prayer: If the statue is retrieved and placed in the shrine,
characters praying may receive the blessing of St Torphia:
the ability to cast Remove Poison. See Shrines, p22.

345

1403

Odd and the War of the Sprites
Trees festooned with dainty, glowing flowers of ochre, lilac, and mauve.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Village of Odd
A small cluster of thatched huts and animal pens nestled in
a glade, a low grassy knoll at its centre. Some 90 folk dwell
here, under the domain of House Guillefer (see hex 1304).
Fur and game: Odd is renowned for the fine furs and rare
game sold by its rustic inhabitants.
Full settlement description: See p166.

Along Lochsbreth Road
Sprites: Adventurers travelling Lochsbreth Road are
approached by 1d4+2 black sprites (DMB), who identify
themselves as members of the Grand Gupple tribe. They
urge PCs to follow them to their tree (see Sprite Lairs) to
hear out a “business proposal” (see The War of the Sprites).
Slumbering Bridge: A track diverges and leads to the Hall
of Sleep (1304), crossing Kewen’s Creek at an old, creaky
bridge overhung by sighing willows.

Along Follyegg Road
Anyone travelling the little-used Follyegg Road is met
by 1d4+2 blue sprites (DMB), who identify themselves as
members of the Timeless Twook tribe. They beg the PCs for
aid in a “dire situation” (see The War of the Sprites) and ask
them to follow them to their tree (see Sprite Lairs).

Sprite Lairs
The Grand Gupple Tree: PCs who follow the black sprites
arrive at the base of an exceptionally broad black poplar
tree. Minuscule huts festoon its branches. 80 black sprites
live here, lounging among the huts. They are a plain-spoken, assertive lot.
The Timeless Twook Tree: PCs who follow the blue sprites
come upon a tall, blue poplar tree. Homes made from floating puffball fungi cling to its upper reaches. 70 blue sprites
dally among the puffballs. Their demeanour is dreamy but
vaguely sinister.

The War of the Sprites
The two sprite tribes claim to have been at war for as long
as they can recall (in reality, it has only been three weeks).
Grievances: Each tribe complains about the Indignities
and Insults visited upon them by their enemies (see table).
Enlistment and reward: The sprites entreat PCs to dispatch
the opposite tribe once and for all, directing them to the
enemy’s lair. They offer the first listed Fantastical Treasure
as reward, but refuse to produce it until the party returns
with proof of their conquest.
Counteroffer: A party arriving at the opposing tribe’s tree
is met with protestations of innocence. This tribe claims
that the other tribe is really at fault, likewise complaining
of their abuse by their enemies (roll again on the Indignities and Insults table). They in turn offer the next Fantas-

tical Treasure on the list if the adventurers return to their
enemies and dispatch them, instead.
Back and forth: This pattern repeats with each encounter,
the promised rewards growing more fantastic as counteroffer after counteroffer is deployed.
Defeating a tribe: Each tribe defends its lair to the death;
each sprite killed performs exaggerated death throes and
vanishes. The conquered lair has no treasure. PCs returning to the tree of their patrons to claim their prize find it to
have completely disappeared and hear a faint tittering in
the breeze. Later, they spot members of both tribes, alive
and well, fluttering above and taunting them.

The Merrovore and the Glaring Pylon

1404

Forlorn tracks and fern-filled glades, dotted with milk-white, climbing vines.
Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with the merrovore.
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 2d6 portions of
the climbing vine known as Black Clover (p430), in
addition to the normal results.

Tentacle Heaps
Any who wander through this hex come across piles of
bloody, writhing tentacles in the shapes of people or
animals.
Alive: The things seem vaguely alive, but do not move of
their own accord, apart from the writhing.
Victims of the merrovore: These wretched things are all
that remains of those who have met the merrovore.

The Lair of the Merrovore (Hidden)
A pool of viscous, black fluid, almost completely opaque,
about 20′ wide and 12′ deep.
The merrovore: The monster comes to this pool to sleep,
submerging itself completely in the fluid. There is a 2-in-6
chance it is present when the pool is discovered.
Submerged in the pool: The merrovore guards a 2′ cube
of black metal, at the bottom of the pool. If touched by
an arcane spell-caster, the cube opens, revealing 72 tourmalines (100gp each), a set of three spell books (Rank 1
Firelight, Glyph of Sealing, Rank 2 Perceive the Invisible,
Phantasm, Rank 3 Dispel Magic, Lightning Bolt, Rank 4
Dimension Door), and a black silk robe that acts as a Cloak
of Displacement (p406).

The Glaring Pylon (Hidden)
A gargantuan, granite pylon stands amid a tangle of blackthorn and brambles.
Appearance: The pylon is square, 100 yards high, and 10
yards across at the base.
The glaring eyes: At the top of the pylon (invisible from
the forest floor) are carved four horrid eyes (one per side),
glaring out at the sky. One who sees any of the eyes must
Save Versus Spell or be struck blind for 1d6 days, their sight
blotted out by a vision of the awful, glaring eye. Witches
bound to Hasturiel are immune.

The Merrovore
A lithe, deer-like body (10′ tall to the shoulder), covered
in shaggy, white fur, with cat-like paws and a seventhonged tail. In its face is a single, crazed eye—deep
red—and a slavering, toothed maw. The merrovore
stalks the wood in this hex, gurgling and mumbling,
tracking by scent.
Large Monstrosity—Semi-Intelligent—Chaotic

Level 8 AC 14 HP 43 Saves D8 R9 H10 B11 S12

Aggressive: Attacks all it encounters (except witches,
whom it cannot see or smell).
Surprise: Anyone surprised by the merrovore automatically meets its gaze.
In melee: Unless averting eyes, characters in melee
with the merrovore meet its gaze each Round.
Gaze: Victims must Save Versus Hold or be transformed into a writhing mass of tentacles. (This is fatal.)
Averting eyes: –4 penalty to Attack Rolls. The merrovore gains a +2 bonus to Attack Rolls.
Mimicry: Tauntingly mimics victims’ voices.

Witches’ rituals: This is the locus of Hasturiel ThriceCrowned (p38), a deity of the witches who dwells in
inaccessible caverns deep beneath the pylon. On any
given night, there is a 2-in-6 chance of 1d6 Witches (Eyes
of Hasturiel, DMB) conducting a ritual here.
Solstices and equinoxes: On nights at the turning of
the seasons, the pylon blazes with blue flame and 4d6
Witches (Eyes of Hasturiel, DMB) worship here. Anyone
who touches the flaming pylon gains the ability to shift
into another form (per the arcane spell Polymorph) for up
to 24 hours.

Orbswallow and the Nutcap Colonies
A multi-hued jumble of giant, woody toadstools and tall, finger-like fungus.

Terrain: Fungal forest (2), Mulchgrove
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with 2d6 nutcaps (DMB), fluttering around nest-like
platforms of woven bark amid the branches of a grove
of silver birch.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions of
Devil’s Grease (p428) and 1d4 portions of Blood Canker
(DPB), in addition to the normal results.

The Village of Orbswallow
In the far south-east of the hex, the village of Orbswallow
nestles in a glade amid the fungal forest, clustered around
a pair of gargantuan toadstools and three magical trees.
Mosslings: Orbswallow is the centre of mossling culture
in Dolmenwood.
Full settlement description: See p170.

The Botanical Laboratory
A cluster of great sycamores, their trunks wrapped with
climbing fungus, stands close to the centre of the hex.
About 50′ up the trunk of the largest tree, a 3′ diameter,
perfectly circular hole can be spied.
Interior: The hole leads to a warm, wood-lined chamber,
connected by narrow shafts within the living tree to similar chambers above and below. This first chamber serves
as an entrance and meeting area, with mounds of sawdust
for seating, bark rugs, and dancing firefly lamps. Below is
an unlit bedchamber, stuffed with dried leaves. Above is
a botanical laboratory with glowing pea flowers, vats of
bubbling sap, and experimental crossbred seedlings.
Inhabitant: The nutcap priest, Creekeek, lives here alone
in this arboreal laboratory.
Visitors: Are welcomed for a cup of sap-wine, if peaceful.
Creekeek openly discusses the ongoing Conflict Between
Nutcaps and Mosslings.
The Elixir of Vegetative Life: Creekeek has succeeded in
combining the essences of the three trees of Orbswallow
(p170) to produce an elixir of life. Four doses are hidden
in the laboratory. To sentient plant-based creatures (e.g.
nutcaps), it acts as a Prismatic Elixir (p414). To others
(including mosslings), it extends life indefinitely by transforming the imbiber into a small tree. Each dose is worth
1,000gp.

The Fungal Grotto (Hidden)
Concealed in a dell filled with rotting, purple mushroom
debris is a 5′ high cave mouth.
Interior: A lofty cavern whose rough walls and ceiling
are clad with dainty toadstools that emit a soft pink glow.
In the centre is a 10′ high idol of slick red clay depicting
a 5-eyed, humanoid slug (the mossling deity Mbombre).
Inhabitant: The mould oracle (DMB) Gropoll.
Visitors: Mosslings are welcomed. Others are rebuffed
unless on a quest to aid mosslings.

348

Conflict Between Nutcaps and Mosslings
Multiple nutcap colonies dot the woods here around
the mossling village of Orbswallow. In an ongoing and
escalating conflict, the nutcaps launch aerial raids
on Orbswallow, snatching the delicious fruits of the
three trees. The nutcaps believe they have a right to the
produce of all trees in Dolmenwood, but the mosslings
disagree.

Creekeek—Nutcap Priest
A creaky old nutcap (DMB) with eight fluttering wings,
three sinuous arms, and head crowned with sprouting
oak leaves. Creekeek acts as priest, advisor, and healer
for the nutcap colonies in this hex.
Demeanour (Neutral): Slow, contemplative, curious.
Speech: Resonant clicks. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: Peace with the mosslings of Orbswallow.
Wishes to raise cuttings of the three trees for nutcap
use, ending the raids on Orbswallow.

Gropoll—Mould Oracle
A venerable mossling woman with maroon eyes, hair of
white mycelia, a great sentient yellow puffball atop her
head, and black skin wrinkled like the shell of a walnut.
Dresses in a patchwork of colourful fungus leather.
Mosslings from Orbswallow often journey to consult
Gropoll’s oracular wisdom.
Demeanour (Neutral): Jolly, enigmatic.
Speech: Erratic warbling. Puffball occasionally grumbles in agreement. Woldish, Mulch.
Desires: Word of any psionic giant snails (DMB) in
Dolmenwood. Seclusion in which to commune with
Mbombre. (Has no interest in the nutcap conflict.)

The Golden Wood

1406

By day, tiny golden sparkles drift down to the earth. At night, soft, green motes float into the sky.
Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with 1d4 elf knights (DMB) in the service of the Earl
of Yellow (p32), clad entirely in yellow and mounted
on great golden wolves (as dire wolves, DMB).
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions of
Knobbled Mandrake (p430), in addition to the normal
results.

Glowing Fungal Orbs
In the north-western half of this hex, the trees are
festooned, in all seasons, with head-sized, orb-like growths
of fungus.
Golden glow: The orbs emit a soft, golden glow, day and
night. It is on account of this glow that the region is known
to local folk as the Golden Wood.
At night: The ambient glow of the fungi is equivalent to
the light of the full moon.
Harvesting: Plucked orbs continue to glow for 24 hours.

Entering the Yellow Doors

The Yellow Doors

Adventurers with an invitation from the Earl of Yellow
may open and enter the doors. Without an invitation, the
doors are impassable.

The Golden Wood is a favoured haunt of fairies of all kinds,
due to the seven portals to the Fairy realm of Whyforth
(domain of the Earl of Yellow, p32) that exist here. The
Earl’s servants use these portals to come and go between
Dolmenwood and Fairy. The portals are concealed by illusion, but may sometimes be spotted.
Detection by passion: A mortal in the throes of an extreme
emotion (madly in love, religious rapture, abject terror,
etc.) has a 3-in-6 chance of spotting one of the portals when
travelling through this hex.

Size: Whatever their apparent size in the mortal world
(some appear no more than 2′ high), the portals allow the
entry of creatures up to the size of a knight on horseback.
On the other side: The portals in Whyforth are situated
in beautiful, natural gardens of semi-sentient plants that
may, at times, speak.

Detection by fairy lineage: True fairies (that is, not demifey) have a 2-in-6 chance of noticing the presence of one
of the portals.
Detection by magic: Spells of true seeing or detection of
illusions reveal the presence of the portals.
Appearance: A detected portal appears as a yellow-varnished door, complete with shiny brass knob and knocker,
in a natural hole or arch of some kind (a hole in the roots of
a tree, beneath the intertwined branches of two willows,
in a gap between two rocks, etc.).
Call of Fairy: Mortals who perceive a portal to Whyforth
(whether they enter it or not) must Save Versus Spell or be
forever stricken with a longing to leave the fields that we
know and get lost in Fairy.

Journeys Into Fairy (Optional)
Referees wishing to expand play into the realm of
Whyforth may allow adventurers to enter the Yellow
Doors without an invitation. This requires the Referee
to develop adventure locales of their own in Whyforth.

1407

The Henchgate
Clouds of black midges buzz overhead, making periodic dive attacks.

Terrain: Meadow (2), Tithelands
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

The Edge of the Wood
The flat plains and farmlands that surround Castle Brackenwold (visible upon a hill to the south-east) give way to
the great forest of Dolmenwood.
Horse-Eye Road: A major trade route in and out of the
wood. Follows the edge of the forest before plunging into
its depths at the very north-west corner of this hex.
The Henchgate: At the point where the road enters the
forest, a curious landmark—a natural gateway, known as
the “Henchgate”—stands astride the road.

The Henchgate
The gate is formed of the living trunks and branches of
dozens of trees, woven and melded together to create a
natural arched tunnel (about 30′ high, wide, and long)
above the road. It is here that many newcomers to Dolmenwood are granted their first taste of the queer atmosphere
that haunts the place.
Graffiti: The lower portions of the trees that form the gate
have been carved, over centuries, with the names, initials,
and love declarations of hundreds of passers-by.
Wooden faces: Above the scrawl, a profusion of quizzical
wooden faces peer down at travellers.

350

Greetings: It is common for the faces of the Henchgate to
speak, addressing travellers with their own names, in the
common Woldish tongue, and wishing them well beneath
the eaves of the forest. They are willing to make pleasant
small talk about the weather and such, but merely smile
quizzically if asked any questions.

Moriggan’s Crag

1408

Cheery, windswept fields of crops and scarecrows. Utterly flat, aside from a single gigantic rock.
Terrain: Farmland (2), Tithelands
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Moriggan’s Crag
An enormous boulder juts out of the flatness of the arable
plain to the south of Camp Road, visible for miles around.
Size: The rock is 100 yards high and almost 200 yards
across, with a flattened top and jagged sides.
Plants: The sides and top support a rich jungle of ferns,
mosses, and silver-leafed oaks.
Stairway: A stair—partly carved out of the rock, partly
consisting of hanging bridges—winds around half the
rock’s perimeter, ending at the summit on the south side.
Sentinels: 1d6 cragwardens guard the top of the Crag at
any time.

The Order of the Cragwardens
The top of the Crag has been guarded since time immemorial by the Order of the Cragwardens, a semi-secretive
militia composed of folk of an active age from among the
local farms and villages. The cragwardens call the Crag
“Old Mother.”
Loyalty: The Order of Cragwardens is loyal to the Dukes
of Brackenwold.
Duty: The Order is charged with two duties, both antiquated and defunct for many centuries. Firstly, they must
guard the Crag against invasion by fairies. Secondly, they
must maintain a cottage for the use of the Elder Phanatarch
of the Drune (a mythical figure to these folk).
Uniform: Scarlet leggings, pointy caps of green wool,
polished black leather cuirasses.

Summer Solstice
Upon the eve of the summer solstice (the 18th of Chysting),
local people build fires atop the Crag and dance through
the night. The cragwardens’ watchfulness is lax, at best,
on this evening.

The Drune Cottage
Upon the northern edge of the Crag stands a quaint, round
cottage of stacked stone, with a thatched roof and two
chimneys, accompanied by a small, walled garden.
Garden: Well-maintained herb and vegetable gardens. (Its
produce is consumed in the kitchens of the cragwardens.)
Interior: A single, round room containing a plump bed, a
fireplace and stove, an ancient, oaken armoire, a library of
curious lore (in Old Woldish), a mighty chest full of candles,
and a walnut writing desk and chair. A quill, inkwell, and
neatly stacked sheets of blank paper sit atop the desk.
View over Dolmenwood: Above the desk is a window,
through which can be seen the seemingly endless sweep
of the Dolmenwood to the north.
The spell book: One of the books of lore contains the
following arcane spells, written in Drunic: Rank 1 Ingratiate, Ioun Shard (manifests as a streak of green flame), Rank
2 Glyph of Locking.
Occupancy: The cragwardens keep the cottage clean and
hospitable, but even the oldest of their number have no
memory of it ever being occupied by the Elder Phanatarch.

1409

The Stinking Mausoleum

Beech and hazel, the ground littered with nut husks. The stench of carrion pervades the whole hex.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Stinking Mausoleum
Travellers can follow their noses to the source of the
stench: a circle of collapsed stone buildings.
Symbol: The motif of an eye ringed with thorns is carved
repeatedly into the ruined stone.
Tiled courtyard: Inside the circle of the ruined walls and
buildings, the ground is paved with white tile, now chipped
and greying with age, and pocked with errant trees.
Stairs: A single stairway can be spied, in the middle of the
courtyard, free of the rubble of the ruins. It leads down into
the dark of the crypts.

The Crypts
The courtyard stairway leads down to a network of
cramped, dripping tunnels, buzzing with flies.
Stench: The carrion reek intensifies. Characters who do not
mask the odour somehow suffer –1 to Attack Rolls.
Echoes: Gasps and moans can be heard sporadically in the
tunnels, echoing from the Central Hall.

The Central Hall
The tunnels converge on a 200′ wide circular hall with a
domed roof of cracked, pink porcelain.
Treasures: A glittering mound of coins and other treasures
is piled up in the centre of the hall: 2,000sp and 3,000gp
stamped with the head of the King of Brackenwold, 6
bronze torcs set with a black opal (1,200gp each), a twisted
ebony Staff of Darkness (p416).
The Descendant: Sprawled across the hoard, gasping and
lolling, is a giant and hideous being: the Descendant. If
disturbed by light or words, it rises and casts its malevolent, rotting gaze upon those who intrude upon its rest.

The Descendant
A 20′ tall, vaguely humanoid agglomeration of
maggot-riddled corpses, animated by a lust for living
flesh to meld with itself. Gurgles and gasps out occasional syllables in Old Woldish (“rend,” “flesh,” “bone”).

Undead: Immune to biological effects (e.g. disease,
poison) and mind-affecting spells (e.g. Vapours of
Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).
Regeneration: Heals 1 HP per Round, even when
reduced to 0 HP or less.
Kill it with fire: Cannot regenerate fire damage.

The Singing Spring

1410

Rugged, gently sloping meadows of rough, knee-high grass, crawling with insects.
Terrain: Meadow (2), Tithelands
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with 1d4 cockatrices (DMB) from the Cockatrice Nest.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Writhing Mandrake (p430), in addition to the normal
results.

Buzzing Wetlands
In the north-west of this hex, close to the forest’s edge, is a
damp-earthed region riddled with little brooks, alive with
croaking frogs and buzzing mosquitoes.
Singing: As travellers wander through this region, they
become aware of a choral crooning drifting on the wind.
Following the song: Leads to the Singing Spring.

The Singing Spring
At the middle of the wetlands, a spring bubbles up from the
ground amid a cluster of boulders. A group of 2d4 cockatrices (DMB) perch atop the boulders, singing jaunty songs
(see Cockatrice Songs) and occasionally pausing to slake
their thirst at the spring or returning to the nearby Cockatrice Nest in shifts.
Approaching: The cockatrices play up to an audience,
springing and bobbing in rhythm with their songs. After
each song, there is a 1-in-4 chance of the monsters suddenly
turning on anyone present (make a Surprise Roll). Should
the party clap or otherwise express appreciation, this
chance is reduced to 1-in-6. Despite their singing talents,
they cannot speak or understand language.
Drinking the spring water: Grants a beautiful singing
voice and inspires the imbiber to sing merrily (Save Versus
Spell to resist). Even normally mute creatures gain the
ability to sing in eloquent Woldish. Effects last for one day.

The Cockatrice Nest
A group of 20 cockatrices (DMB) nest in a copse of twisted
old hazel trees. Broken up chunks of petrified victims
(shepherds, travellers, deer, sheep) dot the copse, surrounding a cluster of six nests in the middle.
Inhabitants: 2d6 cockatrices are typically present, the
others out hunting or playing at the Singing Spring.
Nests: 8 cockatrice eggs sit in the nests (each worth up to
400gp to the right buyer), along with scattered trinkets
gathered from victims: 600gp, 2,100sp, a vivid violet Scholar’s Cap (p406), and a topaz-knuckled gauntlet (3,000gp).

Watering objects: Objects immersed in the spring water
likewise begin to sing. Effects last for 1d6 Turns.

Spindel’s Luck: The tragic tale of a puppeteer cursed
by Prince Mallowheart (p34) and transformed

Waltzing With the Scoyfe: The absurd story of two
waltzing bandits who murdered each other over a
sack of stolen gold. (See 1308.)

The Ruins of Chancton
Barely discernible remnants of pathway crisscross the hills—signs of ancient habitation here.

Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Wretching Bridge
A dilapidated bridge spans Kewen’s Creek. It rocks and
groans when crossed, but remains intact.

Ruined Hamlet
The Downs Road descends a gently sloping hillside and
passes through a small cluster of ruined buildings centred
around a rocky pool (see Healing Spring).
Ruined buildings: Rude homes, barns, and workshops,
their stone walls crumbling and wind howling through
their gaping orifices. The place has lain in ruins for over
1,000 years—interior furnishings are long decayed. Religious characters may note that there is no sign of a church
or graveyard among the ruins.
Skeletal inhabitants: The ruins are littered with the
intact skeletons of the hamlet’s former human inhabitants, posed in the midst of day-to-day activities: pushing a
wheelbarrow, digging turnips, tiling a roof, fetching water
from the pool, weaving woollen yarn, and so on.
Speaking: If anyone speaks within the hamlet, the skeletons animate. (See The Dead Rise.)

The Dead Rise
When awakened by speech, the deceased inhabitants (30
skeletons—DMB) unfreeze from their poses, dust off their
decaying rags, and haltingly approach living visitors.
Greetings: With the sound of rattling teeth, the skeletons
address visitors in Old Woldish (speakers of modern Woldish understand the odd word). They welcome visitors to
their hamlet, which they refer to as “Chancton.” They ask
visitors where they hail from and invite them for refreshments in the tavern and a barn dance later that evening.

Refreshments: PCs who accept the skeletons’ offer are led
into a half-collapsed building and jovially served empty
mugs of “Chancton ale” and empty plates of “sausage stew.”
If asked about their history: It becomes clear that the
skeletons have no idea that they are dead and no memory
of their fate. If confronted with this fact, the skeletons
laugh amiably, either dismissing the visitors’ “fancy Brickenwilde humour” or warning that their senses have been
addled by “too much time spent in the Tolmenwode.”
Barn dance: PCs who remain until evening may join the
skeletons in a dance in a cobweb-filled barn, accompanied
by the din of a broken fiddle and spoons clanking on rusty
trays. The skeletons are eager to dance with visitors, and
may even make marriage proposals to eligible PCs.
Moonlit bath: The evening’s festivities culminate in a
“recuperative bath” in the rocky pool at the centre of the
hamlet. (See Healing Spring.)
Staying the night: If PCs enquire about overnight accommodations, the skeletons offer them straw pallets in the
tavern’s mostly-intact back room. They proudly refuse any
payment. The remainder of the night passes uneventfully.
Leaving the hamlet: Whenever PCs decide to leave the
hamlet, the skeletons wistfully bid them farewell, return
to their regular tasks (digging, building, weaving, etc.), and
eventually stand once more still in death.

Healing Spring
In the centre of the hamlet, a spring bubbles up, forms a
shallow pool ringed with boulders, then flows in a small
stream to join with Kewen’s Creek to the south.
Bathing in the pool: Lawful characters who bathe in the
bubbling waters are blessed with either the curing of a
disease (including magical diseases) or the healing of 1d6+1
Hit Points. Non-Lawful characters are not affected; nor,
sadly, are the dead.

354

Duke Mai-Fleur’s Hunting Lodge

1502

Rugged knolls dense with holly. Blasts of hunting horns echo on the wind.
Terrain: Hilly forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 1-in-6 likely
(2-in-6 likely at night) to be with a Wild Hunt mustering
in the woods around the lodge.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions of
Gillywort (DPB), in addition to the normal results.

The Unicorn Gate
A pair of great oak trees stands atop a tall hill. Into the
living trunk of each tree is carved the likeness of a rearing
unicorn. They face one another.
Blowing a horn: Causes a brisk wind to pick up and a shimmering blue mist to fill the space between the two trees.
Entering the mist: Whisks one away to the fairy road Duke
Mai-Fleur’s Road (see Fairy Roads, p26).

Duke Mai-Fleur
A lithesome half-elf / half-human lord with ashen
complexion and flowing raven locks. The light of a
blazing sunset shines in his eyes. Dresses as a hunter,
crowned with holly and ivy. Mai-Fleur is renowned as
the most accomplished hunter in all Dolmenwood. See
p30 for more details on the duke and his domain.
Demeanour (Neutral): Wild-spirited, mercurial. Dreadful anger and heartening laughter are ever imminent.
Speech: Commanding, indignant. Woldish, Old Woldish, High Elfish, Sylvan.
Desires: To locate game worthy of a fairy lord (e.g. the
Stag Lord in hex 1305, the Bicorne in hex 0510).
Reward: One who aids Mai-Fleur may be gifted with
a magical hunting horn which, if blown, summons a
Wild Hunt to their command. This may be used once
only and works like the mighty fairy rune Summon Wild
Hunt—DPB. Worth 5,000gp.

Duke Mai-Fleur’s Hunting Lodge (Hidden)
A two-storey wooden lodge, camouflaged by the trailing
moss that blankets it. Even the windows are obscured.
Stepping onto the front porch: The moss peels back, revealing a polished black door, carved with scenes of unicorn
hunting and the holly-wreath sigil of Duke Mai-Fleur. The
door is sealed with a Glyph of Locking (Level 14 caster).
Interior: Passages, drinking halls, and three bed chambers,
spartanly furnished but replete with hunting trophies,
including three great black bears and two majestic
unicorns. Blue candles in wall sconces magically kindle.
Mai-Fleur’s Drinking Horn: At the centre of a drinking
hall table is a 2′-long horn of fairy silver, studded with pale
blue ice jewels. Once a day, water poured into the horn is
transmuted into exquisite, sparkling wine. Worth 5,000gp.

Mai-Fleur’s Fox-Hunting Grounds

Tree trunks covered with whorls and holes having the unsettling appearance of eyes and mouths.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 1-in-6 likely
(2-in-6 likely at night) to be with a Wild Hunt (see 1502)
in pursuit of 2d6 fairy foxes.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Oddy Sorrel (p430), in addition to the normal results.

Fairy Foxes
The fairy Duke Mai-Fleur (p30) keeps this region of his
mortal hunting grounds stocked with a dangerous species
of game: a breed of intelligent, anthropomorphic fairy fox,
some 100 in total.

Trapping the Trappers
The cunning fairy foxes attempt to confound the hunters
by strewing the forest with traps.
Traps: When PCs move through this hex, roll 1d6: 1–3: a
random PC must Save Versus Hold or be caught in a trap,
4–5: no traps encountered, 6: the party spots a trap.
Caught in a trap: The character is snared in a net or by the
ankle and yanked 20′ into the air. 1d6 fairy foxes quickly
emerge to ambush their prey.
Avoiding traps: Characters aware of the presence of traps
here may navigate around them, but doing so increases
all Travel Point costs (e.g. to search or leave the hex) by 1.

Fairy Fox Dens (Hidden)
The entire hex is riddled with cunningly hidden burrows
where the fairy foxes lair.
Entering: Only creatures of 3′ tall or less can squeeze down
the tunnels that lead to the fairy foxes’ dens.
Inside the dens: Each den is home to 2d4 fairy foxes, dwelling in a network of long, sandy tunnels, cosy lounges with
wood-crafted furnishings, little bedchambers with straw
nests, and larders stocked with hanging pheasants and
rabbits.
Treasures: Hidden in each den are 1d6 gems (50gp each),
1d100gp, 1d100pp, and 1d4 elf trinkets (DPB).

damage when hit with cold iron weapons.
Tactics: The foxes favour vicious hit-and-run attacks,
striking and then retreating into their burrows.

The Barrow Bog

1504

Sodden ground, stunted, twisted trees. Wreathed in perpetual mist and an eerie silence.
Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Use the Table Downs regional
encounter table in place of the Aldweald table.
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.

Ancient Burial Mounds
This hex is dotted with scores of barrows—ancient burial
mounds dating back more than 1,200 years.
Exploring the mounds: Shifting mists and boggy earth
reveal different mounds each time PCs visit.
Mound features: For each mound explored, roll to determine the Mound Entrance. Beyond the entrance, a stairway
descends to the tomb proper.

The Upper Brain of the Myconom

Enormous pallid toadstools sway eerily. Glistening fungal parasites strangle rotting trees and undergrowth.
Terrain: Fungal forest (2), Mulchgrove
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d6 portions of
Rotting Mazegill (p428) and 1d4 portions of Grinning
Jenny (p428), in addition to the normal results, which
are always fungi.

Spore Clouds
As the gigantic (30′ tall) toadstools sway with an eerie
rhythm, they periodically puff out clouds of spores.
Spores: Anyone entering this hex without taking precautions to avoid breathing in the spores must make a Save
Versus Doom or become infested with them until leaving
this hex. (Effects of infestation are described below.)
Infested animals: Animals scampering through the
undergrowth often sport small growths of fungus sprouting from their heads, like eerie white caps. Servants of the
Myconom, they watch intruders carefully.

The Upper Brain of the Myconom
In the central region of this hex, fat, white tendrils like
creeping worms writhe through the forest. Fungus has its
dominion here, obliterating all plant life. The unbridled
fungal growth in this region is due to the presence of the
Myconom (p38) rising to the surface.
The upper brain: At the centre of this hex throbs the
Myconom’s “upper brain,” a grotesque, pulsating, faintly
luminous enormity (100′ across, 50′ high) of white fungus,
receiving sensory input from millions of its tendrils spread
throughout the forest.

Characters infested with spores: (See Spores.) Can be
commanded by the upper brain while in its presence, and
fight to protect it.
Damaging the brain: The brain is so huge and has such
profound regenerative capacity that it can only truly be
harmed by extremely powerful magic (even a Fireball
would merely singe the surface) or other gargantuan
creatures. If destroyed, a new brain sprouts at a different
location over the next millennium.

Guardians: A group of 30 mosslings (DMB) dwell in the
depths of the woods here, their skulls split open by translucent green mushrooms that grow from their brains. They
worship the upper brain, which they call “Queen Shlobrot,”
speaking in unison in a cold, alien voice.

The Shrine to St Cornice (Hidden)

Reaction to outsiders: The servants of the upper brain
are indifferent to the presence of visitors, but mercilessly
attack any who threaten the brain.

Characters infested with spores: (See Spores.) If an infested
character enters the shrine, a swarm of holy beetles (insect
swarm—DMB) seethes from the moss-covered walls of the
shattered fane, attacking the intruders. The beetles are
otherwise dormant.

An overgrown shrine to St Cornice can be found in the
teeming depths of the region; though covered in moss
and lichens, the shrine is curiously free of the Myconom’s
pallid fungi.

Hidden compartment: An engraved trapdoor concealed
beneath the ornate, overgrown altar reveals a small, musty
space. Within can be found the Apron of St Cornice.
Prayer: Characters praying may receive the blessing of St
Cornice: the ability to cast Insect Plague. See Shrines, p22.

The Apron of St Cornice
This relic was worn by St Cornice in her days as a scullery maid. Anyone wearing it can speak with beetles
of any size and gains a +1 bonus to Reaction Rolls
with beetles (see Encounters, DPB). Additionally, the
wearer is treated as being of Lawful Alignment for the
purposes of interacting with unicorns. The apron is
worth 6,000gp.

The Ticking Wood

1506

Great, multi-hued fungal latticeworks stretch between the branches of crooked oaks.
Terrain: Fungal forest (2), Mulchgrove
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions of
Angel’s Lament (p428) and 1d4 portions of Velvet
Flounder (p428), in addition to the normal results.

Quiet Ticking
Beneath the natural sounds of the fungal forest—the chirruping of birds and the yapping of puggles (see Animals,
DMB)—a slow, resonant ticking, as of a clock, persists.
Source: Travellers may at times feel that they are approaching the source of the ticking, and may even hear it echoing
out from holes in trees or cracks between rocks. The source
is, however, elusive, and seems to shift over time.

The Clockwork Assembly (Hidden)
Giant, spotted mushrooms ring a steep dell, which is
coated in the turquoise slime dripping from them. Built
into one side of the dell is a 3′ high, slime-covered round
wooden door.
Cavern: Beyond the door, a sandy, root-lined crawlway
slopes down into the earth for 50′ before opening out into
a domed cavern, 100′ high, that houses the Clockwork
Assembly (the source of the ticking in this hex).
Inhabitants: Briglomb the Clockworker dwells here alone,
tending to the workings of the Clockwork Assembly. He has
no knowledge of its function or origin, but presents his
theories as fact, if questioned. See Hypothesised Functions
of the Clockwork Assembly.
Visitors: Are welcome, so long as they do not tamper with
the Assembly.
The Clockwork Assembly: A vast living machine of gears,
cogs, levers, clock faces, dials, and symbol-inscribed discs,
constructed entirely of polished wood, seemingly grown
from great roots at the base of the cavern. Briglomb scrambles up and down the scaffold of ladders, pulleys, and rickety platforms that surrounds the assembly, laboriously
polishing by the light of an oil lamp. A clangour of creaking, grinding, and ticking reverberates around the cavern,
and the smell of wood polish is all-pervasive.
Clockworker’s chambers: A small side chamber, riddled
with giant roots as thick as thighs, blanketed in a profusion
of glowing pink mushrooms. Little areas clear of fungus
house Briglomb’s bed (mounds and pillows of dried moss),
library (meticulous plans and notes relating to the Assembly), and pantry (jars of pickled fungus).
The Clockworker’s child: A path twists through the gears
and mechanisms of the assembly, down a stone stairway,
and to an unlit cavern beneath. Black-leafed ivy coats
the damp walls, clustering in a roughly humanoid shape
of tangled creepers, breathing slowly as if asleep. Upon
inspection, the form appears identical to Briglomb. It is
here that the Clockworker’s inheritor grows, in a manner
utterly alien to normal mossling reproduction.

Briglomb the Clockworker—Mossling
An ancient, gnarled mossling man (4′ tall) with a face of
polished wood, eyes like black conkers, a tangle of black
ivy upon his head, and knotted hands like wriggling
roots. Dresses in a patched leather apron and pointy
clogs, with a spray-can and polishing cloth in hand at
all times.
Demeanour (Lawful): Slow diligence gives way to jovial
agitation when in company. Habitually polishes his
nose, visitors’ elbows, and shiny objects.
Speech: Muttering, chuckling, and wisecracking (to
himself, when alone). Woldish, Mulch.
Desires: To peacefully carry out his duties to the “Great
Machine.” To learn more about Mr Klepp (p127) in
Blackeswell (hex 1604), who is said to share his passion
for clockwork.

Norstone
An infuriating profusion of watery ditches and mud-choked pathways.

Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.

The Unearthly Glade
Deep in the quiet calm of the airy beech woods in this hex,
a wide glade is overrun with sighing grasses. This place
has an odd air, feeling dreamy, welcoming, and yet also
somehow forbidding.
Unnatural sensations: Arcane spell-casters and fairies
sense something wrong or unnatural about this glade, as
if space itself were twisted or broken here.
Magical detection: Detection of magic, invisibility, or
dimensional warping reveal a 20′ dome of magical energy
at the centre of the glade.
Touching the dome: Once thus detected, the dome may
be touched, revealing a shimmering, silver door that leads
into a parallel dimensional space.

The Parallel Glade

The Audrune Morthgwail

Entering the door in the invisible dome, one appears at the
edge of a glade nearly identical to that in which the dome
stands, with a few key differences.

An old human man, stick thin and stooped, with missing teeth, goggling eyes, and a white beard to his belly.
He dresses in the traditional night-black cloak and hood
of his order. Morthgwail wanders the woods around
the nodal glade, living in the wilds without domicile.

Perpetual night: This glade is always veiled in night, lit
by a full moon.
Misty boundary exit: The glade is surrounded by mists.
Entering the mist causes one to reappear in the original
glade, beside the door in the dome.
Monolith: At the glade’s centre, where the invisible dome
is located in the real world, stands the Norstone.

Demeanour (Neutral): Eccentric, easily enraged. Tilts
his head to one side then the other when speaking.
Speech: Toothless whistle. Veers erratically between
topics. Woldish, Drunic, Old Drunic.
Desires: To repel intruders from Norstone. To learn
magic of shape-shifting.

Norstone (Hidden)

Combat stats: Audrune (DMB).

A great, square monolith of red/purple-striated stone—20′
tall and 8′ to a side. It can only be seen and accessed in the
parallel glade.

Servants: 2 dire wolves (DMB).

Guardian: Anyone approaching the stone attracts the
attention of the Audrune Morthgwail—the stone ward—
and his two dire wolves. There is a 3-in-6 chance of him
being already present (invisible) in the glade; if not, he
arrives from Dolmenwood within 1d3 Turns.
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Dimension Door. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18
for details on learning this spell.
Touching the stone: When touched by an arcane spellcaster of Level 7 or higher, the stone thrums, vibrates, and
exudes a violet plasma in which babbling, spectral faces
form. These phantoms speak in the Old Drunic tongue and
may be conversed with, revealing secrets arts for manipulating space and time (magic practised and jealously
guarded by the Audrunes). Conversing with the phantoms
allows an arcane spell-caster to reduce the research time
and cost of a spell related to these topics (including teleportation magic) by 25%.

360

Possessions: A twisted elm Staff of Dominion (Animals,
p416) with 7 charges.

Castle Brackenwold and Monarch’s Hill 1508
Tilled fields dotted with farms and little hamlets. Ancient stones with faded way-markings flank the roads.
Terrain: Farmland (2), Tithelands
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Castle Brackenwold
The fortified castle and keep of the Dukes of Brackenwold
watch over the southern eaves of Dolmenwood from atop
a steep, rocky hill, a great town sprawled below.
Town walls: An outer wall girds the town’s lower class
quarters, while a second wall wards the Inner City, home
to great markets, traders’ districts, courts of law, and public
institutions of learning.
Seat of the Duchy: The town is the capital of the Duchy of
Brackenwold, and the Duke of Brackenwold (p58), his
family, and court dwell within the castle.
Seat of the bishop: The Bishop of Brackenwold (p69)
also dwells within the castle, beside the Seminary of 100
Martyrs, where priests of the Pluritine Church are trained.
Full settlement description: See p128.

Monarch’s Hill and Erligstone
A mile south of the town, a wide hill rises up from the
surrounding fields, its sides clad with oak woods and
heather. As ducal property (at least notionally), the hill
is untilled, though flocks of sheep roam and graze here.
Summit: Locals avoid the top of the hill, where there
stands a ring of twelve ancient barrows with a standing
stone—Erligstone—at their centre.
Barrows: Low, grassy mounds, 20′ long and 10′ wide, each
with a crumbling, stone-lintelled entrance. All are empty,
save the northernmost—see The Grey King’s Barrow.
Erligstone: A 15′ high obelisk of rough granite, inscribed
with Old Woldish runes around the base: “Majesty. Fidelity.
Humility. Wisdom.” Lawful characters who touch the stone
are flushed with boldness and gain a +1 bonus to Attack
Rolls for the next 24 hours. Chaotic characters are bowed
with cowardice and suffer a –1 penalty to Attack Rolls for
the next 24 hours.
History: In the days of the Kingdom of Brackenwold (see
History, p14), monarchs were crowned upon the hill
before the Erligstone and were buried in the barrows
surrounding it. The site is now unused, and the early
monarchs’ remains long ago relocated to the crypts of
Castle Brackenwold.

The Grey King’s Barrow
Of the twelve barrows atop Monarch’s Hill, the northernmost is by far the oldest, having been constructed by fairies in ancient days beyond the reckoning of mortals.
Interior: A musty, low-roofed chamber, 10′ long. A cracked,
full-length mirror stands at the far end, framed with delicate filigreed unicorns.
Inhabitant: The barrow is warded by a shade known as
the Grey King, who manifests out of swirling dust if any
attempt entry.

The Grey King
The pale white shade of an aged human man, crowned
and with a beard to his belly. The shade was once a
mortal king and adept hunter, who befriended the fairy
Duke Mai-Fleur (p30) and was granted eternal life
(of a lingering sort) as warden of the entrance to the
fairy road. He has long forgotten his true name, but is
known in local folklore as the Grey King.
Demeanour (Neutral): Placid, well-mannered.
Welcomes discussion, but earnestly defends the
barrow—including with violence—if crossed.
Speech: Feeble wafting. Old Woldish, Woldish, Liturgic,
basic Sylvan.
Desires: To ward the fairy door. News and rumour of
the mortal world, especially relating to the nobles of
Dolmenwood.
Combat stats: Spectre (DMB). Bound to the barrow by
ancient fairy magic, the Grey King cannot be permanently destroyed. If killed or banished, he reappears
the following dawn.
Visitors: The Grey King bars further passage, demanding
all who approach to present the sigil of Duke Mai-Fleur. A
copy of the fairy duke’s holly-wreathed sigil suffices, for
example discovered in hex 1502 or by consulting the sage
Gemrand Soliquant (p153) in High-Hankle.
Those with the sigil: Are deferentially granted access to
the barrow, including the mirror within.
Those without the sigil: Are barred from access, though
the shade is open to polite conversation.
Touching the mirror: The mirror is a fairy door. Touching
it whisks one away to the fairy road Duke Mai-Fleur’s Road
(see Fairy Roads, p26).

The Deceiver’s Well
Agricultural land, alive with the chatter of milkmaids and the braying of animals.

Terrain: Farmland (2), Tithelands
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Shankswell Cross
At a major crossroads amid the farms and thorps of this
hex is a lively, cobblestoned market square. The place
bustles with local folk, trading, gossiping, and drinking to a
soundtrack of barnyard squawks and bleats. An especially
large crowd gathers around the dilapidated stone well that
stands at the centre of the square.
Stalls: Farm produce of all kinds (fresh rations), poultry
and livestock, local cider (1sp a pint), basic tools and equipment (e.g. backpacks, bedrolls, candles, chisels, cooking
pots, fishing rods, lanterns, oil flasks, ropes, sacks, torches).
Rumours: Travellers browsing the stalls or speaking with
the locals hear the outlandish rumour of the day—see
Rumours at the Well. If asked about the source of these
rumours, locals simply say that they “heard it at the well.”
In truth, these rumours originate with the whisperings of
the Atacorn Hawalyeer, secretly lurking in the well.
The well: Rusty rungs lead down 50′ to Hawalyeer’s Cave.
If a crowd is present, PCs may directly hear a rumour from
Hawalyeer, though it appears to come from the crowd.
At night: Hawalyeer creeps out to stalk the fields in search
of carrion.

Hawalyeer’s Cave
The well shaft pierces the roof of a natural cave, half-filled
with water. The Atacorn Hawalyeer lurks here on dry,
rocky ledges at the sides, among her obsessively arranged
collection of animal bones and broken toys.
Treasures: Hidden in a nook are 32 bloodstones (50gp each)
and a rusty, serrated Arcane Dagger (Lying, p412).

Rumours at the Well (d8)
All are utterly false and unfounded.

The monks of the ruined abbey of St Clewyd, deep in
Dolmenwood, were buried along with gold pendants
that lie untouched beneath the soil.
Sir Waverly “the Orange” (p152) seeks bold companions to quest with him into Hag’s Addle to kill the Hag.
A secret passage in the library of Harrowmoor Keep
leads to a profane cove beside the Groaning Loch,
where Lady Harrowmoor (p60) sacrificed her
daughter in return for dark powers.
Captain Bogle (p131) seeks live unicorns for use in
a spectacular jousting contest planned for the duke’s
tourney at Castle Brackenwold next midsummer.
A secret vault in the cellars of the Castle Brackenwold Magicians’ College contains relics magically
purloined from nobles, including the Hanglehorn,
long sought by Baron Hogwarsh (p60).
The Bishop of Brackenwold (p69) has come under
the spell of the Cold Prince and connives to summon
the wicked fairy back to Dolmenwood via an alliance
with the sinister Drune.
The first King of Brackenwold was interred in the
northernmost barrow atop Monarch’s hill. Relics of
his splendour remain there, including his sapphire
crown, buried somewhere in the tomb.

Escape route: The cave connects with an underground
waterway that runs through deep caverns beneath
Dolmenwood. If threatened, Hawalyeer may dive into the
pool to escape.

Hawalyeer—Atacorn
A scrawny, pallid monster, with a waifish maiden’s body
and the head of a donkey, topped with three ichor-dripping horns. Her eyes are milky white, as if blind, and
her shaggy ears droop to her shoulders. Wears a muddy
white dress and oversized hobnail boots. Hawalyeer is
a child of the Nag-Lord (p45), sent out into the world
to spread discord and woe.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Falsely innocent, spiteful,
deranged. Stares expressionlessly.
Speech: Can mimic any voice, but favours the sweet
giggling of a young girl. Woldish, Gaffe, Caprice.
Desires: Toys, games, and jokes. To spread bafflement.
Possessions: A twisted Ring of Amphibious Breath.

The Slumbering Giant

1601

Steep, bramble-clad hills interspersed with tranquil pools where woodland animals sup contentedly.
Terrain: Hilly forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Slumbering Giant
In the hilly north-eastern reaches of the hex, the mossy
earth quivers, and a rank, whistling, halitotic wind sways
trees and stirs leaves. Pursuing the source of the wind and
stench leads to the recumbent body of a gigantic (200′ tall)
humanoid: Fergus the Famished. The last true giant in all
Dolmenwood, he has lain here in deep slumber for several
centuries.
Appearance: Lain upon his back, with limbs splayed out
and great head resting upon the mighty trunk of a fallen
oak. Moss and lichen cover his body, and small trees sprout
upon the summit of his belly, which rises and falls in a
slow, snoring rhythm. His hair sprawls across the forest
floor in a tangled mass, slowly writhing with an eerie life
of its own.
Breath: The snoring wind and awful reek pervading the
region emanate directly from the giant’s nose. Those
coming within 10′ of the nose’s noisome exhalations must
Save Versus Blast or become physically ill and unable to
act for 1d6 Turns.
Chance of awakening: Climbing upon the giant or damaging him has a 2-in-6 chance of awakening him.
If awoken: Fergus furiously shakes off his blanket of
vegetation in 1d3 Rounds and rears up to his full height.
He seizes a tree trunk and attempts to bludgeon, kill,
and eat all present. He pursues any fleeing characters for
1d4 Rounds (though he may have trouble finding them
amongst the trees). He then roams Dolmenwood for 1d6
days, hunting and devouring large game and humanoids,
after which he returns to hibernation in this hex.

Fergus the Famished
An ancient giant of gargantuan proportions (200′ tall),
with shaggy, greenish hair, muscular, thickset frame,
and a prodigious pot belly. Fergus is naked but for the
curly hair that covers his entire body.
Demeanour (Neutral): Frustrated rage, fuelled in equal
parts by indignation and gnawing hunger.
Speech: A stream of bellowed, barely articulate threats.
Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: To avenge himself on those who dared awaken
him prematurely. To fill his insatiable gullet. To take
care of both needs at the same time.

Harvesting Treasures

Large Mortal—Sentient—Neutral

Those who dare meddle with a sleeping giant may be able
to harvest the following useful items.

Level 24 AC 14 HP 110 Saves D2 R2 H2 B2 S2
Att Stamp/fist (+14, 3d6) or tree trunk (+14, 4d8)
Speed 80 Morale 9 XP 5,050

Risk: Each attempt to harvest from the sleeping giant, roll
1d6: 1. Fergus awakes, 2–3: Fergus sleepily swats/kicks at the
character (roll a stamp/fist attack), 4–6: nothing.
Hair: The giant’s hair is extremely strong, immune to
fire and mundane weapons, and functions as a Rope of
Climbing (p420) for one week. Anyone cutting the hair
(requires a magical weapon) must Save Versus Hold or
become entangled in it for 1d4 Rounds (each Round, roll
1d6 as per Risk). Cutting any more than 10′ of hair at a time
requires contending with the giant’s Breath.
Fingernail fungus: A pungent, yellow fungus (Shaggy Sage,
p428) grows beneath the giant’s ragged, crooked nails.
Toe cheese: The grey clods of stinking sludge accumulated between Fergus’s toes are large deposits of the rare
Mawbarg’s Jam (p428).

Damage reduction: Suffers half damage from area
effects (e.g. Fireball), one-quarter damage from directly
targeted magic (e.g. Ioun Shard), and but a single point
of damage from petty, human-sized weapons, which
are little more than a nuisance (2 points of damage for
magic weapons).

The Giants of Dolmenwood
In ages long past, Dolmenwood was home to giants so
great that the trees of the forest merely brushed their
knees (300–400′ tall). In the modern age, no such creatures dwell in the region. Fergus the Famished is their
last remaining descendent—a mere stunted dwarf
compared with his titanic forebears.

1602

The Hill of Henlann
Paths wind around, up, and down a series of rugged hills dotted with wonky cairns.

Terrain: Hilly forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 3-in-6 likely
to be with 1d3 witches—eyes of Hasturiel (DMB) on
pilgrimage here.

The Sacred Hill
A low hill surrounded by dense thorn trees is situated close
to the centre of this hex. Witches consider this a sacred site,
calling it the Hill of Henlann. While the hill lies within the
hunting grounds of the fairy Duke Mai-Fleur (p30), the
duke and the witches pay one another scant attention.
Ascending the hill: Males feel their throats dry and
contract; speech is hoarse and stammering.
Urn and skulls: At the crest of the hill stands a massive
white marble urn, surrounded by a grisly collection of
skulls.

Skulls Atop the Hill
The skulls are actually those of thirty-five corpses, each
buried up to its neck.
Bleached and weathered: All of the heads are heavily
weathered and bleached completely white, having been
exposed to the elements, carrion birds, and other scavengers who dwell in the area.

The Rosy Gate (Hidden)

Missing jaws: Most of the skulls are without jaws, though
several are partially attached by leather-like ligaments or
green cords of copper wire.

Approaching the cave: Pushing through the briars to the
entrance, PCs notice the summery scent of wildflowers and
the cheery sound of birdsong emanating from the cave.

Ominous markings: The crowns of the skulls are
smeared with red clay markings, forming clusters of
cryptic symbols. One who looks at the symbols perceives
a momentary vision of being burned alive, their flesh
crisping. These ritualistic glyphs are regularly applied
by witches who serve the Gwyrigon Hasturiel ThriceCrowned (p38).

Augury of the Dead
Though they are blind now in the mortal world, the dead
of Henlann can observe events throughout Dolmenwood.
Standing paralysed atop a lonely mountain of black rock
in limbo, they peer through the ethereal mists of death.
Questioning the skulls: The dead can make report of
goings-on in Dolmenwood or answer specific questions.
They speak in unison, a rasping chorus of whispers from
beyond the grave.
The price of their service: Is an offering to Hasturiel,
whom the thirty-five watchers serve eternally. The offering
must be at least 800gp in value, deposited in the marble
urn. Offerings dissolve into a green haze that is swept away
by a forceful gust of wind.
Contacting the Gwyrigon: Hasturiel itself (p38) may
be addressed via Henlann’s skull-augurs, though the
Gwyrigon is only 1-in-6 likely to respond to a group of
non-devotees.

364

A tangle of wild roses grows around a yawning cave mouth
at the base of a gentle valley. Shimmering motes and rays
of light play around the cave mouth.

Entering the cave: Stepping over the threshold whisks one
away to the fairy road Buttercup Lane (see Fairy Roads,
p26).

Endstone and the Embalmed Hamlet

1603

Soft, pungent ground, littered with blight-mottled leaves. Sickly boughs heavy with swollen fungi.
Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.

The Hamlet of the Embalmed
About a mile north of Follyegg Road, a cluster of rickety
buildings sits on stilts above a bog, covered in moss and
lichens. Shadows stir in the darkness of the tiny hamlet.
Inhabitants: 21 Embalmed make their home here, led
by one who calls herself Bertha Bogborn. She runs the
hamlet’s distillery.
The Distillery: The Embalmed have a crude distillery made
from bits and pieces bartered from travellers. They make a
heavily peated whiskey which carries a necromantic effect:
if a bottle is poured down the throat of a corpse, the corpse
revives sufficiently to speak for 1 minute. A bottle is worth
400gp. The Embalmed will trade a bottle per week for
goods of equivalent value, particularly fine fur garments
from Odd (p166), of which they’ve heard rumour.
Peat baths: The Embalmed sustain their decaying forms
by bathing in peat bogs on the outskirts of the hamlet.

Endstone (Hidden)
Endstone is a 15′ high monolith of greyish-green rock,
veined with vivid crimson. It lies in a brush-choked part
of the wood, half a mile from the hamlet.
Guardian: The Audrune Mathonwy guards this stone.
Necromantic aura: Anyone who dies within a mile of the
stone rises again as one of the Embalmed.
Inscribed spell: Drunic runes describe the arcane spell
Animate Dead. See Ley Lines and Standing Stones, p18
for details on learning this spell.

The Audrune Mathonwy
A tall, gaunt human man in a tattered black cloak and
garments of matted badger-fur. Protruding from his
rancid body are knives and the hafts of broken spears.
He has been slain many times during his vigil over
Endstone, but always revives, often to slay his own killers (they, too, rise—some now reside in the hamlet).
Demeanour (Chaotic): Sardonic, patronising, sadistic.
Speech: Low, nasal hiss. Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: To protect Endstone at all costs. Consumed
with self-hatred for what Endstone has made him,
Mathonwy wishes to eradicate all other Embalmed.
He cannot leave his post, but may attempt to hire the
party to permanently incinerate the hamlet and its
people, promising treasure.
Possessions: A blazing, inextinguishable torch.
Combat stats: Audrune (DMB), with Embalmed immunity and undead traits.

The Embalmed
Those lost souls who have died near Endstone and been
resurrected by its necromantic aura call themselves
the “Embalmed.” They have rotting bodies, torn and
makeshift garb, and stretched, bog-blackened faces.
Their manner is shy but not hostile. They can never
leave this hex, or they return to lifeless carrion.

Immunities: Only harmed by fire, magic, or magic

Bertha Bogborn
A hulking Embalmed woman, some 500 years old,
with blackened skin, acid-bleached hair, and ossified
eyeballs with a tendency to fall out. Reeks of whiskey.
Demeanour (Neutral): Gruff but congenial. Beleaguered by the quirky, ancient personalities of the
motley crew she oversees.
Speech: Hearty, gurgling rumble. Woldish.
Desires: To be rid of the Audrune Mathonwy, who periodically sends lackeys to (unsuccessfully) destroy her
hamlet. She offers a party two bottles of her enchanted
whiskey to permanently slay him (only possible outside
the area of Endstone’s influence).

Blackeswell and the Drowning Pool

Dismal grey trees drip sullenly in the mist. Giant white toadstools encroach from the south.
Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Mulchgrove
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely to
be with 1d8 toad-children wandering abroad.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions
of Witch’s Purple (p428), in addition to the normal
results.

The Village of Blackeswell
An isolated and near-forgotten village, now subsumed in
the rapidly expanding fungal forest of Mulchgrove.
The stench of the Blacke: Situated beside a stinking, green
pool known as the Blacke, the village has an awful stench
that visitors cannot ignore.
Former riches: Once a thriving mining town, Blackeswell
now stands forgotten and half derelict, with only a few
stubborn inhabitants remaining.
Full settlement description: See p124.

The Drowning Pool
A black pool clotted with putrid grey-green scum festers
in the north-western corner of this gloomy hex, 100 yards
east of Armsheath’s Road. The place is shunned by locals,
who fear its sinister powers and rumoured undead inhabitants.
Inhabitants: 11 toad-children crawl and hop about the
pool’s periphery. If characters linger, they inevitably
attract their attention, as well as that of Grey Mayble, who
lurks just beneath the water’s surface.
Golden apples: The scum-splashed trunk of a bent old
tree juts out of the water at the centre of the pool, 50′ from
the shore. Among its gnarled, blackened branches shine
3 magical apples of solid gold (500gp each). If used as a
pommel stone, an apple endows a weapon with a +1 bonus
to attack and damage. If worn as a talisman, an apple functions as a Talisman of Protection From Hexes (p398).
Drinking the water: A mere sip of the festering water
incurs a Save Versus Doom to avoid becoming violently
ill: –2 penalty to Attack Rolls for 24 hours.
Entering the pool: Save Versus Hold or become unable to
move for 1d6 Turns. Unless aided, this results in drowning.

Grey Mayble
A wretched crone with grey, bloated skin, sodden,
algae-ridden hair, black teeth, and bulging eyes. She
frequently suckles a toad-child at her breast. Over a
century ago, Mayble was a Blackeswell woman who fell
in love with a priest and, after being spurned, drowned
herself in the pool. The weird magic of the place transformed her into a revenant.
Demeanour (Neutral): Jittery. Torn between her craving for mortal flesh and her lingering compassion for
mortals. Attacks if her toad-children are threatened or
if she sees a holy symbol of the Pluritine Church—she
loathes priests.
Speech: Gurgling, hissing, articulate. Woldish.
Desires: The return of one of her ghoulish toad-children who has wandered off towards Endstone (hex
1603). She tries to convince the party to find the errant
child for her—she cannot stray far from the pool.
Rewards: Should the child be returned, Mayble offers
the rescuers one of the golden apples.

Toad-Children

Medium Undead—Sentient—Neutral

1½’ tall, baby-headed amphibians with staring eyes,
small, webbed hands, and slimy, bulging brows. The
toad-children are normal toads transformed by suckling on Grey Mayble’s necrotic milk. They hop around
the pool and the surrounding woods, burbling with
voices somewhere between infants’ wails and croaking
toad-song.

The Fungal Chasm

1605

Rubbery black and deep purple antler fungi tower overhead, dripping sheets and strands of orange slime.
Terrain: Fungal forest (2), Mulchgrove
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Mossmulch (p428) or Wallowmost (DPB), in addition
to the normal results, which are always fungi.

Dripping Slime
Sticky orange slime drips from the gigantic (40′ tall) antler
fungi that dominate this hex. Before long, travellers are
coated in the stuff.
Wiping off: The slime is so sticky that it is almost impossible to wipe off, except with the aid of an acidic liquid (e.g.
wine, vinegar). The slime naturally rubs off over the course
of several days.
Consuming: Those bold enough to taste the slime find it
surprisingly tasty, with a sweet, nutty flavour. Consuming a large volume (at least a cup full) cures 1d3 Hit Points
(maximum once a day), but causes the character’s mouth
to become so gummed up that they are unable to speak
clearly for 1d4 hours (this prevents spell casting).
Harvesting: If collected, the slime loses its healing potency
after 1d6 days. Each dose is worth 50gp.

The Fungal Chasm
A great chasm, 100 yards deep and nearly 4 miles long,
runs north–south through the central regions of this hex.
Its sheer sides are clad with hand-like fronds of cyan and
violet lichen, dotted with small crevices in which tiny glow
worms nest.
At the bottom: The base of the chasm is a lightless avenue
of rich, black soil, creeping worms, and sprawling mounds
of yellow and orange ear-shaped fungi.

Inhabitants: The chasm is home to hundreds of diminutive fungal humanoids called holbies. Travellers in the
chasm attract an ever-growing following of the curious
creatures.
Encounters: While PCs travel in the chasm, any creatures
encountered are 3-in-6 likely to be above the party, at the
top of the chasm.
Eating the lichen: It tastes horribly bitter and is mildly
poisonous: Save Versus Doom or suffer fits of vomiting for
1d2 hours (–2 to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws).

Travel in the chasm: Following the natural path of the
chasm, characters can travel north or south through this
hex (to 1604 or 1606) with no chance of getting lost.

Holbies
1′ tall, incorporeal, translucent humanoid mushrooms
that glow a lambent green or yellow. Holbies have
bendy, jointless limbs and bulbous mushroom caps in
place of heads.
Demeanour (Neutral): Curious, playful.
Speech: Silent tittering. Appear to understand Sylvan,
but do not speak.
Desires: To observe travellers and witness the natural
beauty of the fungal forest.

The Whispering Caves
A pleasant beech wood dotted with heaps, mounds, and spires of sandstone.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Whispering Caves
In the side of a hillock at the heart of the hex can be found
the entrance to a series of caves, bored into the stone by
the waters of ages past.
Sounds of activity: The caves are uninhabited, yet are filled
with an echoing, sibilant mockery of the sounds of human
habitation.
Employing magical detection: Reveals an unfathomable
sorcery at work here.
Whispers from Brackenwold: The echoes heard in the
caves reproduce what may currently be heard in the chambers of Castle Brackenwold. If PCs spend time wandering
through the caves, listening, they may catch snippets of
a conversation of note (see Whispers in the Caves). The
identity of speakers is not obvious unless the PCs have
encountered them previously.

Burned-Out Hut (Hidden)
Half a mile to the south of the whispering caves, the blackened remnants of a small, burned-out hut stand in a glade
of horse chestnuts.
Moss corpse: A curiously humanoid mound of moss flourishes on the forest floor a few yards from the ruined hut. It
radiates witch magic, to those who can detect such things.
One versed in the lore of the witches may realise that the
mound is the remnant of a slain moss fetch—a doppelgänger created by a witch to impersonate herself.
The hut: Appears to have been razed within the last six
months. Its interior is overrun with freshly sprouted
nettles. Buried in the ashes is a sealed tin box containing
a 6″ tall corn dolly with a lock of black hair braided into it. If
released from the box, the dolly wails “mistress!” in a faint,
shrill voice. If placed upon the ground, it finds its way to
the location of its mistress in hex 1707 (though its tiny legs
can only carry it at a rate of 1 mile per day).

History: The witch Joab Elfwit dwelt here until recently.
She knew the secret of the whispering caves and used the
overheard whispers to blackmail Sanctus Primus (p71).
Clerics of St Faxis were sent to eradicate her, unknowingly
slaying her doppelgänger. She is now in hiding in hex 1707.

368

A noblewoman (cousin of the duke), in discussing her
niece with a woman with a common accent (servant), says that she “shows promise,” and should be
“introduced to the library” (see The Witches’ Library,
p130). The second woman warns of the rise of
witch-hunting under Bishop Sanguine (p69).
An elderly man with a grave, admonishing tone
(Bishop Sanguine—p69) mentions “the oubliette”
(p130) to a middle-aged, regal man (Duke Thespian—p58), who then begins to sob.
A gruff man (Captain Merriman Bogle—p131)
confides to a deferential man (soldier) his belief that
the “atrocities” of harsh longhorn rule in Lankshorn
(p156) make war “unavoidable,” and thus Lord
Malbleat (p64) will be “neutralised.” The other
man agrees, addressing the gruff man as “captain.”
A soft-spoken man (Abbot Hargle—p69) tells a
nervous man (acolyte) that Bishop Sanguine’s zeal
to destroy the Drune is “perhaps wrong-headed,
possibly tragic,” based on his research of “ancient,
mutual obligations” (i.e. the Triple Compact) between
the Drune and the Church. The nervous man counsels
caution, addressing the soft-spoken man as “father.”
A matronly woman recounts the tale of “poor Lady
Persimone” (the firstborn child of the duke and duchess), who died of terror as a girl following a visitation
by the banshee that haunts the castle. A gaggle of
serving girls gasp. (False. Persimone was, in truth, a
victim of the curse of the oubliette—p130.)
A noble-accented breggle (emissary of Lord Ramius—
p65) presenting a gift to a young noblewoman (the
Lady Zoemina—daughter of the duke), “from milady’s
humble admirer in the High Wold, with the hope that
it pleases her.” The lady murmurs appreciatively.

The Wandering Friars

1607

Ancient hazel and beech coppices, inhabited by a vast population of inquisitive squirrels.
Terrain: Open forest (2), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6
Ley line Hoad (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the feeling of having just awoken from a dream.

The Wandering Friars
As the adventurers pass through this forest, they sight a
group of 12 friars, arrayed in severe black, hooded robes,
making their solemn and deliberate way through the trees
and glades. They chant in (ungrammatical, to those who
speak it) Liturgic.
Hailing the friars: If the friars are spoken to, they stop, and
one of their number cries out: “You! Declare yourselves!
What have you done that pleases the One True God!”
Replying to the friars: A party that replies truthfully
with a sufficiently pleasing Lawful feat or accomplishment receives the Friars’ Boon. A party that lies or replies
with an evil deed receives the Friars’ Curse. A party that
replies ambiguously or insufficiently must undertake the
Redeeming Quest.
Following the friars: Those granted the Friars’ Boon or
who have completed the Redeeming Quest may follow
them down a hidden path to the Chapel of Redemption.
Others watch as the friars become transparent, fade, then
vanish completely.
Attacking the friars: The friars wait passively for their
doom. Each is killed with a single hit. Regardless of the
weapons used, no wounds appear on any bodies. The party
immediately receives the Friars’ Curse.
History: The friars were formerly a gang of bandits who
terrorised travellers on the Kings’ Highway. They took up
the mantle of the Church after receiving a divine vision,
and embarked upon a permanent quest for redemption
of self and other. The quest continues even now, centuries
after their natural deaths.

The Chapel of Redemption (Hidden)
Concealed in a dense bramble thicket, reachable only via
a hidden path, is a small, crude stone chapel, about 10′
square. A wooden door, carved with a figure of St Clewyd,
hangs slightly ajar.
Interior: Overrun with brambles. The walls are filthy and
the floor is covered in leaves and animal droppings. At the
far side is an altar; a wooden triptych sits upon it.
Triptych: The first panel depicts a group of twelve bandits
attacking a farmer in a wagon on a road, with Castle Brackenwold clearly recognisable in the distance. The second
panel shows the bandits sitting listless and remorseful in
a forest, a heavenly light shining down upon them from
above. The third panel depicts twelve black-robed friars,
wandering the wood.

Friars’ Boon
The recipients feel a calming warmth settle upon them.
They gain a +1 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls and
a +1 bonus to Morale for 1 day. They can also join the
friars’ procession (see Following the friars).

Friars’ Curse
The victims immediately double over in searing pain.
They suffer a permanent –1 penalty to Attack and
Damage Rolls and a –1 penalty to Morale, until they
complete the Redeeming Quest.

Redeeming Quest
Those charged are overcome with a vision in which they
see themselves carving twelve names into a wooden
staff planted in the graveyard of the Abbey of St Clewyd
(hex 0906). They find themselves physically unable
to enter any settlement until they have fulfilled this
mission.
The names: Ablegood, Barnabas, Chadwick, Crump,
Dimothey, Effred, Guillem, Hob, Jymes, Mug, Shank,
Wilfry.
Completing the quest: If the adventurers complete the
quest and return to this hex, they encounter the friars
again (even if they were previously slain).

Cleaning the chapel: Takes about two hours, and reveals a
wooden alms box, lost amidst the briars, containing 120gp.
If the party chooses to distribute the entirety of the coins
to the indigent, each member gains +1 Wisdom.

The Bad Apples
Windmills, wheat fields, coppiced lanes, and duckponds.

Terrain: Farmland (2), Tithelands
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Cidery Road
A side-road branches from King’s Road to the southeast. Next to it is a sign of weather-beaten wood, reading: “CIDERY ROAD—Home to the Famed and Esteemed
Titheland Cider.”
Following the road: Cidery Road wends its way for several
miles past apple orchards and farmhouses.
Apple orchards: Low, closely planted trees in sinuous rows
wade in mounds of rotting apples. No workers can be seen.
Eating an apple: The apples are small, oxblood-red, and
syrupy sweet. Mortals must Save Versus Doom—those
who fail die at dawn after sweet dreams; those who succeed
suffer an evening of nightmares.
Smoke column and odour: After 2 miles, the party sees
a column of smoke rising in the distance, and smells a
sweet, apple-scented odour. The smoke and the odour both
emanate from the Titheland Cidery, ahead.

Titheland Cidery
The road ends at a two-storey cidery of stone and thick
timber. Before it is the source of the smoke: piles of burning apples, stoked and fed by listless, dejected workers.
Alongside are several pens of pigs, feeding on apple scraps.
Speaking to the workers: They relate that last year, most
of the orchard workers who sampled the inaugural batch
of Titheland Cider (DPB) suffered screaming nightmares,
while a few enjoyed pleasant dreams before dying at dawn.
The workers now burn their orchards’ yields, hoping to
purge the trees of the blight that seems to infect them.
Reward: The cidermasters offer 1,000gp to adventurers
who can discover and eliminate the cause of the blight.
Examining the pig pens: The pigs become increasingly
agitated as the day gets later.

At Night
After the workers depart, the pigs leap from their pens, one
after another, to merrily trot about the orchards.
Following the pigs: Ultimately leads to a clearing that
glitters with fairy-light. There, the pigs gather around elf
courtier (DMB) Demozel Hazel, who holds court solemnly.
Speaking with Hazel: She explains that she and her
younger sister, Demozel Olive, are former ladies-in-waiting to the Lady of Spring Unending (p33), and are now
at liberty and seeking diversion; last summer, they took
up residence here. She admits to instilling the apples with
a magical horror, but is genuinely shocked if told of the
deaths. If asked, she directs PCs to Olive’s location.
Hazel’s directions: Lead to a grove where Demozel Olive
(elf courtier, DMB) reclines serenely on a bed of fallen,
rotten apples.

370

Demozel Hazel—Elf Courtier
Tall and plump, with long silver hair and a prominent
chin. Wears a necklace of pigs’ teeth, given as gifts by
the pigs themselves. She wears it to please the pigs, of
whom she is quite fond.
Demeanour (Neutral): Upright posture and frequent
pointing.
Speech: Precise, forceful, and erudite. Woldish, Sylvan,
High Elfish.
Desires: To enjoy the scent of nightmares on a brisk
night. To discuss philosophy with local pigs.
Possessions: A rose gold and pearl ring (900gp).

Demozel Olive—Elf Courtier
Tall and slender, with short golden curls. Wears a coronet of human teeth, extracted from local graves. She
wears it to put any humans she may encounter at ease.
Demeanour (Neutral): Charming, warm, kindly.
Speech: Full of tsks and tuts. Woldish, Sylvan, High
Elfish.
Desires: Kindly disposed towards humans, her chief
desire is to put them out of their misery, poor dears,
and into a nice dark grave.
Possessions: A moonstone necklace (1,000gp).
Speaking with Olive: She patiently explains that when
her sister isn’t looking, she removes the magical horror
from the apples and replaces it with deadly poison. She is
genuinely shocked that anyone would object to this.
Evicting the elf sisters: They can only be evicted by force,
or by providing them with very convincing, specific knowledge of better fun that can be had elsewhere. If either sister
is attacked, the other comes to her aid immediately.

The Grimalkin’s Revenge

1701

Grinning faces seem to manifest in tussocks, clouds, and puddles, vanishing when looked at directly.
Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with Hilda, furtively travelling between the Ogre
Lair and the Secret Cave.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d6 portions of
Groaning Mandrake (p430), in addition to the normal
results.

Distraught Grimalkin
After some travel along Downs Road, the party encounters the grimalkin Prissy Longtail, pacing in a circle and
mumbling to herself.
Speaking to the grimalkin: She says her litter were all
killed and eaten by a clan of ogres, whom she has tracked
to their lair nearby (see The Ogre Lair). She has taken terrible oaths and sworn vengeance on the ogres, and begs the
party for aid in this quest.
Prissy’s plan: She accurately describes the lair as a cave
in a nearby hill. She says the party need only distract the
ogres, so that she can enter the lair via its chimney and
strike from the rear. The party is free to keep all the ogres’
treasure. If the party follows her plan, Prissy proceeds to
the chimney, but reneges on her promise to attack, waiting
first to see how the adventurers fare. Only if PCs slay at
least four of the ogres does she join in.

Prissy Longtail (Level 4 Thief)

The Ogre Lair

Demeanour (Neutral): Manic, alternates between
mournful, vengeful, and calculating.

In a bare hillside overlooking the road looms the mouth
of a foul, bone-choked cave. A stubby chimney sits atop
the hill.
Inhabitants: A clan of 7 ogres (DMB): an enormous, cruel
matriarch named Aldheid (maximum HP, +1 bonus to
Attack and Damage Rolls), 5 loutish and cantankerous sons,
and a gentle-natured human daughter, Hilda. All are present except possibly Hilda, who has a 3-in-6 chance of being
in the Secret Cave, from which she returns in 1d3 Turns.

A chubby, sprightly, white-furred grimalkin woman
with goggling blue eyes. Witlessly pacing the hills of
this hex since the loss of her children, her fur is matted,
her dress rumpled and torn, and her armour ragged.

Speech: Rapid and distracted. Woldish, Mewl.
Desires: Utterly committed to the destruction of the
ogres, to the point of bloodthirsty obsession.
Glamours: Cloak of Darkness (DPB).

Hilda

Treasure: Under a pile of filthy, maggoty furs is a crude
hole in the cave floor. Inside are a golden locket (contains
a perfect cloisonné image of Chateau Mauvesse, 1,300gp),
3 sapphires (1,000gp each), and 650gp.

A 6′ tall, beautiful, golden-haired young human woman.
Should PCs attack her clan, Hilda does not protect her
family, but cries and grieves over their deaths. Given
a chance, she tells Prissy about her remaining child,
if the crazed grimalkin doesn’t kill her first. She also
freely offers the family’s treasure to Prissy as wergild.

The Secret Cave (Hidden)

Demeanour (Neutral): Taciturn, distant, glum. Gentle
disposition, unlike the rest of her family.

A mile away from the ogres’ lair is another cave. Unknown
to all, Hilda saved one of Prissy’s kittens, and has brought
it here to grow up far from the slavering jaws of the ogre
family.
Inhabitants: A single grimalkin kitten, which Hilda calls
Tommy Fluffkin. There is a 3-in-6 chance that Hilda is here,
feeding the kitten and cleaning the cave.

Speech: Calm and firm. Woldish.
Desires: To protect the grimalkin kitten. To guide her
family away from its brutal ways, or at least find a way
of living her own life.

Contents: Some canisters of dead mice and some crude
wooden toys.

1702

The Balming Grove

Milky fungal puddles and towering, lichen-coated fir trees, the bark near their bases notably shredded.
Terrain: Hilly forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6. Encounters are 3-in-6 likely to
be with 2 deorling stags (DMB) and 1d6+1 deorling does
(DMB). The stags duel each other over breeding rights
with one of the does, who observes and judges the fight.

Shadows of Howawi
In the perpetually fir-shaded hills of this hex gather the
mysterious and fading creatures known as the deorlings.
Though scarce throughout most of Dolmenwood, the creatures are drawn to this region. Amidst the hills, dales, and
dense woods, they engage in complex social rituals, including bloody duels over breeding rights, and veneration of
their patron deity, the Wood God Howawi (p38).
Locus of Howawi: The deorlings are attracted here by the
lingering presence of their god, whose essence they can
sense throughout these hills. Though Howawi is no longer
visible to mortal eyes, PCs feel something watching from
the gloom, and hunters may glimpse the shadows of giant
antlers.

The Balming Grove
In the north-western region of this hex, travellers perceive
a persistent chanting—low and sibilant, composed of
many voices. Following the sounds to their source leads
to a copse of fir trees, nestled among the hills.
Entering the copse: The fir trees have off-white needles and
are dotted with eternally juvenile, ochre cones, textured
like an infant’s soft flesh. The chanting emanates from a
broad glade at the copse’s centre.
Inhabitants: On this needle-littered ground, a deorling
doe matriarch (DMB), known as the Mother of Whispers,
and an ever-changing choir of 25 deorling does (DMB)
stand in a circle, maintaining an unending vigil of ancient
prayer to Howawi. At times, one or more members enter
the circle to perform an elaborate series of dancing
motions and wild gesticulations.
Visitors: Are immediately confronted by the matriarch
and 5 attending does, while the rest of the choir continues
uninterrupted. Unless interlopers offer profound apologies and a quick departure, or a tribute to Howawi, the
matriarch and her attendants attack them. Those presenting a suitable tribute may be invited to return on the next
new moon night for a reciprocal gift.

New Moon Nights
On the coming of the new moon, the does’ prayers turn
to wild ululation. The worshippers produce crude iron
mortars, pestles, and cauldrons. Toiling over these for
several hours even as they chant ecstatically, they brew a
restorative balm out of boiled bristle-cone, sap, and mouldcoated needle (see Deorling Balm, p402).
Invited guests: Each receives a dose of the balm.

372

The Shrine to St Primula (Hidden)
A 30′ deep sinkhole lies at the bottom of a dell tangled with
fallen trees.
In the sinkhole: The tumbled remnants of a pink-veined
marble shrine rest at the sludgy base of the sinkhole.
Beneath the pile is a beautiful (though lichen-stained)
wood engraving of St Primula and a herd of oxen.
Prayer: If the shrine is reassembled, characters praying
may receive the blessing of St Primula: the ability to cast
Remove Curse. See Shrines, p22.

Meagre’s Reach and Redhearth’s Rebels 1703
Serene pools overgrown with algae and lilies. Time seems to dawdle. A satisfied lethargy seeps into travellers.
Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.

Creeping Ennui
Those who travel in this hex note a sense of ennui, gradually increasing the longer they remain within the hex.
Fairies and arcane spell-casters: Realise that this area is
swaddled in deep magic, warping the fabric of time.
Local folk: The people of Meagre’s Reach and any others
born and raised in this hex do not notice the ennui.

The Village of Meagre’s Reach
A bustling village of antique, brick buildings, glazed in a
multitude of shining hues.
Old-fashioned ways: The elderly outnumber the young in
Meagre’s Reach. Odd, long-outmoded forms of speech and
dress are still current in the village.
Clay and bricks: Located in the vicinity of several rich clay
beds, the village thrives on clay mining and brickmaking.
Full settlement description: See p162.

Redhearth’s Rebels
A group of dissidents known as Redhearth’s Rebels (see
p164) has established a makeshift encampment in the
woods to the west of the village. The gang members believe
Ygraine (p84) keeps Meagre’s Reach under her spell as a
plaything, entrapping its people for her own wicked ends.
Inhabitants: The gang’s deputy, Gemyme Grange, and 2d6
rebels (Level 1 thieves—DMB). There is a 2-in-6 chance that
the leader, Benedict Redhearth (p164), is present.

Gemyme Grange—Gang Deputy
(Level 1 Fighter)
A limber, fox-faced human woman of 18, with ice blue
eyes, cropped blonde hair, and a silver ring through her
nose. Dresses in soggy leathers and an oversized bearskin cloak. Gemyme seeks to push the gang to action,
despite their lack of training, preparation, and concrete
plans. While currently devoted to Redhearth, she could
easily be swayed to another cause if promised excitement and danger.

Encampment: A sorry-looking cluster of sodden tents,
erected on lumpy, root-riddled slopes to avoid boggy
ground. Gang members typically convene around a fire
pit, skinning game, cooking stews in a cauldron, and practising archery. Redhearth’s visits always include hours of
impassioned preaching and diatribes against Ygraine’s
wickedness.
Equipment stashes: Hoisted into the branches of nearby
trees are several tarpaulins of equipment: ropes, tools,
shortswords, leather armour.
Visitors: Are initially treated cautiously, under the suspicion that they may be spies or ruffians sent by Reynold
Barhaim (p162)—the village’s leading citizen and
primary Ygraine loyalist—to disrupt the gang’s plans.
If convinced that this is not the case, the gang welcome
outsiders, evangelising their cause and asking for aid in the
form of weapons, equipment, or intelligence on Chateau
Mauvesse and the doings of Ygraine.

Demeanour (Neutral): Suspicious, domineering, bored.
Speech: Snide. Woldish.
Knowledge: Has witnessed Lope Barhaim (son of
Reynold—p162) furtively leaving Meagre’s Reach,
seemingly on his way to Chateau Mauvesse. Aware that
all others who venture beyond this hex never return.
Desires: Adventure and derring-do. Knowledge of the
secret used by Barhaim and his sons to safely leave
the vicinity of Meagre’s Reach. Yearns to escape the
confines of this hex and explore the wider world.

1704

The King of the Woodgrues
Sandstone crags protrude from stinking, fly-infested bogs.

Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6

Music on the Wind
Eccentric pipe music drifts on the wind in the central
regions of this hex. Long beards of moss drape the trees
and seem to sway in unison with it.
Pipe music: During the daytime, gentle, curlicued lullabies. At night, wild, up-tempo warbling and screeching.
Following: The music emanates from the yawning mouth
of a cavern in the steep side of a crag of rock that juts from
the bog: see The King’s Grotto.

The King’s Grotto
A vault-like cavern with a 40′ high, layered ceiling, decked
with giant stalactites. Troupes of capering woodgrue
pipers play music day and night. Vats of steaming, spiced
mead and mounds of furs line the walls. The place reeks of
guano, sweat, and honey.
Host: King Ogglewoop—self-styled “king of all woodgrues”—perches upon a throne of artfully arranged
stalactites and massive quartz chunks (5,000gp), gleefully
observing the merrymaking.
Guests: A madcap gaggle of 2d3 × 10 woodgrues (DMB),
prancing, imbibing, and whooping by night, lounging and
snoring by day. Half the guests are zealous followers of
Ogglewoop and most others are indifferent to his claims,
merely wishing to carouse. A few are spies sent by the
woodgrue elders to discredit this supposed “king.”
Non-woodgrues: Are welcomed, as long as they do not
spoil the fun.

The Shrine to St Whittery (Hidden)
A white marble hand in a gesture of benediction protrudes
from the jumbled roots of a large oak.
Examination: Reveals that the hand is part of a statue,
apparently buried among the roots.
Extracting: Six hours of digging and cutting away the roots
unearths a wooden wayside shrine with a lifesize marble
statue of St Whittery, depicted as a beatific youth holding
an ornate chamberstick.
Prayer: If the shrine is unearthed, characters praying may
receive the blessing of St Whittery: the ability to cast Detect
Evil. See Shrines, p22.

Services at The King’s Grotto
Food: Of poor quality (DPB). All dishes served with a
sprinkling of powdered moth wings.
Spiced mead: 1gp a mug.
Lodgings: A flop space can usually be found (free of
charge) on the mounds of furs at the sides of the grotto,
though privacy is impossible and decent rest is hard
to come by.

King Ogglewoop (Level 7 Fighter)
A hefty (5′ tall) woodgrue man with a giant pot-belly,
floppy jowls, thick orange fur, and pupilless eyes of pure
white. Dresses in a snakeskin cape, a bent brass crown,
and a codpiece in the shape of a shocked gargoyle’s
visage. Ogglewoop claims to be an emissary of the
Goblin King (p32) with leave to rule over woodgrues
in the mortal world. He is a fraud and has in fact never
visited Fairy.
Demeanour (Neutral): Mirthful, mercurial. Affected
and bombastic majesty.
Speech: Brash whooping, uproarious laughter. Woldish,
Sylvan.
Desires: To avoid the attention of genuine kings, dukes,
etc. (including, of course, the Goblin King). The adoration of all. Schemes to bring the Embalmed (hex 1603)
into his service by livening up their tedious existence
with raucous festivities.
Possessions: A Fairy Sling (p412). 10 bejewelled rings:
one a Ring of Invisibility (p410), the others mundane
(though valuable—worth 1,000gp each). A Talisman of
Spell Reflection (p398, 5 charges left).

374

Stinkhorn Woods

1705

Gargantuan, phallic, brown-and-cream fungi. Flies buzz. The place stinks of carrion.
Terrain: Fungal forest (2), Mulchgrove
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 3-in-6 likely
to be with 2d10 giant blood-sucking flies (as stirges—
DMB) or 1d8 giant burrowing beetles (DMB).
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d4 portions of
Blood Canker (DPB) or Puck’s Ear (p428), in addition
to the normal results, which are always fungi.

Songs of the Stinkhorns
As characters travel through this hex, they notice a sighing
coming from the tops of the stinkhorns, gradually increasing in frequency and volume. After an hour of travel,
the sighing exhibits a definitive melody, with Woldish
words soon becoming recognisable. Soon, the stinkhorns
throughout the hex are singing a faint, breezy lullaby in
unison (see Fungal Lullabies).

The Shrine to St Jorrael (Hidden)
Subsumed beneath a slimy mound of rotting, collapsed
stinkhorn trunks is the lost shrine to St Jorrael.
Structure: A white marble mausoleum whose exquisitely
carved pillars depict a righteous peasant horde rising up
against their wicked liege. The door is stuck (see Doors,
DPB).
Statue of St Jorrael: A once beautiful marble statue lies in
pieces, shattered on the floor. The saint’s plaintive visage
looks directly up at those who enter, her eyes seeming to
twinkle in the light.

Fungal Lullabies (d6)
d6 Lullaby
1

A lament for the imminent deaths of the party, each
individual mentioned by name.
A maddening, rasping taunt of “Babes in the woods!”
The party’s leader or navigator must Save Versus
Spell. If the save fails, the party becomes lost.
Lyrics describing shadows rising up from the dank
earth, seeking to destroy the party. All characters
must Save Versus Spell. For each save that fails, a
shadow (DMB) manifests, stalking the party for a
time before attacking.
A sweet melody lulls characters into a drowsy, dreamlike state. All must Save Versus Spell or fall asleep
on the slimy earth, waking the following morning
(unless disturbed).
A sinister chant foretells the dominion of fungus over
humanoid life in Dolmenwood, with the whispered
refrain “The Myconom desires you, westward lies the
font.”
A canticle recounts the deeds of St Jorrael, whereby
the saint’s holy words emboldened oppressed villagers to rise up against a despot baron and bring him
and his knights to justice.

Prayer: If a suitable icon is placed on the altar, characters
praying may receive the blessing of St Jorrael: the ability
to cast Rally. See Shrines, p22.

Buried Reliquary (Map Required)
Near the middle of the hex, there stands a gigantic oak tree.
A plain black chest containing three relics of St Jorrael is
buried among its roots, 5′ beneath the earth. The tree and
the buried reliquary can only be found by characters who
know of its precise location, for example via the map lost
in the hoard of the great wyrm Chasobrithe (see hex 1107).
The Cap of St Jorrael: This plain black cap cloaks its wearer
in anonymity; anyone trying to recall their face when not
in their presence is unable to. Worth 8,000gp.
The Skull of St Jorrael: If its eyes are pointed at an object,
it whispers the object’s value in a hoarse, sepulchral voice.
Worth 2,000gp.
The Shoe of St Jorrael: Ensures a light tread. The wearer
never activates the pressure plates of traps and cannot be
tripped up by slippery surfaces, such as rain-slicked rooftiles, mossy rocks, ice, or similar obstacles. Worth 9,000gp.

375

1706

Mosslings and the Yellow Monolith

Sodden ground, impenetrable bramble thickets. Winding paths with little wooden bridges and walkways.
Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Mulchgrove
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with squirrels and raccoons attempting to pilfer
small items from passersby (25% chance of success).
These animals are in the service of the mosslings that
dwell in this hex, who have trained them in thievery.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d6 portions of
Speckled Sporange (p428), in addition to the normal
results.

Mossling Burrows
A few dozen mossling (DMB) families make their homes
in this region at the edge of Mulchgrove, living in burrows
beneath the boles of ancient, moss-bearded trees.
Limbly the Master of Locks: One especially labyrinthine
burrow is home to Limbly, regarded as the most cunning of
the mosslings and famed as the “Master of Locks.” Limbly
dwells amid the crowded clutter of his key-cutting workshops with his wife Griselda and their sixteen children
and grandchildren.
Klimbim the Claywife: In a root-tangled burrow of sandy
chambers dwells Klimbim, renowned for her remarkable
ability to identify the ingredients of potions and brews.
She is known as the Claywife, on account of her eleven
“husbands”—slimy, semi-humanoid mounds that she has
fashioned to do her bidding (treat as manikins, DMB).

The Yellow Vorpal Monolith
In the west of this hex, a 20′-high spectral monolith of
golden light hovers in a grove of moss-smothered oaks.
This is one of the mysterious vorpal monoliths that trace
an emergent fifth ley line in Dolmenwood (see Vorpal
Monoliths, p19). In winter, spring, and summer, the
monolith is a mere shimmering figment. In the autumn,
it becomes semi-corporeal.
Viewing: All who behold the monolith in the autumn must
Save Versus Spell. Arcane spell-casters gain a +2 bonus.
Those who fail are transmuted into a dragonfly for 24
hours.
Touching: In its autumn manifestation, the monolith’s
partially tangible surface feels like tepid gel. Any charm
spell cast while touching the monolith forms a permanent
binding. There is a 2-in-6 chance of each creature charmed
in this manner joining into telepathic contact with all
others enchanted in this way and turning against those
who enchanted them. In other seasons, a PC touching the
monolith’s diaphanous outline temporarily experiences
the crisp coolness of an autumn morn.

Limbly the Master of Locks
A wizened old mossling man aged over three centuries. His eyes are now blind, furred over with orange
fungus. His beard of moss, home to centipedes and
mice, reaches down to his toes, and his ears are grown
larger than his hands.
Demeanour (Lawful): Kindly, absent-minded. Periodically falls asleep mid-conversation.
Speech: Whistling rasp. Woldish, Mulch.
Desires: For his middle-aged daughter to marry a
magician. To drink once more in the Sombre Lamb in
Orbswallow (p173), as he did in his youth.
Knowledge: Limbly is a master lock singer. His charms
can coax any lock in Dolmenwood to open.

Klimbim the Claywife
A hearty, rotund mossling woman in the lazy ease of her
middle age. Her hair is a jumble of matted, brown fibre,
her toes (she wears no shoes) are like shiny conkers, and
her lips are festooned with purple bracket fungi.
Demeanour (Neutral): Wide-eyed, curious, fidgety.
Speech: Jumps between topics, unabashedly intimate.
Woldish, Mulch.
Desires: To learn the secret of granting sentience to
her clay husbands. To locate her friend, the witch Joab,
whose hut in 1606 was razed. Covets gems.
Knowledge: Klimbim can identify the ingredients in
any herbal admixture or potion by means of a deep
olfactory analysis taking 2d12 hours.

376

The Fugitive Witch

1707

Serene, profusely fern-filled glades. Ancient oak copses draped with spongy, hanging lichen.
Terrain: Open forest (2), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with 2d6 giant ants (DMB) from the nest at The
Shrine to St Benester.
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Frondhelm (p430), in addition to the normal results.

The Rainbow Pool
A small lake, encircled with susurrant reed-beds and wide
beaches of inky clay. The waters glitter with darting rainbows and teem with leaping fish and quacking birds.
Examining the clay: Barefoot human prints can be found,
leading to the Chestnut Dell.
Peering into the water: The black clay extends to the
lakebed, where it is streaked with swathes of crimson,
ochre, azure, and fuchsia.
Drinking: The water is magically nourishing. Drinking a
pint has the same effect as eating a day’s rations.

The Chestnut Dell
A verdant dell in the vicinity of the Rainbow Pool, its slopes
clad with chestnut trees. Hunks of crumbled, mossy stone
protrude from the sea of ferns filling the hollow.
Examining the stones: They appear to be the remnants of
a chapel, long collapsed and overgrown. The beneficent,
leafy visage of the Wood God Cwrnus (p36) is graven
into several larger chunks.
Inhabitant: The witch Joab Elfwit—an Eye of Limwdd
(DMB)—is melded into the earth, able to observe goings
on here. After travellers have departed, she may emerge
from hiding and call out to them, pretending to be lost, a
victim of fairy magic. She may request aid in “returning” to
Prigwort (whence she intends to travel alone to the Locus
of Limwdd in 1006), promising a reward.
Escorting Joab: She refuses to pass through Castle Brackenwold, claiming her vengeful sisters live there. Should the
group visit an inn or settlement on the journey, there is a
daily 2-in-6 chance thereafter that the party is ambushed
by 7 clerics of St Faxis (Level 1 clerics—DMB) seeking Joab’s
capture. At the journey’s end, Joab rewards the party as
agreed and disappears at the first opportunity.

The Shrine to St Benester (Hidden)

Joab Elfwit—Witch (Eye of Limwdd)
A tall, willow-slender human woman of age 50, with
dense black ringlets, chestnut eyes, and a crooked nose.
Bedraggled and mud-streaked, having been melded
into the earth (see Witch, Eye of Limwdd powers—
DMB) for months. Formerly dwelt in 1606, where she
used the whispers of the magic caves to blackmail Sanctus Primus (p71). Fled here when her hut was razed
by clerics of St Faxis. Alienated from her coven and
fearful for her life.
Demeanour (Neutral): Disoriented and drowsy from
having been melded into the earth for so long. Wary,
tricksome.
Speech: Slurred, well-to-do. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: Communion with Limwdd in 1006. Her coven’s
forgiveness for bringing them into peril through her
blackmailing of Sanctus Primus.
Possessions: 10pp, 50gp, 25sp. Vials of Sandor’s Phantasmal Elixir (p414) and Wyrmsblood Elixir (p414). A
coral pendant carved in the shape of a unicorn (250gp).
Reward: May give any of her possessions to those who
aid her, but tries to minimise the reward.

A marble shrine, formed like an elegant mausoleum, now
buried in a 20-yard-diameter mound of branches, only the
base of one of the entrance pillars visible. The mound is the
nest of 50 giant ants (DMB), who swarm around the area
hunting living creatures and gathering wood.
Shrine room: Squirming giant ant eggs glued to a marble
diorama of St Benester and seventeen archangels. Semi-humanoid sculptures formed of bones, armour, and equipment of the ants’ victims, including 2,000gp.
Prayer: If the shrine is cleared of the anthill, characters
praying may receive the blessing of St Benester: the ability
to cast Mantle of Protection. See Shrines, p22.

The Lost Mine
Overgrown piles of stone dot the woods, ruined remnants of ancient settlement.

Terrain: Hilly forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Blighted Hillside
The path of the Downs Road passes by a half-mile square
expanse of sloping hillside forested only by ancient
tree stumps and twisted dwarf trees. The place seems
forsaken—no bird can be heard and no beast spotted.
Acrid, coppery stench: A metallic odour permeates the
air, irritating the throat and leaving a coppery aftertaste.
Mud and coloured pools: Much of the hillside is mud.
Pools of water, orange-brown or oxidised green, sit stagnant amongst the tree stumps.
Toxic hazards: The mud and pools are infused with a
stew of lead, mercury, sulphur, and arsenic, leached from
the discarded tailings of the copper mine destroyed here
nearly two millennia ago. Drinking it is lethal.
Exploring: PCs exploring the hillside must Save Versus
Doom or suffer 1d4 damage (chemical burns around feet).
Smelting pit: A shallow pit, filled with ancient, toxic-smelling ash and rock, sits at the base of the hill. Characters
with a knowledge of mining or alchemy (e.g. some arcane
spell-casters) recognise it as a primitive site for extraction
of copper from ore.
Mine entrances: There are four mine entrances at various
levels of the hillside. All but one are blocked with rubble.

Orsath
A massive, burly, ursine creature, 14′ tall, its fur an
alloyed carpet of delicate, glittering copper-infused
needles. Its face is all animalistic hatred and agony,
its mind completely gone in a fog of arsenic-induced
dementia. For more details about this former Wood
God, see Orsath, p39.
Large Monstrosity—Animal Int.—Chaotic

Level 15 AC 17 HP 71 Saves D3 R4 H5 B6 S7

or 3 wall spikes (+10, 1d8, range 20′/40′/60′) Speed 40
Morale 10 XP 3,900
Immunities: Only harmed by magic or magic weapons.
Wall spikes: Orsath’s essence infuses the chamber’s
wall and ceiling protuberances through a ghastly
alchemical synergy. Instead of attacking with its claws
and bite, it can cause 3 of these spikes to detach and
hurtle towards the PCs.
Arsenic haze: Save Versus Doom or suffer a –2 penalty
to Attack Rolls for 1d6 Rounds.
Treasure: If Orsath is slain, its claws continue to glow.
They can be crafted into two weapons (1d8 + arsenic
haze). The Drune or other high-Level arcane spell-casters would pay up to 7,000gp for the Wood God’s
remains, depending on condition, and 1,000gp for each
spike (eight are salvageable).

378

Into the Mine
The single unblocked mine entrance leads down a tunnel
reinforced with wooden beams.
Broken human bones: Shards of bone litter the path, often
snapped cleanly with apparently great force.
Mineshaft: After passing several collapsed side tunnels,
the passage ends at a downward vertical shaft. An orange
glow emanates from its depths. Descent to the base, 90′
down, requires climbing or ropes.

The Bottom Chamber
At the bottom of the shaft, explorers emerge into a high,
vaulted chamber, crudely hewn from the earth.
Pulsating walls: The chamber walls are shot through with
veins of pure copper, pulsing with bright liquid amber
light as if alive.
Tools and bones: Discarded primitive mining tools and
broken bones carpet the floor.
Orsath: Looming at the end of the chamber is a hulking,
bear-like being with metallic fur: the Wood God once called
Orsath. Its arms stretch horizontally to either side of it,
fully encrusted in bright blue crystals of copper sulphate,
with massive glowing claws pressed flat onto the wall
behind it. The creature immediately notices the party; it
straightens its arms, shakes off the crystals, and lets out
a pain-filled roar as it seeks to annihilate the intruders.
Awful protuberances: Sharp conical things protrude from
the ceiling and walls, akin to stalactites, yet blighted with a
patchwork of Orsath’s dark brown fur and honey-coloured,
crystallised ichor. A terrible fusion of stone and flesh, they
glow in unison with the copper veins.

Chateau Mauvesse and the Dark Mirror 1802
Dreary, teal-leafed willow trees, their great, sweeping boughs drifting in a gentle breeze.
Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.

Chateau Mauvesse
The trail from Meagre’s Reach wends its way through
marshes, climbs a rocky incline, and ultimately leads to
a sprawling, antiquated, manorial estate of many tiers,
overlooking the Dark Mirror. This is the home of Ygraine
Mordlin (p84).
Wall and gates: A great brick wall, overgrown with ivy,
surrounds the chateau’s grounds. The iron gates, wrought
in serpentine forms, magically swing open, allowing
entrance to any who dare.
Fungal gardens: The manor’s gardens have fallen out of
use and have become overgrown with brilliant, phosphorescent bracket mushrooms.
The chateau: The chateau’s violet masonry shimmers as
though always cast in the light of an unobscured sunset,
falling into darkness only when the moon is high.
The front door: Polished, greenish wood with a brass,
imp-faced doorknob. The doorknob speaks, bidding visitors welcome as the door swings open.

Inside the Chateau
The interior is lavish­—fine carpets over marble and granite
flags—but the atmosphere is subdued. Courtly music and
sounds of merrymaking echo through the halls, though
their source is hard to locate.
Inhabitants: Fairy courtiers and emissaries, visiting
Ygraine. A small number of servants (possibly of fairy
origin) tend to guests’ needs. Rugs and furnishings seem
to move and clean themselves.
The Lady Ygraine: Is invariably indisposed, playing host
to a continuous and fatiguing array of eminent fairies. She
may make time to consult on matters occult.
The great hall: Many frescos of foreign lands line the walls,
depicting images of deserts, jungles, and strange arctic
skies. At the end of the great hall sits a dais and a throne
upon it, where the Lady Ygraine holds her court.
The dining hall: Adjacent to the main hall is a grand dining
hall with a large round table of fairy make. At the table
sit twenty chairs of faintly glimmering fairy wood, each
carved with the likeness of an important fairy personage
(including each of the nobles described under Fairy Nobles
and Their Dominions, p30).
The nodal crypt: In a secret crypt amid the chateau’s foundations stands the obsidian obelisk called Phandrwyl—the
hidden fifth nodal of the ley line Ywyr. The crypt is warded
by such dread magic that even the Drune cannot perceive
the stone’s existence. Ygraine draws much of her power
hence.

Guest rooms, libraries, cloisters: Half a dozen floors filled
with guest rooms and amenities for those staying in the
chateau, a few private libraries, and a small set of cloisters
for deities of multiple religions.
Studios: An art studio of half-finished portraits and a small
museum dedicated to the pottery of ancient breggles.
Postern gate: Manned by speaking owls, leading to a sharp
drop over the Dark Mirror.
The chambers of Ygraine: Above this all, and accessible to
few, is the spiral staircase that leads into the highest tower
of the chateau. Overlooking the Dark Mirror, the Sorceress
Ygraine dwells within.

The Dark Mirror
Below Chateau Mauvesse runs the Dark Mirror. The lake’s
blackened waters are illuminated by the glamour of starlight, and perpetually reveal a reflection of a benighted sky,
even in the day. The lake is part of the mortal dominion of
the Duke Who Cherishes Dreams, a fairy noble and sometime ally of Ygraine.

The Dark Mirror At Night
There is a 3-in-6 chance that several of the Duke’s pale,
swan-like ships slowly take form on the lake.
Dredging of dreams: The ships’ fairy sailors dredge the
lake, collecting the dreams of the mortal folk of Dolmenwood that pool here, for inclusion in the Duke’s libraries.
Passengers and cargo: While once the ships ferried the
Duke’s courtiers, tribute, and gifts of friendship to the
chateau, and at times even the Duke himself, they now
carry only spies and diplomats, due to the current unease
between the Duke and Ygraine (p85).
Entry to Fairy: Those boarding the ships are, at the Referee’s option, transported to Hypnagogia, the Fairy domain
of the Duke Who Cherishes Dreams.

The Lonely Tree

A low fog rises from the sodden earth. Trees ooze silvery sap and fungi thrive on rotting trunks.
Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6. Encounters with humanoids
are 3-in-6 likely to be with delirious, elderly individuals
fleeing the area.
Foraging: The chance of foraging is increased by 1-in-6
in this hex. Successful foraging yields 2d6 fresh rations
of edible fungi.

Forsaken Forest
The abundance of edible mushrooms and sap-rich trees
should attract civilization or its enterprises, yet these
woods remain scarcely trod.
Abandoned campsites: Many abandoned camps can be
found on the edges of deer trails, some recent, some old.
Carrion birds in trees: A careful eye might notice, in the
upper boughs of the forest, many a bloated carrion crow
and magpie waiting with a hungry glint in its eyes.

The Lonely Tree
In the northern fringe of the hex is a hill ringed with bristle
thickets and bogs. Atop it, a mighty apple tree stands as
tall as a tower, adorned with dozens of gnarled, rosy fruits.
Wayward thralls: There is a 3-in-6 chance that 1d8 dishevelled wanderers—wood tramps, vagabonds, lepers, and
wayward pilgrims—are gathered at this hill, reciting
strange legends and consuming bitter crab apples from
the tree in an odd state of torpor. They refer to the tree as
the “Lonely Tree” and feel the need to stay in its presence
to keep it company.
Eating the apples: Those who consume the apples must
Save Versus Spell or fall under an enchantment compelling them to remain in the tree’s presence overnight, relaxing, telling tall tales heard in childhood, and consuming
more apples. Once per subsequent day, they can attempt
to escape the enchantment with a save, continuing in this
state until they succeed or perish (see below).

380

Effects of remaining: An individual loses 1d6 Constitution
and ages 3d6 years for each week they spend in the tree’s
thrall. Those who die near the tree are dragged beneath the
soil by its roots. Those who die further away are devoured
by carrion birds.
Nature of the tree: The Lonely Tree itself is an intelligent
entity, though it is unable to attack or directly influence
anyone who does not consume its fruits. Not outrightly
malevolent, it is an intelligence consumed by ennui and a
desire for company. Unbeknownst to all (including itself),
the tree was created 150 years ago by the sorceress Ygraine
Mordlin (p84), as an early experiment with the temporal magicks she would eventually use to wrest nearby
Meagre’s Reach (hex 1703) from the past.

Mumblebole Manor

1804

Uneven woodland, pocked with gullies and pools. The reek of ripe cheese wafts throughout.
Terrain: Boggy forest (4), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 3-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d3 portions of
Foolscap (p428), in addition to the normal results.

Cheese Fungus
In a small region in the west of this hex, ochre fungal
tendrils creep across the ground and drape among the
tree branches, oozing cream. Dotted among the tendrils
are fruiting bodies that look and smell exactly like hunks
of cheese.
Eating: The fungal cheeses are deliciously ripe and exist in
sufficient quantity for PCs to gorge themselves. (Though
this brings on excessive flatulence.)
Harvesting: Once plucked from the fungal vine, the cheese
hunks dissolve into mould in twelve hours.
Following the tendrils: Leads to Mumblebole Manor.

Mumblebole Manor
At the centre of the region of cheese fungus is the base of
the mossling adventurer Blumber: a squat manor formed
of spongy fungal matter, its oval windows veiled with
curtains of mould. Floating above is a giant puffball as
large as the manor, tethered to the roof by mycelial cords.
Cheese gardens: The manor’s grounds are occupied by row
after row of neatly tended cheese fungus.
Interior: Warm, pulsing, fleshy walls, 5′ high ceilings.
Carpeted with soft moss and cluttered with rough wooden
furnishings, clad with bark. Most rooms are dedicated to
feasting, cooking, or sleeping.
Library: A circular chamber at the heart of the manor
houses a rare collection of books written in Mulch and a
gallery of maps of the moon’s surface.
Secret vault: A trapdoor in the library, concealed by moss,
leads to a poky cellar lined with puffball skin. In locked
iron chests are 5,000gp, 20,000sp, 2 Cream Horns, 3 Ashy
Bishops, and 5 Lichen Yargs (see Magical Cheeses).
Inhabitants: Blumber, the mossling cheese-breeder, and
her 10 mossling (DMB) assistants, tending the fungal
gardens, staffing the bustling kitchens, and parading
around playing sea shanties on toadstool cap tubas.
Visitors: Those of a cheerful nature may be invited for a
slap-up feast of cheese and mushrooms. Guests may be
offered Magical Cheeses for sale and hear of Blumber’s
plans to inflate her giant puffball sufficiently to lift her
entire manor into the air, bound for the cheese fields of
the moon (see Blumber’s Desires).

Blumber (Level 8 Fighter)
A stocky mossling woman, near spherical in girth,
with a mound of yellow mould in place of hair, bracket
fungus ears, and spotted toadstool caps in place of eyes.
Dresses in leather straps and patches of fur.
Demeanour (Neutral): Chatty, harebrained. Loves
cheese above all else.
Speech: Rumbling drawl. Woldish, Mulch.
Desires: The body of a yellow bile wyrm, to be boiled
down to produce a potent gas to lift the puffball balloon
into the air. To visit the cheese fields of the moon.
Trusty adventurers to join her on this fantastic voyage.
Possessions: A crusty old diary describing the journey
of a group of rat-folk who descended to Dolmenwood
from the moon. A thorny Arcane Club (p412). An iron
Amulet of Density (p398) graven with a leering griffon’s face.
Fungal symbiosis: Can release a 10′ cube cloud of mould
spores, suffering 1d6 damage in the process. All within
must Save Vs. Blast or die of choking within 6 Rounds.

Magical Cheeses
Blumber has bred several unique species of magical
fungal cheeses that duplicate the effects of potions or
balms. She may be willing to sell some of the specimens
she keeps in her vault.
Cream Horn: Oozing horns of blue cheese. Acts as
Dimensional Solvent, Gold (p402). 3,000gp.
Ashy Bishop: Ash-coated rounds of pungent, purple
brie. Acts as Distillation of Hoarfrost (p414). 2,000gp.
Lichen Yarg: Creamy white soft cheese wrapped in pickled lichen. Acts as Prismatic Elixir (p414). 1,000gp.

1805

The Willow Mouth
An airy wood of little brooks and bendy, old willow trees.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

The Willow’s Pool
Following the lay of the land and the gentle flow of the
water leads down to a wide pool covered in algae and lily
pads, surrounded by willows. Animals of the wood seem
to shun this pool.
Willow and mouth: At one end of the pool stands an enormous willow tree, unusually thick, with a gigantic (10′ tall)
human mouth in the base of its trunk: the Great Willow.
Inside the gullet: Characters who feed the willow a large
animal (see Willow’s Desires) notice that its throat leads
to a cavernous area beneath the tree: the Willow’s Gullet.
Three white cows, standing still, undigested and fully
intact, can be glimpsed in the gullet. If questioned about
them, the Willow replies: “My first meal. Didn’t go down
so well. Still bothers me.”

The Willow’s Gullet / Shrine to St Gripe
(Hidden)
A humid, foetid chamber. Tree roots pulse in the walls like
veins. The walls and floor ripple unnervingly.
Statuary: Visitors discover that the undigested cows are
in fact statues of cows, standing on a thick wooden platform. Amongst them is a fourth statue (not visible from
the surface): St Gripe the forthright, depicted as a young
man leading the cows, his expression wary and watchful.
Prayer: With heavy labour and some cajoling of the Great
Willow to open its mouth wide, adventurers can remove
the statues and platform, soothing the Willow and restoring the shrine. After that, characters praying may receive
the blessing of St Gripe: the ability to cast Find Traps. See
Shrines, p22.

The Great Willow
A miraculous, magical creation of the Dolmenwood:
a huge willow tree with a human mouth. The mouth
emits loud moans, as if hungry.
Demeanour (Neutral): Ravenously hungry and eager
to negotiate for food.
Speech: Loud, deep, indignant. Woldish, Sylvan.
Desires: The Great Willow is voraciously carnivorous,
but has no way of getting food into its gullet. Due to
its size, only whole sheep, deer, cattle, horses, etc. can
provide the willow with a satisfying meal. The Willow
also seeks relief from the indigestion caused by the
white cows (see The Willow’s Gullet) and allows characters to safely enter its mouth if they offer aid.
Rewards: In exchange for food or relief from the
dyspepsia-inducing nuisance of the white cows, the
willow mouth can offer knowledge. It knows a great
deal about surrounding hexes, and may be able to
answer obscure questions posed by adventurers.

382

Unearthed Skeleton

1806

Moss-carpeted woodland. Vague scent of carrion when the wind changes.
Terrain: Open forest (2), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

The Skeleton
Sprawled across the centre of the hex is the buried skeleton of a 300′-tall, humanoid giant. Some of its bones still
protrude from the earth, visible amongst the trees: the
fingertips of a hand (each 5′ long) and several ribs (curving
up to 20′ into the air).

Peligrue’s Camp
In a clearing near the hex’s centre is a simple campsite of
tents and wagons.
Inhabitants: Tithelands mage Peligrue the Perspicuous, her guards Grent and Grottle Koop, and 7 labourers
directed by Senna Blore. The group has been excavating
the giant skeleton for six weeks now and, with little to show
for it, the atmosphere has grown increasingly tense. Sore
points include missing pay and the lack of “hidden treasures” Peligrue accidentally promised they’d find.
Approaching: Peligrue eagerly invites visitors to stay the
night, questioning them about their travels until inevitably getting distracted and retiring.
Peligrue’s tent: A mess of maps, planning notes, and
alchemical testing equipment. Numerous books on the
history of Dolmenwood, all by humans.
That evening: Senna confronts Peligrue, who lets slip she
is about to run out of funds. When Senna attempts to take
what she can to compensate the workers, Grent and Grottle
intervene to take all the money for themselves. If the PCs
are present, the Koops try to bribe them to their side, while
Senna appeals to their better nature.

Dig Site
A pit has been dug near the camp, 40′ in diameter and 15′
deep, exposing part of the giant’s head. The skull is on its
side facing west, with a large hole in the temple.
Inside the skull: A 12′ drop through the hole leads to the
dirt floor of the skull’s partially excavated, cavernous interior. A dim emerald glow radiates from a large boulder with
luminous green veins that sits below the hole.
Boulder: Too heavy for the labourers to move, only Peligrue knows its true power. Once per day, someone touching the stone can freely cast a memorised spell twice.
History: Peligrue believes the skeleton belongs to a Wood
God. In truth, it is an ancient giant (see p363), killed when
the enchanted boulder was catapulted through its skull.

Senna Blore—Chief Labourer (Level 1 Fighter)
A well-built human woman in her early 50s, grey
streaks in her short black hair. Her calloused hands
are always holding a tool or object.
Demeanour (Lawful): Kind but serious-minded. Absolute loyalty to those she considers under her care.
Speech: Gruff, considered. Woldish.
Desires: What’s best for “her” labourers. To provide for
her family back in Castle Brackenwold.

Grent & Grottle Koop (Level 2 Fighters)
Stout, red-headed human women (twins) with flushed
complexions. They dress in well-worn chainmail.
Demeanour (Chaotic): Patience that borders on laziness, making their occasional turns towards brutish
violence sudden and unpredictable.
Speech: Rough, straightforward. Woldish.
Desires: To live well. To be accepted back into the Brackenwold soldiery.

Peligrue the Perspicuous (Level 5 Magician)
A wiry human woman in her late thirties, with curly,
prematurely grey hair. Wears deep blue robes with a
golden fringe, dirt and mud splattering the hem.
Demeanour (Neutral): Optimistic, absent-minded, and
easily distracted. Singularly focuses on whatever interests her at any given moment.
Speech: Rapid. Often changes the subject multiple
times a sentence, belying her self-assigned title. Woldish, Old Woldish.
Desires: To use her newly acquired inheritance to prove
her worth and be remembered for a great discovery.
She’s convinced the labourers will understand the
importance of her mission and continue to work when
she eventually runs out of money.
Possessions: The remains of her inheritance (132gp).
An emerald Ring of Protection (p410). Spell books:
Rank 1 Decipher, Ioun Shard, Rank 2 Arcane Cypher, Mind
Crystal, Rank 3 Crystal Vision.

1901

The Chalk Giant

Flocks of crows caw and wheel above rugged chalk downs. Beds of gorse and twisted blue thistle.
Terrain: Hills (2), Table Downs
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6. Encounters are 2-in-6 likely
to be with a peryton.

The Chalk Giant
A humanoid figure, 200′ high, framed by a doorway, occupies the side of a hill, carved into the chalk beneath the turf
of the downs. It is visible for miles around.
The lost scholar: Crouched atop the hill is the Lost Scholar.
He may spot PCs and wave to them excitedly.
Secret door: If the giant’s name—Talorch—is called, he
magically animates and opens the doorway behind him,
revealing a shimmering portal to the Crystal Cave.

The Perytons’ Nest
In the south-western reaches of the hex stands a 100′ sheer
bluff. Atop sits a massive nest of brambles and boughs.
Inhabitants: 5 perytons (DMB).
Treasure: A gold necklace (1,500gp), 3 emeralds (1,000gp
each), and a sack of 2,000sp. Three dead bramblings
(DMB) are incorporated into the materials of the nest. One
clutches a scroll sealed in a tube.
Reading the scroll: Descriptions of a crystalline dreamworld of eternal life, in Drunic, as well as several drawings
of the Chalk Giant, who is referred to as “Talorch.”

The Crystal Cave
Through the door in the Chalk Giant is a vast cave, its walls
entirely encrusted in large purple and mauve crystals. An
old man with the same face as the Lost Scholar appears
in the reflection of the crystals, dressed in black hooded
robes. He introduces himself as Alhair, a Drune.
Asking about his situation: Trapped here by an experiment involving the crystals’ legendary powers of eternal
life. (Which, it turns out, forever entrap the soul.)
Asking about the scroll: Alhair’s bramblings were tasked
to bring it to the Drune Lodge (hex 0507), but were waylaid
by the perytons. His missive to the Aegis was lost.
Asking about the Lost Scholar: Alhair says the man was
no doubt a projection of his own psyche, reacting to the
local environment. “Either that, or I am a projection of his.”

The Lost Scholar—Dream Projection
An old, bearded human man, hunched and weary. He
wears a tattered purple and mauve hooded robe. Claims
to be the last survivor of a group of scholars from the
land of Wyggrabole (a place not known to the PCs), who
had come to study the Chalk Giant. All but he were
eaten by a flock of perytons.
Demeanour (Neutral): Confused and distraught,
cannot even remember his own name.
Speech: Old-fashioned, creaky. Woldish, Drunic.
Desires: Begs PCs to retrieve from the Perytons’ Nest
his notes detailing his “extraordinary findings” and to
help him find his way back to Wyggrabole.
Knowledge: Directions to the nest. Little about the
giant itself.
True nature: The man is a dream projection of Alhair,
the Drune trapped in the Crystal Cave. If PCs return to
the spot where they met him, he has vanished.

Alhair—Ancient Drune
An ancient Drune who was alive at the creation of the
Ring of Chell (p20).
Demeanour (Neutral): Cheerful, content, eccentric.
Eager to speak.
Speech: Calm, warm whisper, punctuated with cheerful
laughter uncharacteristic of Drune. Woldish, Drunic,
Old Drunic.
Desires: Company and conversation. He does not wish
to be freed, and is happy here in his crystal dream world.
Knowledge: He knows much of the Cold Prince (p51),
the Ring of Chell, and the ley lines of Dolmenwood
(p18), and shares this knowledge freely.

384

The Clockwork Man

1902

Wild woods that seem inexplicably well-tended. Rows of wildflowers beside paths. Little bridges span brooks.
Terrain: Hilly forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Ley line Ywyr (p18): Arcane spell-casters perceive
the distant moaning of the dead.

The Clockmaker’s House
Nestled between three hills is a two-storey house of grey,
gloomy stone. Ivy climbs up its damp walls and patches of
shaggy moss hang down from the bowing roof. It appears
abandoned; the windows are shattered and the front door
very slightly ajar.
Approaching: A cacophony of ticking comes from inside
the house.
Living room: This spacious room is being slowly claimed
by patches of moss and weeds sprouting up from the floor.
The room has been ransacked. Cabinets are thrust open,
drawers pulled out and emptied. The walls are covered with
silly but well-made clocks, still ticking away, including
the Backwards Clock and the Merriman Clock (see Unique
Clocks). The Merriman Clock chimes suddenly, shortly after
PCs enter.
Staircase: Leads up to the bedroom. Three sheets of parchment are strewn upon the stairs; each is a note to a Mr
Klepp (p127) in Blackeswell, unfinished past the salutation and some pleasantries.
Bedroom: Simple furnishings, also destroyed. A skeleton is in the bed, lying in a putrid black stain. Wadded up
old clothes are piled on the floor in front of an emptied
armoire. The Crooked Clock and Mood Clock hang here
(see Unique Clocks); if the arm on the Mood Clock is set
to “Awestruck,” a secret door in the back of the armoire
swings open, leading to the Workroom.

Unique Clocks

Workroom
Cobweb-festooned shelves packed with springs, gears,
and metal sheets. Tarps cover unfinished and incomprehensible contraptions. A workbench is crowded with the
schematics for ridiculous clockwork war machines. The
Clockwork Man stands in the corner, dusty and inert.
Examining the man: A plaque on the back of his neck
reads “Clockwork Mechanical Soldier.” A large metal key
protrudes from the centre of his back.
Winding the key: Sets his works ticking, and his eyes flick
open. He struggles with his creaking joints, which must be
oiled before he can move properly. Once fully functional,
he introduces himself with a groggy “good morning.”

Of the clocks on the walls, four in particular stand out
for their workmanship and odd qualities.

The Clockwork Man

Crooked Clock: A simple, elegant silver clock whose
arms continually twist themselves into angular,
crooked shapes. (Worth 300gp).

A humanoid automaton made entirely of brass with a
rotund torso like a metal barrel. He has no mouth, but
his metal moustaches waggle as he speaks.

Backwards Clock: Lacquered wood with a stately,
enamelled face. It runs backwards, and staring at it for
more than a minute induces nausea. (Worth 150gp).

Demeanour (Neutral): Childlike curiosity. Loyal.

Mood Clock: Diamond-shaped and fashioned from lead,
this piece has a face with only four labels: “Euphoric,”
“Awestruck,” “Ticked Off (Pun Intended),” and “Terrified.” Moving the arm to point at a label causes the clock
to speak, with tone and varying phrases matching the
described mood. (Worth 500gp).

Desires: To learn more about the world, and to become
more like a real human. He may choose to accompany
the PCs for a time.

Merriman Clock: Exquisitely detailed wooden piece in
the form of a fantastically elaborate cottage. Every hour
and half-hour, a tiny wooden merriman (see Animals,
DMB) emerges from the attic door, and lies down slowly
as if to sleep, all the while singing a haunting, soporific
melody. (Worth 750gp).

Speech: Tinny, as if echoing on the inside of his head.
Mannerly and methodical. Woldish.

Knowledge: Does not know what happened to his
master. The last thing he remembers is being told to
wait here, which he did until his clockworks ran down.
Medium Construct—Sentient—Neutral

Level 3 AC 16 HP 20 Saves D11 R12 H13 B14 S15
Att Weapon (+2) Speed 30 Morale 10 XP 40
Construct: Immune to biological effects (e.g. disease,
poison).

1903

Merry Lodgings
A profusion of ditches and gullies, their dank bottoms filled with iridescent water.

Terrain: Hilly forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Bracket Outlook
Close to the centre of this hex, an enormous silver birch
stands at the centre of a wide, sunlit glade. The birch is nigh
on twice the height of the surrounding woods, standing a
clear 60′ proud of the canopy.
Bracket ledges: All the way up the birch’s smooth trunk are
giant, woody bracket fungi, large enough to act as seats for
human-sized individuals. Climbing up the brackets, the
tree’s high branches can be easily attained.
Outlook: From the top of the birch, characters can survey
the surrounding hexes and make out details: the edges of
Dolmenwood and the desolate Table Downs beyond to the
north and north-east, Chateau Mauvesse perched on cliffs
above the Dark Mirror (hex 1802) to the north-west, the top
of a white marble tower (hex 1904) to the south, and open
land reaching to the horizon to the east.

Woodland Cottage
A quaint little cottage stands at the base of a steep-sided
valley carpeted with foxgloves. Wood is piled neatly under
the eaves, smoke rises merrily from the stacked-slate
chimney, and a boiling kettle whistles cheerily.
Entrance: The door (lacquered cherry wood, painted with
dainty flowers) hangs ajar.
Investigating: Calls of greeting go unanswered. Peeking
through windows reveals that, despite appearances, no
one seems to be at home.

Inside the Cottage
A cosy living room lined with bookshelves, a well-stocked
kitchen and pantry, and two bedrooms—all decorated in
a simple, rustic style, lovingly maintained and spotlessly
clean. The place is utterly still, as if the inhabitants had
just stepped out.
Upon entering: The furnishings and household implements magically animate to serve guests: brooms sweep
away dust, kettles pour tea, chairs pull out to seat visitors,
kitchen implements bake scones and boil soups, pillows
and eiderdowns puff themselves, tongs and pokers stoke
the hearth, etc.
Staying overnight: The cottage gladly hosts guests for
one night, providing nourishment, refreshment, and rest.
Any who linger beyond breakfast the following morn are
physically ejected if they persist (see Defences).
Books: The shelves in the living room hold hundreds of
books, on topics ranging from herbalism and woodcraft to
baking and poetry. Searching reveals a notebook written
in the Witches’ Cant, discussing the history of the three
Mirrors of Embala (p75), including the theft of the onyx
mirror by the arch-Drune known as the Aubrathon. The
notes hypothesise that the mirror still lies in the ebony
tower of the Aubrathon (though no location is posited).
Theft: The cottage has a 3-in-6 chance of noticing the
theft of any object from it; if so, it attacks the thieves (see
Defences) and attempts to retrieve the item. Enchanted
items stolen from the cottage stubbornly refuse to function, unless charmed by some means.
Defences: The household implements can gather into the
forms of 3 manikins (DMB) to attack any threats.
History: A sorceress and her husband once lived here in
happy isolation. The enchanted objects in the house were
so contented that, upon the death of the couple, they could
not bear to cease their domestic functions.

386

Hoglyn’s Spire

1904

Tumbled walls and abandoned coppices. Ruined steadings occasionally peek out from the undergrowth.
Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6

Ruined Keep and Spire
In the eastern reaches of the hex, a turret of white marble
stands intact amid mounds of overgrown rubble. Its upper
floor pierces the canopy of the forest.
Entrance: An open archway at the base of the tower.
Inhabitants: 3 badger Cobbins (DMB) named Vannard,
Ivol, and Segwine. Escapees from the Valley of the Wise
Beasts, they learned magic decades ago as assistants to a
Drune cottager who once lived nearby, and now refer to
themselves as “badger-magi.”
Lower storeys: The first through third storeys are a series
of empty halls, windowless rooms, and stairs. Numerous
sets of tiny tracks are visible on the dirty stone floors, identifiable as badger prints by PCs versed in animal tracking.
Fourth storey: A room containing a massive oak desk
packed with papers, each bearing a rune. The desk is an
illusion concealing the door to the final stairwell. Anyone
viewing the runes must Save Versus Spell or be compelled
to leave the Spire at once, unable to return for 1d3 days.
Spells of true seeing or detection of illusion reveal the
portal.
Fifth storey: A cramped library-loft maze of dusty and
precarious stacks and over-packed bookshelves, with the
three badgers’ beds nestled among them. The badgers
spend much of their time reading from the sizable collection of occult documents and folios abandoned here. Notable in this cache is a hidebound tome containing all spells
known by the badgers (see sidebars).
History: The Spire is all that remains of the keep of Hoglyn,
a vassal of the Kingdom of Brackenwold some 600 years
ago. The keep was destroyed when Hoglyn joined the few
lords who resisted Brackenwold’s amalgamation into a
wider kingdom (see History, p14).

Ivol—Cobbin (Badger) Magician
Wears a monocle and a thick greenish wool sweater
with worn suede elbow patches. Ivol is fascinated by
fey magic and is the group’s self-styled “fairy expert.”
Demeanour (Neutral): Self-important, prone to spouting wild misinformation on matters fey.

Vannard—Cobbin (Badger) Magician

Speech: Quiet, deliberate. Woldish, mangled Sylvan.

Bespectacled and clad in a cardigan with mismatched
buttons. His fur has greyed with age. He is the oldest
of the three and the nominal leader. He is obsessed
with the sorceress Ygraine Mordlin (p84), whom he
compares (unfairly) to his former master, the Nag-Lord
(p45), and fears her influence in the region.

Desires: To meet fairies and demi-fey and interview
them on obscure, nonsensical topics.

Demeanour (Neutral): Shrewd, scholarly, absentminded.
Speech: Precise and nasal. Woldish, basic Drunic.
Desires: Any magical object from Ygraine’s home,
Chateau Mauvesse (hex 1802).
Rewards: Vannard can teach an arcane spell-caster how
to create the runes of redirection protecting the badgers’ lair (see Fourth storey).
Spells: Decipher, Ingratiate, Glyph of Locking, Phantasm.

Spells: Ioun Shard, Vapours of Dream, Perceive the Invisible.

Segwine—Cobbin (Badger) Magician
Dressed in a brightly-striped cotton jumper, wearing empty eyeglass frames. She is the youngest of
the group, and also the most eccentric. Spends many
evenings perched on the Spire’s roof, studying the stars.
Demeanour (Neutral): Cordial, dreamy, conspiratorial.
Speech: Impish whisper. Woldish.
Desires: A working telescope. A star chart.
Spells: Shield of Force, Vapours of Dream, Levitate.

Madame Thornwaife’s Laboratory
Great colonies of three-eyed ravens roost in the trees here.

Terrain: Tangled forest (3), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 2-in-6
Foraging: Successful foraging yields 1d2 portions of
Goatsweed (p430), in addition to the normal results.

The Crystal Shard
A jagged, 10′ tall shard of dark grey crystal stands in a wide
glade carpeted with moss and purple lichen.
Metal attraction: Metal objects brought into the glade are
gently pulled towards the shard by a magical force. The pull
is not strong enough to wrench items from a character’s
hands, but it is clearly perceptible.
Etched sigils: Fine, angular sigils are etched into the five
largest facets on the shard’s surface. Arcane spell-casters
recognise these as the alchemical symbols for earth, water,
air, fire, and ether.
Touching the shard with metal: Metallic objects that come
into contact with the shard are instantly liquefied (as if in
the fires of the forge) and absorbed into the crystal.
Touching gold: Gold absorbed into the crystal (even a
single gold piece) causes the entire shard to levitate 5′ off
the ground, revealing a stone stairway spiralling underground, illuminated by lambent yellow crystals. The stairway leads to Madame Thornwaife’s Laboratory.

Madame Thornwaife’s Laboratory
A subterranean labyrinth of elegantly curving passages,
circular antechambers, and domed halls, with rounded
cobblestone floors and white plaster walls and ceilings
decorated with spiralling mosaics of blue crystal. Marble
statues of capering nymphs are encountered here and
there. Furnishings of wood and felt lend an air of comfort.

Services at Madame Thornwaife’s Laboratory
While reclusive, Madame Thornwaife sells certain products of her craft to wealthy visitors.
Potions: At standard prices. 1d4 Prismatic Elixirs, 3-in-6
chance of a Wyrmsblood Elixir, 3-in-6 chance of a Vanishing Philtre, 2-in-6 chance of a Liquid Time. See Potions,
p414.
Alchemical compounds: 4-in-6 chance of each of the
following compounds being in stock: Alchemical Tonic
(p414), Memory Dust (p426), Orgon’s Scintillating
Philtre (p414), Philtre of Wondrous Vitality (p414).

Inhabitants: Famed alchemist Madame Thornwaife and
her assistants: 6 crystaloids (DMB). The assistants are
formed of milky selenite, pulsating with a rainbow-hued
inner light. They speak with a humming vibration.

Alchemical commissions: Madame Thornwaife may
take on commissions, per the standard rules for hiring
an alchemist (DPB).

Visitors: Those who come seeking Madame Thornwaife’s
alchemical aid or sagacious knowledge of plants and fungi
are welcomed. Others are politely expelled.

Madame Virginia Thornwaife—Alchemist/Sage

Alchemical laboratory: At the heart of the complex, accessible only via a secret door, is Madame Thornwaife’s workspace: a seemingly endless array of glass tubes, distilling
vessels, vats of gel, herb racks, hanging skeletons and skins,
and shelf after shelf of grimoires.
Treasure: The lab is littered with valuable items, including
5,000gp worth of alchemically pure gold and platinum
nuggets, 3 Orbs of Illumination (5″ crystal spheres that emit
light in a 30′ radius when tapped—worth 1,500gp each),
and a complete twelve-volume set of the incredibly rare
alchemical treatise Ascrythe’s Transfigurations, bound in
cockatrice skin (worth 10,000gp).

A spry human woman in her 60s, with huge volumes of
wispy white hair, wide-set eyes of clear blue, and long,
deft fingers stained with chemicals. Dresses in purple
velvet robes set with scintillating gemstones. Once a
lecturer at the Royal Institute of Physicks and Sorcerers
in Castle Brackenwold (p134), Thornwaife now lives
as a recluse, absorbed by her research.
Demeanour (Lawful): Animated, impatient. Filled with
wonder when discussing her craft. Incessantly drums
her fingers.
Speech: Posh. Woldish, Old Woldish, Caprice.
Desires: Magical herbs and fungi. Monster parts. Would
pay 10,000gp for one of the Mirrors of Embala (p75).
Possessions: A mother-of-pearl Talisman of Protection
From Scrying (p398).
Knowledge: Specialises in unusual plants and fungi.
Apply the standard rules for hiring a sage (DPB).

Wetherbrooke’s Last Show

1906

Butterflies flit through spacious glades. In winter, their wings are rimed with hoarfrost.
Terrain: Open forest (2), Aldweald
Lost/encounters: 1-in-6

Abandoned Campsite
A glade near the forest edge contains an encampment of
eight wagons of varying sizes, painted in what were once
bright colours, now dulled by extensive weathering.
Five enclosed wagons: With doors and windows, eclectically adorned with baroque woodwork.
Three cage-wagons: Rusty cages, atop wagon bases. Large
enough to house great beasts. The cages are unlocked and
contain only parched straw.
Lettering: Painted on the sides of the wagons, in large,
highly-stylised red-and-yellow letters, are the words
“Wetherbrooke’s Wild World of Wonders.”
How did they get here?: There is no path between the trees
by which the wagons might have arrived here.

Inside the Enclosed Wagons
The enclosed wagon interiors are ransacked, covered in
cobwebs, and strewn with animal droppings.
Blue wagon with partial second storey: Empty food stores
and office (desk and overturned chair), with a very steep
staircase leading to a bedroom. In the desk is a water-damaged financial ledger. Under the bed is a locked wooden
strongbox, easily forced open, containing 205sp.
Two long orange wagons: Tightly packed bunks line the
walls, some containing small animal nests. The far end of
each wagon is partitioned into a pair of tiny bedrooms,
containing: 1. A rack holding an Arcane Whip (p412, 1d6
damage, reach 10′, +2 enchantment bonus only applies
against great cats); 2. Barbells with hollow wooden weights
painted to look like iron; 3. A half-empty vial of chartreuse
liquid sitting on a makeup table (if consumed, Save Versus
Doom or die within 1d4 Turns); 4. The image of a ghastly,
grinning clown face painted on the wall in lurid tones,
immediately next to a tarnished mirror.
Short black wagon with purple trim: An embroidered
cloth-covered table with a cracked crystal ball and a bed
behind a curtain. Stale smell of incense. Upon entering, a
disembodied female voice shrieks, urging PCs to flee the
encampment immediately. Under the table is a hollow fake
thumb holding a carnelian (50gp).
Large white wagon: Empty crates; dried-out, brittle leather
tent-bundling straps.

Big Top
An adjoining glade is filled by a bright red circus tent in
perfect condition, its flap open invitingly.

Inside the Tent
Wooden benches and bales of hay surround a circus ring.
Spectral performers and animals: Wink into and out of
existence, the humans’ faces all grimaces of unceasing
despair and terror. Acts include (roll 1d6): 1. Two tigers with
tamer; 2. Clowns juggling torches and knives; 3. Acrobats
forming a human pyramid; 4. Elephant performing tricks;
5. Strongman lifting barbells; 6. Fire-eater. The show is
seemingly unending.
An audience of spectral fey creatures: Cheers and claps
appreciatively.
Ringmaster: An apparition of a tall and wiry elf in a top hat
and garish red long-tailed suit soon approaches, demanding both a fee for the performance and an “honest assessment” of the show.
Tribute or trouble: If the characters hand over 20gp per
PC and offer effusive praise, the ringmaster salutes their
“refinement and taste” and allows them to view the performances for as long as they like. Otherwise, his face elongates and widens into a giant, distorted parody of ire. 2
tigers (as dire wolves—DMB) become corporeal and attack,
as the spectators roar with excitement.
Defeating the tigers: Causes the audience to erupt in
booing. They and the circus vanish, and the tent collapses.
Only the ringmaster’s empty suit remains, alongside a sack
containing 320gp and 512 human teeth.
Fleeing: The tigers pursue PCs for up to 10 Rounds, then
vanish.

Music: Emanates from the doorway, both energetic and
wistful.
Magically rooted: The ropes and spikes holding up the tent
are immovable and indestructible.

“

here’s an old adage that the traveller’s greatest
treasure is the friends they made on the journey.
Hogswallop. You know what the greatest treasure
is? Treasure. A nice gem or piece o’ jewellery cut as sharp as a
star. Or better yet, a magical trinket or two. Gotta be careful,
though. While fairy curses are what everyone will warn ye
about, the last thing you wanna be is a hapless git like myself
who slaps on a blessed suit of armour and finds his skin blistering. Come to think of it, if you haven’t got a quality magician,
one you can trust mind you, to look these trinkets over, best
just selling ‘em for coin first chance you get.”
—Snerg Snidebleat, breggle thief

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

Placing Treasure
Guidelines for creating precious hoards to tempt and reward diligent adventurers.

T

here are two methods of deciding what treasure
creatures have in their lairs: rolling randomly
and Referee choice.

Rolling Treasure

Letter codes in a monster’s listing indicate the magnitude
of C(oins), R(iches), and M(agic) typically found in its hoard.
These codes correspond to the rows in the Coins, Riches,
and Magic Items tables opposite.

How to Roll Treasure
The table row for each treasure type lists one or more types
of coins or items. For each entry in the table row:
1. Roll chance: First roll d100, using the listed percentage
chance, to see whether this item is present.
2. Roll number: If a range of values is given (e.g. 1d6 ×
1,000cp, 6d6 gems), roll the specified dice to determine
the quantity of this item that is present.
3. Roll details: For gems, art objects, and magic items,
further rolls determine their value and properties.
▶ Gems and art objects: See p394.
▶ Magic items: If the treasure type indicates a specific
type of magic item (e.g. 3 potions), roll on the table for
that type of item (found in the following pages). Otherwise, first roll on the Magic Item Type table to determine
the type of the item, then roll on the table for that type
(found in the following pages).
Example: The Referee is rolling a hoard for a group of monsters
that have treasure type C5. The C5 row in the Coins table indicates that the hoard may contain copper pieces (45% chance),
silver pieces (40% chance), and gold pieces (30% chance). Starting with copper, the Referee rolls d%: a roll of 30 indicates
that copper coins (1d10 × 1,000) are present in the hoard. The
Referee rolls 1d10, resulting in 7 × 1,000cp. A second d% roll of
78 indicates no silver coins are present. A third d% roll of 24
indicates that gold coins (1d8 × 1,000) are present. The Referee
rolls 1d8, resulting in 2 × 1,000gp. The hoard thus consists of a
total of 7,000cp and 2,000gp. The Referee decides to also roll
on the optional Coin Appearance table. Two d10 rolls indicate
coins stamped with the head of Lady Mulbreck on one side and
a cockatrice on the other.

Manual Adjustments
If the value of the randomly generated treasure is significantly above or below the average value of the treasure
type, the Referee may adjust the results manually, as
desired.

392

Referee Choice

The Referee may choose treasures appropriate to the
monsters and the PC party. As treasure is the main source
of XP (see Awarding XP, p106), carefully consider treasure placement. The following procedure is recommended:
1. Assess XP requirements: Consider the size of the
adventuring party, the Levels of the characters, the XP
they need to advance in Level, and the desired rate of
advancement.
2. Decide XP total: Decide how many Experience Points
the treasure hoard should provide if the party successfully acquires it.
3. Choose treasures: Place treasures whose total value
matches the determined XP total.

Balance of Reward Versus Danger
When using this approach, the Referee should ensure that
the treasure is guarded by sufficiently powerful monsters.
Adventurers should have to earn this reward.

Treasure Maps (Optional)
The Referee may wish to place maps indicating the
location of a valuable treasure hoard (see the Treasure
Hoard table). Treasure maps may not always be easy to
interpret: a map may be incomplete, worded in riddles,
or written in an obscure language.
Chance: When rolling treasure, the Referee may replace
1-in-10 rolled magic items with a treasure map.

Random determination of treasure (see p392) sometimes results in large numbers of gems or art objects.
In such cases, it is sometimes preferable to simplify
things, rather than determining the specifics of dozens
of items.
Combining items: The values of multiple items may be
combined into a single more precious item. For example, ten 500gp gems could be combined into a single,
exquisite jewel worth 5,000gp.
Average values: For very large numbers of items, rather
than rolling for the value of each item, the Referee may
assign the approximate average value—200gp for gems
and 1,000gp for art objects.

Art Objects

Art Object Qualities

Value: Art objects commonly range in value from 300gp
to 1,800gp. Roll 3d6 × 100gp to determine the value of each
art object in a treasure hoard.
Type: Optionally roll on the Jewellery table or the Miscellaneous Art Objects table to determine the type of art object
present. Use common sense with regard to the types of
items found in a creature’s hoard. For example, while a
bejewelled comb might be found in the lair of an animal or
non-sentient monster (on the body of a victim), a well-preserved piece of antique furniture is less likely to be discovered in such a place.
Description: If desired, make a few notes on the materials
and embellishments that give each art object its value. See
Art Object Qualities for some ideas.
Weight: Small items (e.g. pieces of jewellery) weigh 10
coins, for encumbrance purposes. The Referee should
judge the weight of larger items.

Art objects are usually valued for their craftsmanship,
precious materials, embellishments, history, or a combination of all four. The following tables offer inspiration.

Magic Items
An overview of the 13 kinds of magic items and their uses.

I

tems woven with magic are, for many adventurers, the most sought-after form of treasure, granting wondrous capabilities that defy the limits of
nature and the rules of the game.

Magic Item Categories

Magic items are usually classified as one of the following
categories. Items of each category are described in the
following pages.
Amulets and talismans: Necklaces worn to grant magical
capabilities or to ward against harm.
Enchanted oddments: Miscellaneous items with minor
enchantments.
Magic armour: Grants bonuses to Armour Class. May be
enchanted with additional powers.

Magic balms and oils: Substances that bring about a magical effect when rubbed or poured onto a subject.
Magic crystals: Natural or worked stones with various
magical properties.
Magic garments: Boots, clothes, helmets, and other items
of apparel that place an enchantment about the wearer.
Magic instruments: Musical instruments that cause magical effects when played.
Magic rings: Plain or bejewelled rings that place an
enchantment about the wearer.
Magic weapons: Grant bonuses to Attack and Damage
Rolls. May be enchanted with additional powers.
Potions: Magical liquids, usually stored in glass vials. A
potion takes effect when drunk.
Rods, staves, and wands: Magical lengths of wood, metal,
crystal, etc. Enable spell-casters to unleash magical effects.
Scrolls and books: Aged sheets of parchment or tomes
inscribed with magical script.
Wondrous items: Enchanted items that do not fit into any
other category.

Identifying Magic Items

Certain characters can detect whether items are enchanted
(e.g. the magician’s Detect Magic skill or the holy spell
Detect Magic). Merely knowing that an object is magical
does not, however, reveal the exact nature of its enchantment and the powers it possesses.
Using magic items: When a character uses a magic item for
its intended purpose (e.g. playing an instrument, donning
a suit of armour, using a weapon in battle, etc.) they magically become aware of its powers and how to use them. Of
course, using a cursed item brings the character under the
effects of its curse.
Retainers: Players may ask retainers to test magic items,
in order to discover their unknown properties. Retainers
may agree to do this, but only if suitably compensated (e.g.
by being allowed to keep the item in question).
Magical analysis: Potions can be analysed and identified
by an alchemist (see Specialist Services, DPB). Specialised
spells to identify magic items also exist (e.g. Drouge’s
Arcane Unravelling—see Uncommon Spells, p454).

396

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

Using Magic Items

In order to be effective, a magic item must be used, held,
or worn after the normal fashion for that type of object.
Items that are always active: Magic items that must be
worn (e.g. amulets, armour, garments, rings, etc.) take
effect as soon as they are donned and remain active without any need for concentration. Likewise, enchantments
on magic weapons are always active.
Items that require activation: Magical effects of other
items must be intentionally activated. This counts as the
character’s action for a Round.
Actions per Round: A magic item’s effect can normally
be used only once per Round, unless its description notes
otherwise.
Cumulative effects: Unlike spells, multiple magic items
can increase the same statistic (e.g. bonuses to Attack, AC,
damage, Saving Throws, etc.).

Command Words (Optional Rule)

Wishes

Some magic items grant wishes, the powerful ability for a
character to change the nature of reality in any conceivable way that they desire. Wishes are generally regarded as
the most powerful magic in the game. The Referee must
handle wishes carefully so that the balance of the game is
not upset. Some adjudication guidelines follow.
Fundamental changes: A wish that would alter some
fundamental aspect of the game or the campaign world has
no effect. For example, a wish that altered the capabilities
of all monsters of a particular type would fail.
Greedy wishes: A wish that the Referee judges to be unreasonable or overly greedy may come to pass, but with its
intent twisted in some way. For example, a wish for a very
powerful magic item may cause the item to appear, but in
the possession of a dangerous enemy.
Wording: The player and Referee must pay great attention
to the precise wording of a wish. Ambiguous or incomplete
wordings may be twisted by the fates of magic.

At the Referee’s discretion, certain magic items may only
be activated by speaking a specific command word, which
must be known by the character. A command word may
occasionally be inscribed on an item, but otherwise discovering the appropriate command word for a magic item
may not be easy.

Wishing for more wishes: Results in an infinite time loop,
putting the character out of play.

Guesswork: Characters may be able to guess a command
word, perhaps using previous clues as to the nature of a
magic item or its creator.

Weapon: Wishing for a weapon to help fight magical
monsters. The wish grants an Arcane Longsword (p412)
that vanishes when the combat ends.

Recorded elsewhere: A command word may be written
on another object (e.g. in a book), which might be found
together with the magic item or in an entirely different
location.

Time reversal: Wishing that a monster had not attacked.
The wish places the characters a short way back in time and
changes the reaction of the monster.

Example Reasonable Wishes
Spell effect: Wishing for the effect of a specific spell. A wish
can duplicate the effect of any arcane or holy spell.

Obfuscation: Command words may be written in obscure
(even dead) languages, in code, in the form of a riddle, as
script that can only be read by magic, or in invisible script.
Lost command words: Sometimes a command word has
simply been lost. In this case, characters may need to
hire the services of a sage or employ divination magic to
discover the command word.

Buying and Selling
Magic Items

Although monetary values are listed for magic items, this
is mainly for the sake of the optional rule whereby magic
items grant XP (see p106).
Buying magic items: Aside from the occasional potion of
low value, it is very rare to find magic items for sale.
Selling magic items: Likewise, although PCs may occasionally wish to sell magic items, finding willing and sufficiently wealthy buyers is difficult. Nobles and powerful
NPCs (e.g. the Drune) are likely the only potential buyers.
Finding a buyer often requires significant time and effort.
Of course, PCs willing to settle for less than an item’s full
worth have an easier time selling it.

One Amulet or Talisman Only
If a character wears more than one amulet or talisman,
none of their magical effects function. Cursed amulets
or talismans do not count towards this limit and cannot
be deactivated by wearing more items.

398

Amulets and Talismans

1. Amulet of Breath: When placed in the mouth, allows the
wearer to breathe both in air and underwater.
2. Amulet of Density: Once a day, the wearer (along with all
their gear) can turn into either a cloud of vapour or a statue
of solid iron for as long as they wish. When in the form of
a cloud, the wearer has Speed 40, can seep through small
cracks, cannot attack, has AC 21, and can only be harmed
by magic. When in the form of a statue of iron, the wearer
cannot move, has AC 24, and can only be harmed by magic.
3. Amulet of Lightning: Appears worthless until worn.
The wearer perceives 2d4 small silver lightning bolts hanging from the amulet. Up to once a Round, the wearer can
detach and throw one of the small metal lightning bolts,
producing a stream of lightning 60′ long and 5′ wide. All in
the stream suffer 5d6 damage (Save Versus Ray for half).
Once all the lightning bolts have been thrown, the amulet’s
magic is spent.
4. Amulet of Mind-Reading: Grants the power to read
thoughts. By concentrating for 1 Round, the wearer may
target a creature within 30′. If the target fails a Save Versus
Spell, the wearer can read their surface thoughts. While
reading thoughts, the wearer may move, but cannot cast
spells or attack. The amulet is not entirely reliable: each
time it is used, there is a 1-in-6 chance of it misfiring,
instead sending the wearer’s thoughts to all within 30′.

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

9. Talisman of Devotion: Grants a +1 bonus to Armour
Class and Saving Throws against attacks and special
powers of Chaotic creatures, as well as creatures created
or summoned by magic. If the wearer is a devout follower
of the Pluritine Church (e.g. a holy spell-caster), they also
gain immunity to all forms of disease. While wearing the
talisman, the wearer becomes of Lawful Alignment.
10. Talisman of Dimensional Anchoring: Grants immunity to magic of teleportation and time alteration (e.g. the
Haste spell). Causes the wearer’s hair to grey prematurely.
11. Talisman of Free Action: Protects the wearer from all
forms of restraint, paralysis (but not petrification), and
slowing (but not encumbrance). For example, a character
wearing a Talisman of Free Action can slip out of bonds
or a Web spell, is immune to the spell Hold Person or the
paralysing touch of a ghoul, and is unaffected by magic
armour with the Freezing curse.
12. Talisman of Gaze Reflection: The wearer’s eyes take
on an odd, iridescent, mirrored hue. Gaze attacks (e.g. a
basilisk’s petrifying gaze) directly targeting the wearer
are reflected back and affect the attacker instead. After
2d4 gaze attacks are reflected, the talisman loses its power.
13. Talisman of Hex Attraction (cursed): Appears to be a
protective talisman of some kind. This cursed talisman
afflicts the wearer with a –4 penalty to Saving Throws
against curses and death magic (e.g. Word of Doom). The
talisman and its curse can only be removed by magic (e.g.
Remove Curse).
14. Talisman of Magic Resistance: Grants +2 Magic Resistance (applied to Saving Throws against magic).

15. Amulet of Pristine Sight: The wearer can see through all
illusions, and can perceive invisible objects and creatures.
The pristine sight is restricted to 30′ range. There is a 1-in-6
chance each day of the wearer being accosted by 2d6 yellow
sprites (DMB), striving to steal or destroy the amulet.
16. Amulet of Refraction: Once a day, the wearer can cause
1d4 illusory images of themselves to appear. The mirror
images look and behave exactly as the wearer, remaining within 3′. The wearer’s voice and any spells they cast
emanate randomly from one of the mirror images or the
wearer’s true form. Attacks on the wearer destroy one of
the mirror images (even if the attack misses). If the wearer
is an arcane spell-caster, they also gain the ability to cast
the spell Project Image once a week. While wearing the
amulet, the wearer casts no reflection.
17. Ioun Trap: Protects the wearer from­Ioun Shards (from
spells, wands, etc.). Ioun Shards that target the wearer are
trapped and harmlessly orbit their head forevermore. Each
time an Ioun Shard is trapped, there is a 1-in-20 chance of
the amulet’s magic expiring.
18. Talisman of Defence: Any who attack the wearer in
melee must Save Versus Hold or be paralysed for 1d4
Rounds (aware but unable to move or act, the triggering
attack misses). The charm is only effective against each
individual once per day.

19. Talisman of Non-Detection: Protects the wearer from
all magic of detection and divination pertaining to their
person or gear. Magic that detects the presence of some
force or quality (e.g. Detect Evil) simply fails to detect the
wearer. Magic that divines information about a subject (e.g.
Reveal Alignment) provides no information when applied
to the wearer. Even those who know the wearer tend to
forget their name.
16. Talisman of Protection: Grants the wearer an Armour
Class of 14, modified by Dexterity. Foiled attacks produce a
flash of prismatic light. If worn in conjunction with armour
that grants better than AC 14, the talisman has no effect.
17. Talisman of Protection From Hexes: Protects the
wearer from baleful magic, nullifying magic that places
a curse or causes instant death (e.g. Word of Doom). The
talisman works 2d6 times before its magic is spent.
18. Talisman of Protection From Scrying: Stymies all
attempts at scrying (e.g. a Crystal Ball) and mind-reading
(e.g. Crystal Vision) that target the wearer.
19. Talisman of Spell Reflection: Spells cast directly on
the wearer are reflected back and affect the caster instead.
After 2d6 spells are reflected, the talisman loses its power.
20. Talisman of Vitality: Grants the wearer a +4 bonus to
Saving Throws against poison and disease. If worn on a
daily basis, the talisman promotes vigorous hair growth.

Fairy oddities: Fairies are unaffected by oddities on fairy armour.

Magic Armour

Enchantment: All magic suits of armour and shields grant
the wielder a +2 Armour Class bonus.
Encumbrance: Magic suits of armour weigh 50% less than
normal armour of the same type and are treated as one
bulk category lighter, for encumbrance purposes only.
For example, magic chainmail weighs 200 coins and is
treated as Light armour, but still cannot be used by hunters
or thieves.
Size: Bark and pinecone armour are usually sized for
mosslings and other Small beings (e.g. grimalkins, woodgrues). Other types of armour are usually sized for humans
and other Medium beings (e.g. breggles, elves).
Tailoring magic armour: Magic armour can be tailored to
fit smaller or larger characters than it was designed for. See
Armour and Weapons, DPB. However, unless performed
by an armourer versed in enchantment, there is a 2-in-6
chance of the armour being rendered non-magical during
the process.
Cursed armour: Following the armour’s first use in battle,
the wielder comes under its curse and is unwilling to
relinquish it or use any other armour. Curses can only be
removed by magic (e.g. Remove Curse, Hex Weaving).

Types of Enchantment
Arcane: Constructed by mighty magicians. Engraved with
eldritch runes or constructed of unusual materials (e.g.
star-metal, iridescent crystal).
Fairy: Constructed by great fairy smiths or wrought from
wondrous materials originating in Fairy. Eerie or otherworldly appearance (e.g. wreathed in shadow, rimed with
frost).
Holy: Anointed in a sacred spring, blessed by a holy person,
or formerly wielded by a saint. Decorated with Liturgic
script or holy symbols.

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

Special Powers

Accelerating: Once a day may be commanded to warp time
around the wearer, enabling them to make 1 additional
attack per Round for 1d4 Rounds.
Barrier: Once a day may produce a 10′ radius warding
barrier that creatures of a specific type cannot enter.
The barrier moves with the wearer and lasts for 3 Turns.
Affected creatures may still make missile or magical
attacks against those within the barrier. (Eldritch barrier:
creatures created or summoned by magic.)
Beguiling: Mortals who successfully hit the wearer in
melee must Save Versus Spell or change sides for 1d4
Rounds, attacking the wearer’s foes and defending their
allies.
Energy reflecting: Magical beams of light or electricity
that directly target the wearer are reflected back at the
attacker. After reflecting 1d6 such attacks, the armour loses
this power.
Flight: Once a day the wearer may fly, levitate, and hover
for 3 Turns, with Speed up to 120.
Gaze reflecting: Gaze attacks are reflected back at the
attacker. After reflecting 1d6 such attacks, the armour loses
this power.
Healing: Once a day may heal 2d6+2 Hit Points to the
wearer.
Hex reflecting: Curses that directly target the wearer are
reflected back at the caster. After reflecting 1d6 curses, the
armour loses this power.
Holy circle: Once a day may produce a 10′ radius circle of
protection. Allies within the circle gain a +1 bonus to AC
and Saving Throws against the attacks or special powers
of supernatural creatures of Chaotic Alignment.
Incorporeality: Once a day the wearer may become
incorporeal for 3 Turns. In this state, the wearer can only
be harmed by magic or magical weapons, and can pass
through walls, doors, and other solid objects. They can
only make magical attacks against corporeal creatures.

Shocking: Once a day the armour can be charged with
electrical energy. If the wearer is hit in melee, the attacker
suffers 2d6 damage, discharging the electricity.
Spell reflecting: Spells that directly target the wearer are
reflected back at the caster. After reflecting 1d6 spells, the
armour loses this power.
Swimming: The wearer may swim with no risk of drowning, even in rough waters.
Tirelessness: The wearer may ignore the normal need for
rest when travelling. See Travel, DPB.
Vanishing: Once a day the wearer may disappear from
sight for 1d4 Rounds. The wearer gains +4 Attack against
foes that cannot detect invisible.
Ward: Grants a +2 bonus to Saving Throws versus a specific
type of effect. (Arcane ward: arcane magic. Breath ward:
breath attacks. Fairy ward: fairy magic. Holy ward: holy
magic.)

Oddities

Anointing: The armour’s enchantment bonus fades unless
it is ritually anointed in blood (arcane armour) or holy
water (holy armour) every day.
Covetous: The wearer is horribly possessive of the armour,
loathe for others to touch or even behold it.
Devoted: The wearer is obsessed with honouring a specific
saint (see p68), questing for shrines, relics, and so on.
Doomed (cursed): Incurs a –2 AC penalty, instead of the
normal +2 enchantment bonus.
Foe attraction: In combat, enemies within 10′ are 3-in-6
likely to attack the wearer, rather than an ally.
Freezing (cursed): If the wearer rolls a natural 1 on any
Saving Throw, they become rooted to the spot for 1 Turn.
Lying: The wielder is unable to speak entirely truthfully.
Their speech is veiled in lies and half truths.
Mirthful: The wielder is prone to levity, laughter, and
whimsy, even in the face of grave circumstances.

Levitation: Once a day the wearer may levitate for 3 Turns,
moving vertically through the air at 20′ per Round.

Missile attraction: Missile attacks against allies within 10′
are 3-in-6 likely to redirect to target the wearer.

Life protection: Protects the wearer from attacks that
drain Ability Scores or permanently reduce Hit Points.
After nullifying 1d6 such attacks, the armour loses this
power.

Questing (cursed): The wearer comes under a holy quest
of the Referee’s choosing, conveyed via prophetic dreams.
Should the wearer refuse to undertake the quest, they
suffer a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.

Refracting: Once a day may be commanded to conjure
1d4 illusory images of the wearer. The mirror images look
and behave exactly as the wearer, remaining within 3′. The
wearer’s voice, as well as any spells cast, emanate randomly
from one of the mirror images or the wearer’s true form.
Attacks on the wearer destroy one of the mirror images
(even if the attack misses).

Slumbering: The wearer suffers a –4 penalty to Saving
Throws versus sleep-inducing magic. Furthermore, each
time they sleep, there is a 1-in-6 chance of falling into an
enchanted slumber lasting 1d6 days, from which they
cannot be awoken.

Resistance: Grants a +2 bonus to Saving Throws versus
attacks of a specific type and reduces damage by 1 point
per damage die. (For example, 6d6 damage of the affected
type would be reduced by 6 points.)
Retribution: Inflicts 1d4 damage on supernatural creatures
of Chaotic Alignment that harm the wearer in melee.

Snow white: The wearer’s hair turns white.
Spell attraction: Spells that directly targets allies within
10′ are 3-in-6 likely to redirect to target the wearer.
Truthful: The wielder is instilled with utter honesty. They
are unable to lie or veil the truth.
Unyielding: When in combat with undead or supernatural
creatures of Chaotic Alignment, the wearer is compelled
to continue fighting until all such creatures within 60′ are
vanquished.

Balms and Oils

1. Alchemical Fire: An incredibly noxious black oil,
alchemically brewed from salamander bile. Alchemical Fire
is always stored in tightly stoppered clay flasks, sealed with
wax. Unstoppering: A gout of blue-yellow flame bursts
out of the flask, causing 1d4 damage to the character. If
they fail a Dexterity Check to replace the stopper, the flask
explodes, causing damage as follows. Throwing: The flask
can be thrown as a missile attack (range 10′ / 30′ / 50′). It
explodes on impact, inflicting 5d6 damage on the target
and all within 10′ (Save Versus Blast for half damage).
2. Anti-Magic Balm: A pearlescent white balm with a sweet
aroma that brings to mind memories of childhood. Effect:
If applied to a character, all magical effects they are subject
to (including both beneficial enchantments and curses) are
permanently removed. If applied to an object, the object is
rendered utterly non-magical for 1d6 hours.
3. Brewmaster’s Balsam: A black gloop in a sturdy glass
jar shaped like a miniature cauldron. Tastes sweet and
syrupy with an undertone of beef dripping. Effect: Applied
to wounds within 1 Turn of damage, the balsam heals 1d4
Hit Points. However, the substance has a soporific effect,
incurring a –1 penalty to Armour Class and Saving Throws
until a night’s rest is had. (This side-effect is cumulative, if
multiple doses are used.)

402

4. Deorling Balm: A resinous, white balm brewed from
pine sap and needles. Effect: If chewed and spat onto a
wound, the balm heals 1d6 HP or restores 1d6 points of lost
Constitution, leaving behind bark-like scar tissue.
5. Dimensional Solvent, Silver: A noxious smelling, metallic silver oil. Effect: When poured onto a character, they
double in size for 1d6 + 6 Turns, along with their equipment.
Their melee attacks inflict double normal damage.
6. Dimensional Solvent, Gold: A noxious smelling, metallic gold oil. Effect: When poured onto a character, they
shrink to 6″ high for 1d6 + 6 Turns, along with their equipment. The character can slip through small spaces and
hide behind small objects, but is unable to harm creatures
larger than 1′ tall.
7. Holy Oil: Sweet-smelling, amber oil blessed by a saint
of the Pluritine Church. Stored in ceramic flasks engraved
with holy liturgies. Throwing: The flask can be thrown as
a missile attack (range 10′ / 30′ / 50′). It smashes on impact,
inflicting 3d8 damage on an undead monster plus 3d8
damage on the subsequent Round, as the oil drips off.
8. Hunter’s Balm: A transparent, yellowish balm that has
the scent of a different animal each time it is smelled.
Effect: Renders a character utterly odourless for 1d6 hours,
making them impossible to track by scent. Creatures that
rely primarily on scent (per the Referee’s judgement) suffer
a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls against the character.

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

9. Ointment of Weightlessness: A thick, slippery balm
of scintillating, pearly hue. Smells of fresh rain. Effect:
Renders a creature (Small or Medium) or object (up to 5,000
coins of weight) utterly weightless for 1d6 + 6 Turns. An
affected creature can will itself to move vertically through
the air up to 20′ per Round.
14. Orgon’s Sovereign Lubricant: A thin, pinkish oil with a
metallic odour. Effect: When poured onto a subject (a character or object), it becomes impossible to grasp or restrain.
The subject is immune to constriction attacks and able to
instantly slip out of webs, rope bonds, chains, and so forth.
If applied to a floor, a flask covers a 10′ × 10′ area. Creatures
walking through the area have a 95% chance per Round of
slipping over (unable to move or act further that Round).
Effects last for 8 hours.
15. Phantasmal Unguent: An obsidian balm twinkling
with silver motes. Effect: Renders a solid object (up to 5′
diameter) or section of wall (5′ diameter, up to 10′ deep)
intangible for 1d4 + 4 Turns. The affected object or section
of wall appears normal, but creatures and solid objects can
pass through it.

16. Morphic Unguent: A syrupy, orange balm that smells
of tar. Effect: Changes a character’s physical form into
another imagined humanoid form for 1d6 + 6 Turns. The
character’s physical features (e.g. weight, skin colour, hair
colour, hair length, etc.) may be altered in any way, their
sex and Kindred may change, and they may change in
height by up to 1′. The unguent may be used to duplicate the
appearance of a specific individual, as long as the character
can clearly imagine them. Those familiar with the copied
individual may Save Versus Spell to detect the ruse.
17. Nebulous Ointment: A fluffy, grey ointment that smells
of rain and feels like wisps of cloud. Effect: Renders a character unable to sink in water for 1d4 + 4 Turns. Even heavily armoured characters may thus swim without risk of
drowning.
18. Oil of Sharpness: A fine, golden oil with a subtle, rainbow-hued scintillance. Effect: Renders a bladed or pointed
weapon magical for 1d6 + 6 Rounds. While enchanted, the
weapon grants a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls and
is effective against monsters that can only be harmed by
magic. The oil has no effect if applied to a weapon that is
already magic. A flask of Oil of Sharpness contains 4 applications.
19. Oil of St Signis: A thin, iridescent black oil with an
odour of mothballs. Effect: Protects a corpse from the natural processes of decay, preserving it indefinitely. The corpse
is also prevented from rising as undead of any kind. A flask
of the oil is sufficient for 8 Medium or 12 Small corpses.
This oil is used by the Lichwards to preserve the bodies of
nobles and bishops.

20. Salve of Repulsion: A cream-coloured, oily balm whose
odour is utterly repulsive to creatures of one specific
species or Kindred (e.g. deer, grimalkins, humans, wyrms,
etc.). To creatures of other kinds, the salve is odourless.
Effect: Applied to an object or area, the scent can be
detected up to 120′ away, for 1d6 hours. Creatures of the
affected type must Save Versus Spell or be unable to
approach closer than 120′. Those who make the save may
approach, but suffer a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving
Throws while in the affected area.
17. Solvent of Whispers: A slightly transparent oil of deep
indigo hue that emits sibilant noises when moved. Smells
faintly of almonds. Effect: Renders a subject (a character
or object onto which the solvent is poured) utterly silent
for 1d4 + 4 Turns. The subject cannot produce sound, either
by its own volition (e.g. speech) or by contact with other
objects (e.g. a hammer pounding).
18. Spectral Oil: A thin, transparent oil with a slightly
iridescent hue, stored in opaque clay flasks. If exposed
to light, the oil loses its magical properties unless used
within 1 Turn. Effect: When poured onto a character, they
become incorporeal for 1d4 + 4 Turns, along with their
equipment—able to move through walls, doors, and other
solid objects, like a ghost. The subject can only be harmed
by magic or magic weapons.
19. Thieves’ Salve: An indigo salve found in tiny quantities
in miniature crystal jars. Smells of musty crypts. Effect:
When applied to a character’s nose, grants the ability to
smell treasure for 1d6 + 6 Turns. The subject can sense the
direction and distance of the largest treasure hoard within
360′. The magic is blocked by lead. A jar of Thieves’ Salve is
sufficient for 4 uses.
20. Viridescent Balm: A deep emerald green balm that
smells of spring rain. Effect: Instantly cures the subject
of all diseases and poisons. If the subject is in good health
(i.e. not suffering from disease or poison), the balm instead
permanently increases their maximum Hit Points by 1.
An individual can benefit from the HP increase at most
three times ever.

Magic Crystals

Ioun Stones

1. Crystal Ball: A perfect, polished sphere of clear crystal,
6″ across. Gazing into the crystal, an arcane spell-caster
can view any place or object that is brought to mind. The
vision lasts for 1 Turn. Its clarity is dependant on the scryer’s familiarity with the subject—for example, the scryer’s
own home could be viewed with great clarity, whereas a
place the scryer has only heard of would produce a faint,
blurry image. A Crystal Ball may be used up to thrice a day.
Weight: 50 coins.

Small (1–2″), floating crystals of different shapes and
hues, each granting a different magical boon. Ioun
Stones are said to originate in a distant, otherworldly
dimension, known to magicians as “Ioun.” While Ioun
Stones are especially coveted by magicians, they can be
used by all characters.

2. Crystal of Sepulture: A faceted, 1′ tall, ovoid crystal of
pale blue or violet hue. Placed within a case or cabinet
by an arcane spell-caster, the crystal floats and rotates
slowly, absorbing the soul of any sentient being that dies
within 120′. Victims cannot be raised from the dead, unless
the soul is released by the caster. Trapped souls may be
consumed to extend the duration of a spell or other magical effect. For each soul consumed, the spell is extended
for one third of its initial duration. For example, a Haste
spell (duration 3 Turns) would be extended by 1 Turn per
soul. Weight: 50 coins.

Stealing: Stones may be grasped or netted to separate
them from their owner.

3. Dweomer Shard: A rough-cut aquamarine crystal that
emits a faint, pulsing warmth when touched by an arcane
spell-caster. If placed in a flow of arcane energy (e.g. a ley
line), the crystal charges up, becoming purple-tinged and
eventually purplish-black when fully charged (6 hours).
Once fully charged, the crystal contains a random Rank 1
arcane spell. An arcane spell-caster can identify the spell
by touch and can cast it at will, releasing the stored energy
and returning the crystal to its “empty” state.
4. Ioun Stone, Absorption: A pale lavender ellipsoid that
absorbs and negates spells of Rank 3 or lower cast at the
character. After absorbing a total of 1d3 × 10 Ranks of spells,
the stone burns out and turns to dull grey, forever useless.
See Ioun Stones.
5. Ioun Stone, Agility: A deep red sphere that increases
the character’s Dexterity by 1 (to a maximum of 18). See
Ioun Stones.
6. Ioun Stone, Breath: An iridescent spindel that sustains
the character without air. See Ioun Stones.
7. Ioun Stone, Fortitude: A pink rhomboid that increases
the character’s Constitution by 1 (to a maximum of 18). See
Ioun Stones.
8. Ioun Stone, Insight: An incandescent blue sphere that
increases the character’s Wisdom by 1 (to a maximum of
18). See Ioun Stones.
9. Ioun Stone, Intellect: A striated scarlet and blue sphere
that increases the character’s Intelligence by 1 (to a maximum of 18). See Ioun Stones.
10. Ioun Stone, Might: A pale blue rhomboid that increases
the character’s Strength by 1 (to a maximum of 18). See
Ioun Stones.
11. Ioun Stone, Presence: A striated pink and green sphere
that increases the character’s Charisma by 1 (to a maximum of 18). See Ioun Stones.

Activating: A stone’s power is activated when it is held
then released beside the character’s head, whereupon
it takes up a circling orbit 1–3′ around the head.

Attacking stones: AC 20 and 10 Hit Points.
Storing: The character may grasp an orbiting stone to
store it, temporarily deactivating its power.
13. Ioun Stone, Sustenance: A clear spindle that sustains
the character without food and water. See Ioun Stones.
14. Lenses of Reflection: A pair of 2″, transparent grey, lensshaped crystals, attached to a leather strap. When affixed
over the eyes, the wearer is immune to gaze attacks (e.g. a
basilisk’s gaze—DMB).
15. Lenses of Sight: A pair of 2″, transparent, lens-shaped
crystals, one pink, the other azure. Looking through the
pink lens, one sees out of the azure lens. The pair of lenses
operates at any distance.
16. Lens of Penetration: A 2″, transparent blue, lens-shaped
crystal. Looking through the lens, one sees through all
fairy glamours of illusion.
17. Leystone: A 3″ shard of translucent crystal, deep green
or blue in colour, slightly warm to the touch. Placed in the
palm of the hand, the crystal points towards the nearest ley
line. In a hex containing a nodal stone, the crystal slowly
rotates.
18. Loadstone (cursed): A roughly hewn piece of ornamental stone (e.g. agate—see Gems and Art Objects, p394)
which afflicts the owner with a curse of slow movement.
The character’s Speed is halved and they can only attack or
cast spells every second Round. The curse takes effect when
the character attempts to flee from an enemy (whether in
combat or in pursuit). If the stone is discarded, it reappears,
hidden somewhere on the character’s person, unless the
curse is removed by magic (e.g. Remove Curse).
19. Luckstone: A roughly hewn piece of ornamental stone
(e.g. agate—see Gems and Art Objects, p394) which grants
its owner good luck. The character gains a +1 bonus to
Saving Throws and Ability Checks.
20. Moonstone: A perfect, polished sphere of silver-grey
crystal, 6″ across, engraved with geomantic and astrological sigils. If placed for a night beneath the light of the full
moon, the stone becomes charged with the moon’s light.
Once successfully charged, the stone radiates a lambent,
bluish light in a 30′ radius until the moon is next full.
Weight: 50 coins.

21. Ioun Stone, Regeneration: A pearly white spindle that
heals 1 Hit Point per Turn. See Ioun Stones.

Magic Garments

1. Belt of Blending: A belt of glimmering fish skin with a
buckle of silver thorns. The wearer can blend into a crowd
(10 or more people) and not be clearly recalled. The wearer
also has difficulty recalling their own name.
2. Belt of Hounds: A broad leather belt emblazoned with
portraits of 8 noble hounds—one per type of hound
listed in the DPB. If the wearer lovingly strokes one of the
hounds, it leaps from the belt, manifesting as a dog of the
corresponding type. The hound serves the wearer for 24
hours before vanishing (along with the image on the belt).
3. Belt of Might: A broad leather belt with patterns of metal
studs. Grants the wearer Strength 18 (+3). They may also
ignore 1,000 coins (or 10 items) of encumbrance.
4. Boggin-Hair Cloak: A cloak of thick, green weedlike boggin hair, perpetually sodden and dripping, but
perfectly warm. Cast upon a body of water, the cloak functions as a small rowing boat capable of carrying up to 2
people and their gear. A pole or oars are required to propel
the boat.
5. Boots of Andromethia: Cherry blossom petals that
swathe a character’s feet, warming and protecting like
stout travelling boots. As the wearer walks, the boots leave
a trail of petals in their wake. This reduces the party’s
chance of getting lost in difficult terrain to 2-in-6 (see
Travel, DPB). Following the wearer is trivial.

406

6. Boots of the Plains: Soft suede boots with soles covered
in fresh, green blades of grass. When travelling overland,
the wearer moves with Speed 80 (16 Travel Points a day).
After a day travelling at this rate, the wearer must rest for
1 day, unable to move at greater than Speed 10.
7. Boots of Weft-Striding: Supple leather boots threaded
with a mesh of fairy silver. The wearer gains the ability to
step through the fabric of reality. Up to thrice a day, they
may make a small step and be transported to a selected
location up to 30′ away. The wearer may even step into
mid-air and not fall, though without a means of propulsion
(e.g. pushing along a wall), they cannot move.
8. Cloak of Displacement: A cloak of black, shimmering
scales that bends light, making the wearer appear to be 5′
away from their true location. The wearer gains a +2 bonus
to Saving Throws against attacks that directly target them
(e.g. wands, spells, gaze attacks, etc.). Attacks Rolls against
the wearer are penalised by –2.
9. Cloak of Leaves: A long, voluminous cloak of oak leaves
that change with the seasons, from freshly unfurling buds
in spring, to deep and lustrous greenery in summer, to
shades of golden orange in autumn, to mere skeletons in
winter. The cloak’s magic also changes with the seasons:
in spring it grants the wearer a +2 bonus to AC, in summer
a +2 Attack bonus with missile weapons, in autumn a +2
bonus to Survival Checks for hunting and foraging, and
in winter a +2 bonus to Constitution Checks for sleeping.

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

10. Cobweb Socks: Long socks woven of sticky cobwebs.
If wearing nothing else on their feet, the wearer can walk
up vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings. The
wearer gains a taste for eating raw insects.
11. Hearty Companion Cloak: A normal-looking woollen cloak with a brass clasp in the form of a merry face.
If the clasp is fed 1 ration of food and a sip of alcohol in
the evening, the cloak produces a hearty warmth for the
wearer throughout the night. Weather conditions and lack
of fire or camping equipment do not prevent the wearer
getting a good night’s rest.
12. Helm of Realignment (cursed): A beautifully crafted
silver helmet. Donning the helmet instantly causes the
wearer’s Alignment to change to a new, randomly determined Alignment (re-roll duplicates). Once donned, the
helmet and its Alignment-changing curse can only be
removed by magic (e.g. Remove Curse).
13. Helm of Teleportation: A beautifully crafted silver
helmet. Grants the wearer the ability to cast the arcane
spell Teleport on themselves once a day. Arcane spell-casters may cast Teleport up to thrice a day and are able to cast
the spell on other creatures or objects if desired.
14. Lichen Cloak: A ragged cloak of patched, dank-smelling,
multi-hued lichen. When motionless, the wearer can blend
into trees or stone, appearing as a large patch of lichen.
15. Mushroom Cap: A floppy leather cap laced with mycelia and covered in rampant growth of a random edible
fungus (see p118). The fungi are sufficient for 1 ration.
If consumed, a new batch of fungus grows the following dawn—1 ration of a random edible type, plus a 1-in-6
chance of a portion of a random special type (see p428).
16. Pickpocket’s Glove: A silk glove embroidered with
sprite motifs. When the glove is worn, non-living objects
(up to 100 coins weight) in contact with it are rendered
invisible. Object becomes visible when contact ceases.
17. Robe of Eyes: A luxurious robe adorned with dozens of
eye motifs. The wearer can see in all directions at once, can
see normally in darkness (up to 60′), can perceive invisible
(up to 60′), and can plainly see anyone hiding or using
camouflage. The robe’s visual powers prevent the character
from being surprised. The holy spell Light, cast directly on
the robe, causes the wearer to be blinded for 1d4 Rounds.

Magic Garment Sizing
When first discovered, a magic garment may be sized
to fit a human, a smaller humanoid (e.g. a grimalkin),
or a larger humanoid (e.g. an ogre). However, when a
magic garment is donned it changes size, adapting to
the stature of the wearer.

Multiple Garments
If a character wears multiple magic garments of the
same kind (e.g. two magic cloaks), their magical effects
do not function. Cursed garments do not count towards
this limit and cannot be deactivated by wearing more
magic garments.

Robe of Useful Items Patches
The robe has the following patches when found: two
daggers, two 10′ poles, two lanterns (lit and filled with
oil), two sacks, two small mirrors, two 50′ ropes, 4d4
items rolled on the table below.

18. Robe of Useful Items: A plain, unremarkable robe. Fairies, demi-fey, and arcane spell-casters who don the robe
notice a series of cloth patches sewn into it, shaped like
items—see Robe of Useful Items Patches. Other characters
cannot perceive the patches or use the powers of the robe.
Patches on the robe can be removed (take 1 Round), permanently turning into the corresponding item.
19. Scholar’s Cap: A floppy felt cap embroidered with
mystic sigils. The wearer gains the ability to read writing
of all kinds, including text in all languages and magical
text (e.g. created by Arcane Cypher).
20. Sprite-Wing Cloak: A diaphanous cloak formed of
thousands of iridescent sprite wings, stitched together
with spider silk. When moving carefully (maximum half
Speed), the wearer is rendered almost invisible: there is
only a 1-in-6 chance of them being spotted. The invisibility
is nullified for 1 Turn if the wearer attacks or casts a spell.

Encumbrance: Stringed instruments weigh 50 coins; wind
instruments weigh 20 coins.
Doodlepipe: A pipe with a bladder surrounding the reed.
Squamp: Several cured gourds bored with holes and fitted with
pipes. Fed from a single mouthpiece. Popular among mosslings.

Musical Proficiency
The magic of an enchanted musical instrument can
only be activated by a skilled musician, as follows.
Bards: Can play all instruments.
Woodgrues: Can play all wind instruments.
Other characters: A character’s background may imply
proficiency with certain types of musical instruments,
at the Referee’s discretion.

Noise
Playing a musical instrument is a noisy affair. At the
Referee’s discretion, this may incur an additional check
for wandering monsters.

Enchantments

Animation: Once a day, animates 1d6 corpses, skeletons, or household tools (e.g. rolling pins, brooms, scissors) within 30′. As long as the musician plays, they can
command the animated subjects to perform any tasks
desired. The subjects must remain within 30′. Subjects may
be commanded to attack—see stats to the right.
Blasting: Up to once a Turn, releases a blast of destructive noise. Creatures within a 100′ long cone (20′ wide at
the end) suffer 2d6 damage (Save Versus Blast for half).
Affected creatures are also deafened for 1 Turn (Save Versus
Spell to avoid). At the Referee’s discretion, the noise may
also be able to damage objects and buildings (e.g. a single
blast might be enough to destroy a simple cottage; a 10′
section of castle wall might require three blasts).
Calling: Attracts the attention of animals or bugs of a
specific type (e.g. bears, giant rats, giant spiders). If any
creatures of the affected type are present within 400′,
2d6 individuals arrive in 2d6 Rounds. The instrument’s
magic does not influence the creatures’ attitude towards
the musician, which should be determined by the Referee
(possibly using a Reaction Roll—see Encounters, DPB).
Chaos: All creatures within 30′ must Save Versus Spell or
be stricken with delusions, unable to control their actions.
The Saving Throw is repeated each Round. Roll 2d6 for
each affected subject each Round: 2–5: attacks allies; 6–8:
confused, no action; 9–12: attacks foes.
Cooking: Once a day, magically conjures a hearty meal
sufficient for 12 people. A cooking pot or other vessel must
be to hand. There is a 1-in-20 chance per usage that eating
the food has the effect of a random rare fungus (p428)
or rare herb (p430).
Dance of the dead: Undead within 30′ must Save Versus
Spell (incorporeal undead gain a +2 bonus) or dance a
nonsensical jig as long as the musician keeps playing.
Afflicted undead cannot move, attack, or perform any
other actions. Subjects that are attacked (physically or
magically) cease to be affected.
Enraging: Creatures of a specific type (e.g. breggles, elves,
wolves, wyrms) within 30′ must Save Versus Spell or be
enraged by the instrument’s music. Enraged creatures
attack the musician and allies as long as the music persists.
Entanglement: Once a day, causes mundane plants in 20′
radius area up to 80′ away to bend and twist, attempting
to entangle creatures within their grasp. Creatures in the
affected area must Save Versus Hold or be entangled and
unable to move until the musician stops playing.
Fascination: Animals of a specific type (e.g. bears, cats,
rodents) within 30′ are fascinated by the instrument’s
music. Subjects must Save Versus Spell or sit and raptly
listen to the music, perhaps singing along according to
their art. If the musician moves, fascinated subjects will
follow. Any interruptions (e.g. loud noise or violence) end
the fascination.
Frothing: Under normal circumstances, playing the
instrument has no special effect. In perilous circumstances
(e.g. in the presence of hostile monsters), playing it causes
a mass of bubbles to froth out and envelop the musician’s
face. This causes blindness for 2d10 Rounds.

Morale 12 XP 10
Non-biological: Immune to biological effects (e.g.
disease, poison) and mind-affecting spells (e.g. Vapours
of Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).
Jackanapes: Once a day, conjures 1d6 gobbles (DMB)
dressed in dapper waistcoats and jester hats. Each gobble
carries either a cymbal, a trumpet, or a small cudgel (1d4
damage)—selected at random. The animals are obedient, if rambunctious, and obey the musician’s mental
commands. The gobbles vanish as soon the musician stops
playing.
Levitation: Causes the musician and all unsecured creatures and objects within 10′ to float upwards at a rate of 10′
per Round. As soon as the music stops, levitated subjects
drop back to the ground.
Obscurement: Conjures a cloud of misty vapour around
the musician. After the first Round of playing, the vapour
fills a 10′ radius area. The radius expands by 5′ per additional Round of playing, up to a maximum radius of 60′.
The vapour blocks all vision, except the musician’s (who
can see 10′ in the vapour) and those able to see invisible. It
remains for 4 Turns, or 1 Turn in windy conditions.
Opening: Playing for 1 Turn causes a single door, lid, or
other portal to open. All mundane locks and bars are
bypassed. Magical locks and wards are suppressed for
3 Turns. After being used 2d10 times, the instrument
becomes non-magical.
Panic: All creatures within 120′ must Save Versus Spell or
flee from the sound of the instrument for 1 Turn. Those
within 10′ of the instrument are not affected.
Ravening: All creatures within 60′ must Save Versus Spell
or be afflicted with ravenous hunger. Creatures with access
to food will drop anything in their hands and immediately consume the available food for 1d6 Rounds. Creatures
without food will move as fast as possible to the musician’s
location and will attempt to kill and eat anyone present.
Each Round a creature eats, it may Save Versus Spell to end
the ravenous hunger.
Revelry: Listeners suffer a –2 penalty to any Saving Throws
against mad revelry effects played on the instrument. See
the woodgrue Kindred, DPB.
Sending: Thrice a day, the instrument can send a message
(up to 20 words) drifting on the winds. The winds carry
the message to a known person or location up to 24 miles
distant, travelling at a rate of 1 mile per Turn.
Slumber: Causes animals, demi-fey, and mortals within
30′ to become drowsy. After hearing the music for 1 Turn,
subjects must Save Versus Spell or drift off to sleep. Slumbering subjects are awoken by loud noise or violence.
Warning: The instrument’s music is only audible to allies
of the musician, and can thus be used to send alarms,
alerts, or warnings.

magical effects do not function. Cursed rings do not
count towards this limit and cannot be deactivated by
wearing more magic rings.

Magic Rings

1. Ring of Amphibious Breath: The wearer can breathe
both in air and underwater.
2. Ring of Animal Affinity: The wearer can speak with
animals of one specific species (e.g. deer, ravens, wolves,
etc.) and may transform into an animal of that type (and
back) at will. The transformation does not alter the character’s Hit Points, Save Targets, Attack, or intelligence.
Physical capabilities of the new form (e.g. strength, physical attack forms, modes of movement) are acquired.
Non-physical special traits or powers (e.g. immunities,
breath weapons, spell casting) are not acquired. While
transformed, the character is unable to cast spells.
3. Ring of Charming: Allows the wearer to place a charm
on sentient creatures of a specific type (e.g. breggles, elves,
humans, etc.). A total of up to 6 Levels of creatures may be
charmed at once. Targets of lower than Sentient intelligence are immune. Each target must Save Versus Spell or
regard the wearer as a close friend. They will come to the
wearer’s defence and will obey their commands, as long
as these are not obviously harmful and do not contradict
the subject’s habits or Alignment. The wearer may dispel
the ring’s hold on a subject at any time. Removing the ring
dispels its effects on all subjects.

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

4. Ring of Control: Grants the power (up to once a Turn)
to control the actions of non-sentient creatures of a
specific type (e.g. animals, bugs, plants, etc.). A total of up
to 6 Levels of creatures (minimum 1 individual) within 60′
may be affected at once. Targets of Sentient intelligence or
greater are immune. Using the ring requires concentration, broken if the wearer moves or performs any other
action. Creatures released from command are 1-in-6 likely
to attack the wearer.

5. Ring of Invisibility: The wearer becomes invisible,
along with all their gear. The invisibility lasts until the
character removes the ring, makes an attack, or casts a
spell. The ring’s magic functions up to once per Turn.

6. Ring of Delusion (cursed): The wearer comes temporarily under the effect of another type of magic ring, but
all effects vanish at a critical juncture (as determined by
the Referee).

6. Ring of Protection: Grants a +1 bonus to Armour Class
and Saving Throws.

7. Ring of Duomorph: When wearing the ring, the character physically changes into an alter-ego of a different
gender. The exact characteristics of the alter-ego (e.g.
appearance, voice, etc.) are determined by the Referee
when the ring is first used by a character.
7. Ring of Encystment: Has the power, once a day, to magically store an object within solid rock. The object may be
up to 2′ across and must fit within a volume of nearby rock.
Magically stored objects can be released by a command
word chosen by the wearer.
8. Ring of Energy Resistance: Protects the wearer against
harmful energy of a specific kind (e.g. cold, fire, lightning).
The wearer is immune to normal, non-magical energy.
They gain a +2 bonus to Saving Throws against magical
energy and any damage is reduced by 1 per damage die
rolled. (For example, 4d6 damage is reduced by 4.)
9. Ring of Enfeeblement (cursed): Reduces the wearer’s
Strength to 3. The ring and its curse can only be removed
by magic (e.g. Remove Curse).
10. Ring of Feather Falling: If the wearer falls more than
5′, they begin to drift gently downwards as if as light as a
feather. They fall at a rate of 10′ per Round and land without
damage.
11. Ring of Jumping: The wearer can make great leaps, up
to 30′ horizontally and up to 10′ vertically. The ring’s power
can be used up to thrice a day.

12. Ring of Mortality: Renders a fairy or demi-fey temporarily mortal, while the ring is worn. The wearer is thus
immune to any effects that target fairies / demi-fey, and
is not harmed by cold iron. It is not possible to use fairy
glamours while wearing a Ring of Mortality.

14. Ring of Regeneration: As long as they are alive (above 0
HP), the wearer heals 1 Hit Point per Round. Severed limbs
will also regrow—the rate depends on the size of the limb
(e.g. a finger may regrow in a day, while a whole limb may
take a week). Damage from fire or acid cannot be regenerated.
15. Ring of Selective Invisibility: The wearer becomes
invisible (along with all their gear) to the sight of a specific
type of creature (e.g. animals, fairies, mortals, etc.). The
invisibility lasts until the character removes the ring,
makes an attack, or casts a spell. The ring’s magic functions
up to once per Turn.
16. Ring of Vanishing: Has the power, once a day, to teleport
the wearer to a chosen location within 60′ and to render
them invisible for 2d6 Rounds, along with all their gear.
Attacking or casting a spell breaks the invisibility.
17. Ring of Vision: Grants the power to see through solid
objects by concentrating (no movement or other actions).
Sight is possible up to 30′ through stone and up to 60′
through less dense materials (cloth, water, wood). Gold
and lead block sight. When used for the purpose of locating
hidden features (see Hidden Features under Hazards and
Challenges, DPB), the wearer is guaranteed to notice secret
doors or traps in the 10′ square area being examined. The
ring’s power functions up to once per Turn.
18. Ring of Water Walking: Grants the power to walk on
the surface of water, without sinking.
19. Ring of Wishes: Grants the wearer three wishes (see
Wishes, p397). Once all wishes have been used, the ring’s
magic is spent.

Magic Weapons

Enchantment: All magic weapons grant the wielder a +2
bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls and are effective against
monsters that can only be harmed by magic.
Magic missiles: Lose their enchantment once fired.
Magic missile weapons: If a magic missile is fired from a
magic weapon, both enchantments apply. For example,
firing a magic arrow from a magic bow grants a +4 bonus
to the Attack and Damage Rolls.
Weapons of special metals: For metal weapons, there is an
optional 1-in-6 chance of the weapon being made of either
cold iron or silver.
Cursed weapons: Following the weapon’s first use in
battle, the wielder comes under its curse and is unwilling
to relinquish it or use any other weapon. Curses can only
be removed by magic (e.g. Remove Curse, Hex Weaving).

Types of Enchantment
Arcane: Constructed by mighty magicians. Engraved with
eldritch runes or constructed of unusual materials (e.g.
star-metal, iridescent crystal).
Fairy: Constructed by great fairy smiths or wrought from
wondrous materials originating in Fairy. Eerie or otherworldly appearance (e.g. wreathed in shadow, rimed with
frost).
Holy: Anointed in a sacred spring, blessed by a holy person,
or formerly wielded by a saint. Decorated with Liturgic
script or holy symbols.

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

Special Powers

Accelerating: Once a day may be commanded to warp time
around the wielder, enabling them to make 1 additional
attack per Round for 1d4 Rounds.
Bane: Enchanted to vanquish creatures of a specific type.
When used against creatures of the listed type, the weapon’s damage bonus increases to +4. (Eldritch bane: creatures created or summoned by magic. Giant bane: Large
humanoids. Were bane: werewolves. Wizard bane: arcane
spell-casters.)
Defender: Each Round of combat, the wielder may choose
to apply the weapon’s +2 bonus to AC instead of Attack.
Disintegrating: Victims slain by the weapon are utterly
annihilated, leaving no physical remains.
Elf friend: Grants the wielder the ability to understand
(but not speak) High Elfish.
Flaming: Once a day may be commanded to burst into
flames for 1d6 Rounds, casting light in a 20′ radius and
inflicting an additional 1d6 damage per hit.
Flying: Once a day may be commanded to fly from the
wielder’s grasp and independently attack a foe up to
30′ distant (using the wielder’s Attack bonus). After 1d4
Rounds, the weapon returns to the wielder.
Frost-rimed: Once a day may be commanded to produce
an aura of cold for 1d6 Rounds, inflicting an additional 1d6
damage per hit.
Growing: Once a day may be commanded to double in
length for 1d6 Rounds, allowing the wielder to attack foes
up to 10′ distant.
Guileful: Once a day the wielder may cause their appearance to become completely nondescript for 1 Turn. This
allows them to escape notice by any who seek them.
Holy radiance: Once a day may be commanded to manifest
glorious light in a 30′ radius for 1d4 Rounds. Undead within
the radiance must Save Versus Hold or be paralysed for
the duration of the light (aware but unable to move or act).
Impact: In addition to suffering damage, victims must
Save Versus Hold or be flung 1d3 × 10′ back.
Light bringer: Once a day may be commanded to conjure
silvery light in a 15′ radius for 1 hour.
Marshall: Once a day may be raised aloft to counteract fear
in allies within 20′. Those afflicted with magical fear may
Save Versus Doom to regain their courage.
Moon sight: Grants the wielder the ability to see in moonlight as if at full noon.
Shrinking: May be commanded to shrink to miniature
size (2–3 inches) and to return to normal size.
Succouring: Once a day may heal 1d6+1 Hit Points to a
subject touched.
Vampiric: The wielder heals 1 Hit Point on each successful
hit with the weapon.

Oddities

Ageing: The wielder ages 1d6 years after each combat in
which the weapon is used.
Aligned: Strongly enchanted with a particular Alignment.
Creatures of opposite Alignment that touch the weapon
suffer 1d6 damage. (Neutral-aligned weapons harm both
Lawful and Chaotic creatures.) Following the weapon’s
first use in battle, the wielder permanently changes to the
same Alignment.
Arrogant: When the weapon is used in battle, the wielder
is compelled to seek out and attack the largest foe in melee.
Bloodthirsty: Once drawn, the weapon cannot be
discarded or sheathed without drawing blood.
Covetous: The wielder is horribly possessive of the weapon,
loathe for others to touch or even behold it.
Devoted: The wearer becomes obsessed with honouring
a specific saint (see p68), questing for shrines, relics,
and so on.
Doomed (cursed): Incurs a –2 penalty to Attack and Damage
Rolls, instead of the normal +2 enchantment bonus.
Hallowed: The wielder becomes obsessed with giving creatures slain with the weapon a proper burial.
Lying: The wielder is unable to speak entirely truthfully.
Their speech is veiled in lies and half truths.
Mirthful: The wielder is prone to levity, laughter, and
whimsy, even in the face of grave circumstances.
Possessed (cursed): When used in battle, the wielder must
Save Versus Spell or come under the control of the vengeful fairy spirit that inhabits the weapon. The spirit forces
the wielder into a battle frenzy for 1 Turn, wildly attacking
the closest creature (be it friend or foe), until it is slain, then
moving onto attack the next nearest creature.
Questing (cursed): The wielder comes under a holy quest
of the Referee’s choosing, conveyed via prophetic dreams.
Should the wielder refuse to undertake the quest, they
suffer a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
Slumbering: The wielder suffers a –4 penalty to Saving
Throws versus sleep-inducing magic. Furthermore, each
time they sleep, there is a 1-in-6 chance of falling into an
enchanted slumber lasting 1d6 days, from which they
cannot be awoken.
Treacherous (cursed): On a natural 1 Attack Roll, bends to
strike the wielder, inflicting normal damage.
Truthful: The wielder is instilled with utter honesty. They
are unable to lie or veil the truth.
Unyielding: When in combat with undead or supernatural
creatures of Chaotic Alignment, the wielder is compelled
to continue fighting until all such creatures within 60′ are
vanquished.

Vanishing: Once a day the wielder may disappear from
sight for 1d4 Rounds. The wielder gains +4 Attack against
foes that cannot detect invisible.
Venger: When the wielder is damaged in melee, they may
instantly make a return attack with the weapon.
Wasting: Causes the target to age 1d6 years per hit.

bottles of dark crystal. If unstoppered: Casts amber light
in a 30′ radius for 6 Turns. May be sealed and reopened
multiple times. Monsters affected by sunlight are vulnerable to Bottled Light.
5. Distillation of Hoarfrost: A pale blue liquid shot through
with jagged ice crystals. Numbs the tongue. Effect: Renders
the imbiber immune to non-magical heat and fire, and
grants a +2 bonus to Saving Throws against magical fire.
Furthermore, fire-based damage is reduced by 1 per

414

damage die rolled. (For example, 4d6 damage is reduced
by 4.) Effects last for 1d6+6 Turns.
6. Elixir of Mutability: A viscous, amethyst liquid that
is unaffected by gravity. Effect: Transforms the imbiber
into another being of their choice for 1d6 + 6 Turns. The
transformation fails if the new form’s Level is greater
than the imbiber’s. The transformation does not alter
the character’s Hit Points, Save Targets, Attack, or intelligence. Physical capabilities of the new form (e.g. strength,
physical attack forms, modes of movement) are acquired.
Non-physical special traits or powers (e.g. immunities,
breath weapons, spell casting) are not acquired. While
transformed, the character is unable to cast spells.
7. Essence of Springtime: A clear liquid with the odour
of a fresh spring day. Tastes of cherry blossom. Effect:
Reverses the effects of ageing, causing a mortal or demifey to become 10 years younger. Fairies must Save Versus
Doom or fall into a coma for 2d6 days.
8. Essence of Sweet Dreams: Dreams filched from the
innocent minds of sleeping children and distilled into a
violet spirit stored in delicate perfume bottles. If applied
as a perfume: Grants a +1 bonus to Saving Throws Versus
Spell for 6 Turns. Sufficient for 4 applications. If drunk:
Induces a night of deep rest and ambrosial dream, even in
the most uncomfortable of conditions.

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

9. Liquid Time: A curious liquid with constantly changing
visual and tactile qualities—viscous then watery, transparent then opaque, lilac then scarlet. Smells and tastes of the
imbiber’s favourite tipple. Effect: Accelerates the imbiber’s
passage through time, doubling Speed and enabling twice
the normal number of attacks or other actions per Round.
Lasts for 1d6+6 Turns. This time acceleration causes the
imbiber to age 1d6 years.
10. Orgon’s Scintillating Philtre: An iridescent spirit that
must be stored in crystal to retain its unusual properties.
Smells faintly of almonds and has no flavour, but evokes a
curious “flashing” of hot and cold sensations in the mouth
and throat when consumed. Effect: Heals 1d6 Hit Points. If
drunk within 2 hours of having consumed another potion
(including previous doses of the philtre), the imbiber must
Save Versus Doom or vomit up the philtre, wasting it.
11. Philtre of Delusion (cursed): This potion has the appearance of another randomly selected potion. Effect: The
imbiber comes temporarily under the effect of the other
type of potion, but all effects vanish at a critical juncture
(as determined by the Referee).
12. Philtre of Doom (cursed): This potion has the appearance of another randomly selected potion. Effect: The
imbiber must Save Versus Doom or die instantly. Even a
tiny sip is deadly.
13. Philtre of the Winds: A tempestuous, cloudy fluid of
blue and grey with the odour of rain and the taste of damp
earth. Effect: Grants the ability to fly, levitate, and hover
for 1d6+6 Turns, with Speed up to 120.
14. Philtre of Wondrous Vitality: A deep purple liquid of
thin, vaporous consistency that evaporates within seconds
following contact with air. Smells strongly of cinnamon
and elicits a shocking heat in the mouth when drunk.
Effect: Has a 3-in-6 chance of reviving a subject killed by
damage (i.e. not by poison, disintegration, etc.) within the
last 3 Rounds. Returning from death is an ordeal: until the
subject gets two full weeks of bed rest, they have 1 Hit Point,
half Speed, cannot carry heavy items, and cannot attack,
cast spells, or use other Class capabilities. This period of
weakness may not be shortened by any magical healing.
15. Prismatic Elixir: A pulsing, rainbow-hued liquid that
is always found in octahedral glass containers (required
retain its magical properties). Odourless but has a zingy
metallic taste. Effect: Instantly heals 1d6+1 Hit Points.

Identifying Potions
Potions can be identified by an alchemist (DPB) or by
players who learn to recognise their qualities. Characters bold enough to take a small sip of a potion can also
gain a hint as to its effects, as the character is briefly
affected by the magic. The Referee should describe a
minor magical effect that the sampling character experiences, hinting at the full effects of the potion.
17. Vanishing Philtre: An invisible liquid, only detectable
by its weight, motion, and consistency. Smelling the philtre
causes a brief blacking out of vision. It tastes like robust
port. Effect: Renders the imbiber (and all gear) invisible for
1d6+6 Turns, or until they attack or cast a spell.
18. Vaporous Spirits: A thin, lime green fluid always stored
in a tightly stoppered container. Evaporates into a gas
immediately upon being unstoppered. A character must
decide instantly whether to imbibe it or let it escape. Effect:
The imbiber’s body (but not gear) is transformed into a
cloud of vapour for 1d6+6 Turns, moving at Speed 40 and
able to seep through small cracks. While in gaseous form,
the character cannot attack, but has AC 21 and can only be
harmed by magic.
19. Wereform Elixir: A substance that separates into a
thin, yellow liquid and a brown sludge. Must be mixed
before use. Effect: Transforms the imbiber into animal
of a specific kind (determined by the potion’s creator) for
1d6+6 Turns. The type of animal must be non-magical, at
most Level 2, and of at most Animal intelligence. The transformation does not alter the imbiber’s Hit Points, Save
Targets, Attack, or intelligence. Physical capabilities of the
new form (e.g. strength, physical attack forms, modes of
movement) are acquired. While transformed, the character
is unable to cast spells.
20. Wyrmsblood Elixir: A thick, opaque liquid of deep
crimson or plum. Radiates a distinct warmth, smells of ash,
and tastes acidic and metallic. Effect: Grants a +2 bonus to
Armour Class and Saving Throws for 1d6+6 Turns. If drunk
within 1 week of having consumed another dose, the effect
is inverted: –2 to AC and Saving Throws.

21. Sandor’s Phantasmal Elixir: A frothing indigo liquid
that smells of sulphur and tastes of dry earth. Effect: The
imbiber falls into a deep coma for 1d6+6 Turns, their spirit
rising from the comatose body as a translucent phantom.
The spirit may roam where it will, moving with Speed 40,
able to pass through walls, doors, and other solid objects. It
cannot attack, cast spells, or influence the world in any way,
but may be harmed by magic and magic weapons, having
Armour Class 20. When the potion’s duration expires, if
the spirit has not returned to the body the character must
Save Versus Doom. If the save fails, the body dies and the
spirit is lost in unknown dimensions.

Charges

Rods, staves, and wands have a limited number of uses,
called “charges.” The number of charges in an item when
discovered is determined by the Referee—see the Rod /
Staff / Wand Type table.
Usage: Each use of a rod, staff, or wand takes 1 Round and
consumes one charge. When the last charge is consumed,
the item loses its magical potency.
Recharging: It is normally not possible to add charges to a
rod, staff, or wand. The Referee may sometimes allow this
if a special quest or research process is performed.

416

Rods

Dimensions: Around 1″ thick, 3′ long. Weigh 20 coins.
Usage: Holy spell-casters only.
In combat: A rod can be used as a melee weapon, inflicting
1d4 damage.
Powers: Each rod can cast a specific holy spell, selected by
the Referee or rolled on the Rod Spell table.
Value: A rod is worth 5,000gp per Rank of the spell it
casts. (e.g. a Rod of Raise Dead—a Rank 5 spell—is worth
25,000gp.)

Staff Special Powers
Absorption: When a spell is cast at the wielder, the staff
absorbs its energy, negating its effect. This uses one charge
per Rank of the spell. The staff gains an equal number of
stored energy Ranks. Stored energy Ranks may be used to
cast spells which the wielder has memorised. When doing
so, a number of stored energy Ranks are expended equal
to the Rank of the spell cast. Spells cast in this way are not
lost from the character’s memory. Value: 40,000gp.
Cancellation: Renders an item touched utterly non-magical. If the targeted item is being used by another creature,
the wielder of the staff must make an Attack Roll against AC
10 to hit it. A Staff of Cancellation can only be used once—it
has but a single charge. Value: 15,000gp.
Darkness: Conjures a 15′ radius area of magical darkness in
a fixed location. The darkness lasts 6 Turns. Value: 5,000gp.
Detection: Reveals the presence of objects of one specific
type (e.g. secret doors, traps, masses of metal over 1,000
coins) within 20′. Value: 10,000gp.
Dominion: Allows the wielder to cast Dominate on creatures of one specific type (e.g. animals, fish, humans,
mammals, serpents, wyrms). The wielder can also speak
with creatures of that type, without using a charge. Value:
20,000gp.
Negation: Negates the powers of a targeted rod, staff, or
wand within 60′ for 1 Round. The wielder must declare use
of the staff before initiative is rolled. If they lose initiative,
the negation has no effect. Value: 15,000gp.
Striking: After making a successful hit in combat, the
wielder may spend a charge, inflicting 2d6 additional
damage. Value: 15,000gp.
Summoning: Summons a creature of a specific type (e.g.
brambling, insect swarm, manikin, root thing—DMB).
The creature arrives in 1d4 Rounds and obeys the wielder’s commands for 2d4 Rounds before vanishing. Value:
5,000gp per Level of the creature summoned.
Transformation: The staff can transform into a creature
of a specific type (e.g. adder, carrion worm, giant python),
which follows the wielder’s commands. The transformation lasts for 2d4 Rounds. If the creature is killed, it does
not return to staff form, rendering the staff useless. Value:
5,000gp per Level of the creature.
Withering: After making a successful hit in combat, the
wielder may spend a charge, causing the victim to age 10
years. Creatures that do not age (e.g. constructs, undead,
fairies) are unaffected. Others die upon reaching their
natural lifespan. Value: 35,000gp.

Caster Level
For spell qualities (e.g. range, duration) that vary by
caster Level, the caster is treated as at least Level 6 (for
wands) or Level 8 (for rods and staves).

Staff Spell Groups
The wielder can cast any of the listed spells by expending
a charge.
Crypts: Animate Dead, Dark Sight, Word of Doom. Value:
35,000gp.
Glyphs: Glyph of Locking, Glyph of Sealing, Serpent Glyph.
Value: 20,000gp.
Illusion: Hallucinatory Terrain, Mirror Image, Phantasm.
Value: 25,000gp.

Control Scrolls

Reading the script of a control scroll aloud grants the reader
power to control the actions of creatures of a specific type
(see the Control Scroll table).
Creatures: A total of up to 16 Levels (minimum 1 individual)
of creatures of the affected type can be controlled. Each
subject may Save Versus Spell to resist the scroll’s magic.
Commanding: The character can only control creatures
that they can see and must concentrate to exercise control
(no movement or other actions). Controlled creatures do
not obey commands that are deadly to themselves. Creatures of Sentient or greater intelligence also do not obey
commands that are contradictory to their habits or Alignment.

Protection Scrolls

Reading the script of a protection scroll aloud conjures a
10′ radius circle of protection around the reader, shielding
them against a specific type of creature or hazard (see the
Protection Scroll table). The circle of protection moves
with the reader.
Protection against creatures: A total of up to 40 Levels
of creatures of the affected type are barred from entering the circle of protection. The circle does not prevent
affected creatures from using magic or missile attacks
against those within it. If anyone within the circle attacks
an affected creature in melee, the circle is broken. Otherwise, it lasts for 6 Turns.

Duration: 1d6 + 6 Turns. When the duration ends, affected
creatures have a hostile reaction toward the reader.

Protection against hazards: Hazards of the specified type
cannot cross the circle of protection in either direction
(entering or leaving). The circle lasts for 1d4 Turns.

Cursed Scrolls

Spell Scrolls

Example Curses

Spells on a scroll: The number and Rank of spells on a
scroll are rolled randomly. First roll on the Spell Number
table to determine how many spells are on the scroll. Then,
for each spell, roll on the Spell Rank table. Once a spell’s
Rank has been determined, the Referee may choose or roll
the specific spell from the lists in the DPB.

Merely looking at the script on a cursed scroll activates
its baneful magic. The reader must Save Versus Doom or
come under the curse. The Referee should determine the
nature of the curse (see examples below). Curses can only
be removed by magic (e.g. the holy spell Remove Curse).

1. Transformation: The reader changes into a harmless
creature (e.g. a frog).
2. Summoning: A monster appears next to the reader and
attacks (gaining surprise). The monster is of equal Level to
the reader.
3. Lost item: A magic item in the reader’s possession
vanishes. The Referee may select the item or choose it at
random.
4. Energy drain: The curse reduces the victim’s maximum
Hit Points by 1d4 and incurs a –1 penalty to Attack Rolls and
Saving Throws.
5. Prime Ability loss: The character’s Prime Abilities are
reduced by half.
6. Slow healing: The reader’s healing capacity is reduced.
Natural healing takes double the normal amount of time,
and magical healing cures only half the normal number
of Hit Points.

The magically charged text on a spell scroll triggers a spell
effect when read. Only a spell-caster of the appropriate
type (arcane or holy) may activate a spell scroll’s magic.

Casting: When a spell is cast from a scroll, the words of the
spell vanish from the scroll.
Level and Rank: A spell-caster of any Level may cast spells
from a scroll, even if they are not able to memorise spells of
appropriate Rank. For spell qualities (e.g. range, duration)
that vary by caster Level, the caster is treated as at least
Level 6.
Value: Scrolls are worth 500gp per Rank of spell. For example, a scroll of two Rank 3 spells is worth 3,000gp.

Wondrous Items

1. Astrolabe of the Aegis: An intricate brass astrolabe,
10″ wide, of Drune make, detailing the movements of the
moon and stars in relation to the ley lines of Dolmenwood.
Arcane spell-casters can use this device to travel through
Dolmenwood’s ley lines. When in a hex which a ley line
passes through, a spell-caster can step into the ley line
and travel astrally along the course of energy at a rate of
24 miles per hour. Characters of Level 5 or greater can take
up to 4 companions with them into the ley.
2. Bag of Devouring (cursed): A normal-looking sack that
devours objects placed inside it. Anything placed inside
the bag vanishes from existence after 1d6+6 Turns. Living
creatures may be affected, but only if the entire creature
fits inside the bag.
3. Bag of Holding: A normal-looking sack that can magically hold large objects and weights. Objects of up to 10′ × 5′
× 3′ can fit inside the bag. Up to 10,000 coins of weight can
be placed in the bag. When full, the bag weighs 600 coins.
4. Boggle Lantern: A lantern of brass and pink glass which
the owner can light or extinguish on command. Once a
day, the owner can summon 1d3 marsh lanterns (DMB)
to serve for 6 Turns.

420

5. Eye of the Yurl: A glass eye with a cat-like iris of pale
violet, said to have been created by a mythical grimalkin
ancestor known as the Yurl. When placed against a creature’s eye (or empty eye socket), the glass eye liquefies and
seeps into the eye socket, dissolving the creature’s own
eye (if present) into a purple jelly. The subject may Save
Versus Doom to resist, casting the glass eye aside. The Eye
of the Yurl grants the subject normal vision, the ability to
see through cloth and wood, and the ability to see in the
dark up to 30′.
6. Fairy Jar: A 4″ high glass jar of deep purple or pale pink
hue. The spirit of a fairy is trapped in the jar, visible as a
tormented face swathed in swirling mist. Smashing the
jar frees the spirit, which grants the character a boon (e.g.
permanent +1 to an Ability Score) before dissipating. The
spirit is magically compelled to offer to serve a character
who addresses it (up to once a day). Acceptance requires a
Save Versus Doom. If the save succeeds, the spirit either
reveals a random lesser fairy rune (DPB) or casts a previously revealed rune on the character’s behalf. If the save
fails, the spirit cannot be contacted for 2d6 days. On a natural 1 save, the jar shatters and the spirit escapes, placing a
curse on the character (per the arcane spell Hex Weaving).
7. Horseshoes of Lightness: A set of 4 iron horseshoes
which, when affixed, allow a horse to float slightly above
the ground. The horse leaves no tracks and can move across
water as if it were solid ground. The magic is only effective
if all 4 horseshoes are worn.

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

8. Horseshoes of Speed: A set of 4 iron horseshoes which,
when affixed, double a horse’s Speed. The mount can travel
at this speed for up to a whole day, allowing the rider to
travel great distances. After travelling at speed for more
than 4 hours in a day, the horseshoes do not function for
24 hours. The magic is only effective if all 4 horseshoes
are worn.
9. Knife of Separation: A short-bladed knife with a notably
blunt blade. Slicing across a living creature’s appendage
(e.g. limb, tail, neck) allows body parts to be harmlessly
detached. Detached body parts are independently mobile
and can be reattached by touching them back onto the
creature’s body.
10. Leaf Dome: A bundle of compressed leaves, fresh
green as if picked from trees in high spring. If placed on
the ground and watered, the bundle erupts into a verdant
canopy providing shelter for up to 4 people. Beneath the
leaf canopy, a pleasant coolness pervades—treat as springtime, for the purposes of camping. Punctually at dawn, the
leaf dome collapses back into a bundle.
11. Marvellous Pigments: A pot of magical paint which can
be applied to a flat surface (e.g. wall, door, floor, ceiling)
to conjure a real, permanent, three-dimensional object.
The artistic skill of the character has no bearing—the
object magically flows from the paint brush, guided by
the character’s imagination alone. Only non-magical,
inanimate things may be conjured (e.g. rooms, portals,
armour, equipment, trees, flowers, pits, passages, etc.).
Apparently precious objects may be conjured, but they
are always constructed of low value materials. Painting an
object takes 1 Turn. Each pot of the pigments is sufficient to
cover a 10′ × 10′ surface, conjuring an object of up to 1,000
cubic feet (e.g. 10′ × 10′ × 10′).
12. Mirror of Life Trapping: A mirror with the ability to
magically trap living creatures behind its pane. Small or
Medium creatures who gaze into the mirror must Save
Versus Spell or be sucked inside, along with their belongings. Up to 20 creatures can be trapped in the mirror, where
they will live indefinitely, without the need for air or sustenance, and unaffected by ageing. When 20 creatures are
trapped, it becomes safe to look into the mirror. Trapped
creatures may converse with those outside, but are utterly
powerless. Breaking the mirror releases those trapped.
13. Mirror of Youthfulness: An enchanted looking glass
that veils its possessor’s true appearance with one of youth
and fey beauty. The owner must spend at least 1 hour per
day gazing at their reflection in the mirror. The mirror
has no power to actually stop ageing, it merely veils the
owner’s appearance.
14. Needles of Hexing: A set of enchanted embroidery
needles that can place curses remotely by embroidering a
likeness of the intended victim. Once the victim’s likeness
has been embroidered with the needles, any cursing magic
cast upon it (e.g. using the arcane spell Hex Weaving) affects
the victim as if they were present.
15. Petrified Fairy Heart: A fist-sized heart of black stone
which emits a slow, pulsing frigidity. The owner gains a +1
bonus to Saving Throws against fairy magic. If powdered
and consumed, the dust rejuvenates a mortal by 1d20 years
per dose (12 doses in total).

16. Portable Hole: A 6′ diameter circle of fine black cloth
that can be folded down to the size of a handkerchief. The
cloth can be placed upon a surface (floor, wall, ceiling, etc.)
to conjure a 6′ diameter, 10′ deep hole in the surface. The
cloth can subsequently be picked up by a creature inside
or outside of the hole, causing the hole to vanish. Anything
inside the hole when the cloth is picked up remains in an
extra-dimensional space. A living creature inside the hole
can unfold the cloth (if they have it) to recreate the hole at
its last location. The hole contains enough air for 1 Turn.
17. Purse of Plentiful Coin: A small leather pouch which
can magically duplicate coins placed inside it. When found,
the purse contains 26 coins of each type (cp, sp, gp, pp). Each
morning, the purse duplicates any coins left in it, producing up to 25 coins of each type it contains. For example, if
a single gold piece is left in the pouch, the following day it
will contain 26gp. If completely emptied, the purse permanently loses its magical power.
18. Rope of Climbing: A coil of thin, strong rope, 50′ in
length. The owner may command the rope to climb in any
direction, and may command it to attach to a surface. The
rope can hold loads of up to 10,000 coins of weight.
19. Skeleton Key: A magical key, carved from thin bone,
that opens any lock (mundane or magical). Using a Skeleton Key bypasses any traps or wards upon the lock. Each
key can be used only once, crumbling to dust afterwards.
Usually found in sets of 2d3 keys.
20. Sylvan Bracelet: A silver bracelet of seven interlocking
leaves that allows the wearer to speak with plants and fairies. When activated, the wearer gains the ability to speak
either the Sylvan tongue for 24 hours or to communicate
with plants for 3 Turns. Normal plants may inform the
character of creatures that have recently passed or may
perform simple favours (e.g. clearing passage, tangling
into an impassable thicket). The magic can be used seven
times—upon each use, one of the leaves “wilts.”

Trade Goods
Oddities and essentials carried by the beings that trade within Dolmenwood.

I

t is not uncommon to encounter traders and
merchants of various kinds along the roads and
wild paths of Dolmenwood. Mortal pedlars wend
their way along the roads between settlements, laden
with packs of essential items and rare luxuries. Goblin
merchants bring exotic goods from the odd realms of
Fairy to sell to wide-eyed mortals. Scrabey traders emerge
from their subterranean realm to exchange oddities with
surface-dwellers.

422

Determining Trade Goods
1. Types of goods: The type of goods carried are listed
under Possessions in a creature’s stat block. (e.g. a
creature may carry fairy and herbal trade goods.)
2. Types of items: For each type of goods carried, roll
once or twice (Referee’s choice) on the corresponding
trade goods table (see opposite) to determine the
type of items carried.
3. Number of items: If PCs wish to purchase multiples
of a single type of item (e.g. multiple bottles of wine,
multiple doses or a herb, multiple days’ worth of
rations, etc.), roll the dice listed in the Num. column
of the table to determine the number of items of that
type the trader has available for sale.

Enchanted Oddments

1. Boggle Mask: A wooden mask with bulging eyes, twisting horns, and a sinister fanged grin. The wearer of the
mask takes on the appearance of a terrifying horned
demon, veiling their true form, clothing, and equipment.
The effect is purely visual. When removed, the mask bursts
into flame and vanishes.
2. Clockwork Beetle: A 3″ brass contraption that resembles
an oval-shaped brooch with a winding key on the underside. Winding key causes legs, wings, and mandibles to
pop out. Once activated, the beetle flies in a straight line
at Speed 30. It can carry a small object (weighing up to
40 coins). The beetle flies until manually deactivated or
until it winds down (1 Turn). After each use, there is a 1-in-6
chance of the beetle exploding in a mess of tiny gears.

3. Crystal Illusion: A pouch of faceted crystal fragments,
scintillating with pink, cerulean, and indigo light. If
crushed, the fragments release a fleeting, glowing, lifesize illusion of a noble elf bowing, pirouetting, or whirling
a sabre. The illusion lasts for 1d6 Rounds.
4. Dreaming Burl: A chunky tree burl, 8″ across, covered
with face-like gnarls and whorls. When lit in a fire pit, the
burl slowly burns (8 hours), emitting a soothing greenish-orange glow and a hearty aroma reminiscent of a cosy
tavern. Characters sleeping by the fire gain a +1 bonus to
any Constitution Checks required to sleep (see Camping,
DPB) and experience comforting dreams of merry, burlfaced fairies. A random injured character is blessed by the
burl-fairies and heals 1 HP.
5. Dust of Ages: A pouch of sooty grey powder. When sprinkled over an object or creature, the dust makes it appear as
an aged and decrepit version of itself. People and animals
become old and grey, objects become tattered and dusty.
The illusion is purely visual and lasts for 6 Turns.
6. Eternal Flower: A delicate bloom plucked at its peak
and frozen in time. If treated gently, it retains its beauty
(and value) for all eternity. Greatly valued by mortals of
noble means. Value: 10gp for a dainty snowdrop, 50gp for
a spring-fresh tulip, 250gp for a pristine water lily, 500gp
for a majestic black rose.

424

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

7. Fairy Comb: An elegant comb of ivory or wyrm-bone,
shaped like a fanciful bird with tooth-feather wings. By
brushing the comb through their hair for 1 Turn, the user
can change their hair to any colour and style desired.
8. Fairy Swan Feather: A long, elegant feather of pearlescent white. If a character holds the feather tight against
their chest, closes their eyes, and thinks happy thoughts,
they begin to float 1′ off the ground. The character cannot
move through the air of their own volition, but drifts if
pushed by an outside force. The levitation lasts as long as
the character concentrates with their eyes closed. When
concentration ends, the feather vanishes in a wisp of
smoke.
9. Fire Powder: A bag of shimmering dust of a particular,
vivid hue (the dust comes in any colour of the rainbow).
Tossing the powder into a flame causes it to change colour
to match the powder and to flare up, doubling its light
radius. The colour change lasts as long as the flame burns,
and the brightness lasts for 1 Turn.
10. Frozen Birdsong: Flakes of glittering hoarfrost, stored
in a glass bottle swaddled in thick felt. If thawed, the melting flakes release a beauteous symphony of birdsong, as if
a chorus of nightingales, blackbirds, thrushes, and finches
were greeting the dawn. All within 30′ of the birdsong
suffer a –2 penalty to any Saving Throws against enchanted
music (e.g. played by a bard or woodgrue). The song echoes
around for 1 Turn, then fades.
11. Ghost Crow Quill: A shadowy, semi-corporeal feather.
Writing made using the quill fades and is only visible
under moonlight.
12. Gold Leaf: An autumn birch leaf that glitters like real
gold. Crushing the leaf and sprinkling the dust over an
object makes it appear to be made of solid gold. The effect
is purely visual and lasts until washed off with water. A
single leaf is enough to affect a single object weighing up
to 50 coins.

13. Jar of Seasons: A stoppered clay jar painted with
scenery corresponding to one of the four seasons. When
opened, a miniature weather pattern whisks out of the jar
and occupies a 30′ radius area for 8 hours. Once released,
the weather pattern cannot be returned to the jar. Comes
in 4 varieties: winter (chilly wind, 3′ snowfall), spring (tiny
clouds, rainfall), summer (golden sunbeams, warmth),
autumn (gusts of wind and brown leaves).
14. Redcap’s Mug: A tankard of green wood with a hinged
lid in the form of a jolly, grinning face. Often carved with
woodland scenes or animals dancing arm-in-arm. Once
a day, a pint of water poured into the tankard is instantly
transformed into cold, dark beer when the lid is replaced.
15. Salamander Seed: A bright red seed, 2″across, with a
tiny wick-like stem. When the stem is lit, the seed rapidly
grows into a mass of fiery red creeper vines covering a 20′
radius area. The vines latch firmly onto surfaces (including
vertical surfaces within their area of extent) and can be
used for climbing or anchoring. Creatures caught in the
vines when they grow must Save Versus Hold or be entangled, unable to move. Another save is allowed each Round
to escape. The vines wither and disappear after 1d6 hours.
16. Steed Stump: A small, uprooted tree stump (1′ across)
with several thick roots at the base. Sitting on the stump’s
flat, cut surface and speaking a command word (typically
“whalloop”—the Sylvan equivalent of “giddyup”) brings
the stump to life, its roots scrabbling like legs. The stump
acts as a mount for 24 hours before rotting away to slime.
The stump has Speed 40 with a Small rider and 20 with a
Medium rider. It can carry one character and all their gear.
17. Wizard’s Pipe: A smoking pipe of fine red clay with
a long stem inscribed with astrological symbols. When
stoked with leaf, the smoker can blow smoke into any
shape desired, so long as it is no larger than 1 cubic foot.
The forms produced by the pipe are obviously smoky apparitions.

18. Grave Wax Candle: A lumpy candle shaped like a
crooked finger. While lit, it gives off the faint, sickly sweet
odour of a fresh corpse. The candle’s flame sputters and
pops when brought within 30′ of an undead creature.
Burns for 3 Turns.
14. Growling Tree Face: A scowling, human-like face of
gnarled bark, ringed with drooping lichen and moss. If
placed upon a tree trunk, the face adheres and opens its
eyes, peering this way and that. Upon sighting a sentient
being close by (30′), it grumbles wordlessly (audible within
60′). Fairies sometimes set these faces as guardians around
a camp. A Growling Tree Face functions for 8 hours, then
crumbles to dust.
15. Hungry Shadow: A drawstring pouch that wriggles and
growls when touched by light. Opening the bag releases a
monstrous blot of shadow that slithers along walls, floors,
and ceilings to devour all light in a 15′ radius, creating an
area of magical darkness. The patch of darkness lasts for 6
Turns, after which the shadow disappears.

Rare Comestibles

1. Azoth: A russet residue made from the crystals in the
caves around Fog Lake. Crystals collected from the caves
are boiled down, producing a sludge which re-crystallises
when cooled. Oddly, the process must be completed while
the lapping of the lake is within earshot, or the drug will
be ineffective. If smoked: A full out-of-body experience
results, the subject’s soul drifting where it will. While the
voyager experiences vast tracts of time passing, the effects
last for 1d4 Turns in reality. Following an Azoth trip, the
subject’s ability to empathise with others is dulled for 1d4
days. Repeated use of Azoth attracts extra-planar pests (e.g.
astral leapers—see hex 1209).
2. Fairy Fruits: Wondrously succulent peaches, apples,
pomegranates, plums, and bunches of grapes, dripping
with syrup. Fairy fruits stay fresh indefinitely, untouched
by the ravages of time in the mortal world. If eaten: Each
fruit provides nourishment for a whole day. True fairies
(excluding demi-fey) heal 1 HP (up to thrice a day). Mortals
must Save Versus Spell or be struck with a yearning to
get lost in Fairy. Eventually, eating more Fairy Fruit is the
only thing that brings joy. (Bless or magic of curse removal
reverses this malady.)

426

3. Frisk: A sticky, luminescent paste; actually the seminal fluid of the night-boars that sometimes visit Dolmenwood. Odourless, but has a faint, bitter flavour. If eaten:
The subject’s sense of empathic connection with other
sentients is amplified. The subject cannot lie and can detect
the lies of others (50% chance per lie). All effects last for
1d6 hours.
4. Golden Aspintheon: A legendary draught said to be only
distilled in Fairy. The spirit has a rich, golden hue, glimmering with motes of silvery radiance. Its taste is exquisite and
differs based on the preferences of the imbiber. If drunk:
Elicits a state of sublime joviality, where one rejoices in the
company of friends and is at peace with the world.
5. Green Aspintheon: A deep green spirit, swirling with
enigmatic clouds. The flavour is of bitter herbs tempered
with the sweetness of spring nectar. If drunk: Brings on a
merry boisterousness. After 1d6 Turns, the subject gains
the fleeting ability (for 1 Turn) to clearly perceive invisible
fairies, much to the vexation of such creatures.

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

6. Ishwagrande: A resinous ochre dust that smells strongly
of pine sap. If burnt: Fills a 20′ radius area with dense,
purple smoke for 1 Turn. The smoke completely obscures
vision. Any who inhale it must Save Versus Doom or fall
unconscious for 1 Turn. While unconscious, victims experience nightmarish visions of an alien dimension and
are stricken with a curse of befuddlement. The afflicted
have their Wisdom reduced to 3 and change Alignment
randomly each day. Used with the arcane spell Oracle,
Ishwagrande can be used to open a channel of direct
communion with an extra-dimensional intelligence.
7. Kitty-Nibbles: Little, crunchy almond-flavoured biscuits,
each baked with a cat’s paw-print in the top. If eaten: Sends
grimalkins and other felines into an accelerated frenzy,
granting a +1 bonus to Attack Rolls for 1 Turn. Non-felines
gain no effect, though the nibbles are rather tasty.
8. Lethe: A silvery ooze typically contained in rough clay
bottles. Has an odour akin to rust. Lethe is distilled from
the brains of those who have bathed in the Lethean Well
(hex 0209). If vaporised and inhaled: The subject enters
into a mentally cleansing state of intense introspection
and questioning of life motives, lasting 1d3+3 hours. Afterwards, they gain +2 Wisdom (maximum 18) for 24 hours.
If disturbed during the period of introspection, they fly
into a violent rage.
9. Mallow-Puff: Pale violet pipeleaf, loosely chopped.
Smells of rich, smoky, apple and burns with a bright white
flame. If smoked: Once per Turn for 2d6 Turns after smoking, the subject is able to puff out a little cloud of violet
smoke. While the cloud remains (1 Turn), the subject can
direct its movement at will, with Speed 20.
10. Memory Dust: A fine, pearlescent dust, renowned
for its ability to expand the mind’s capacity for the energies required by arcane spell memorisation. If snorted:
Grants an arcane spell-caster the ability to memorise a
single extra spell (of any Rank they can cast). The Dust is
highly addictive: after every use, the subject must make a
Wisdom Check. If the check fails, they suffer a –2 penalty
to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws until they use the Dust
again. A natural 1 indicates that the subject’s tolerance for
the Dust has increased: from now on they must consume
an additional dose to achieve the same effect.
11. Ourob: A thick, swirling mushroom brew of indigo,
black, and purple hue that is brewed by mosslings. Reeks
of acidic rot. Good vintages are fermented for at least 5
years. If drunk: Characters resilient to fungal poison (e.g.
mosslings) experience amusing digestive bubbles and
gurgles, followed by a mighty belch that pacifies fungal
creatures within 20′ (behave only defensively for 1 Round).
Others vomit the stuff up immediately and must Save
Versus Doom or suffer 1d3 damage.
12. Prigwort Black: A pure black spirit that tastes of aniseed
with an undertone of lemon. Once the pride of Prigwort’s
distillery House Oberon, the art of producing this spirit
was lost a century ago. If drunk: Elicits a sharpness of mind
and open-minded inquiry. After 1d6 Turns, the subject
gains the fleeting ability (for 2 Turns) to perceive shimmering, colourful auras around sentient creatures. Focusing
on an individual’s aura for 1 Turn reveals their Alignment
to the imbiber.

13. Purple Shag: Thick-cut, deep purple pipeleaf dotted with
pale yellow, scintillating crystals. Smells of dewy grass and
produces a thin, sweet-scented smoke. If smoked: Lends
an air of frivolity and bolsters the spirit for 2d6 Turns. The
subject gains a +1 bonus to Morale Checks and a +2 bonus
to Saving Throws versus fear effects.
14. Shandycoiffe Sparkle: A deep pink sparkling wine
brewed from the fruits of Lord Gladhand’s orchards. Smells
of luscious, ripe fruit—a different kind on each smelling. If
drunk: Causes the drinker’s skin and hair to change colour
for 1d6 Turns, in a continuous procession of rainbow hues.
Dispels any magic of polymorph affecting the drinker.
15. Snobble’s Blend: A rough-leafed tea of chestnut hue,
sparkling with silver motes. Has a delightful yet elusive
aroma reminiscent of high summer. If drunk: Elicits a
pleasant reverie filled with daydreams of youth and home.
If smoked while resting (no other activities for 1 hour),
heals 1 HP. Snobble’s Blend is abhorrent to mogglewomps
(DMB), driving them to instantly flee a building.
16. Sprite Fancies: Dainty square cakes, frosted with
congealed dreams. Smell of honey and hypnagogia. If
eaten: The subject gains a limited form of invisibility,
only active while they speak or sing. As long as the subject
makes clearly audible sound, they appear as shimmering
and semi-visible (+2 AC). The effect wears off after 6 Turns.
17. Sticky Gilly: Long, moist fronds of sticky, green pipeleaf.
Reeks of pondweed. The smoke is thick, green, and tends
to form piscine faces. If smoked: Rudimentary gills sprout
on the subject’s neck, granting the ability to breathe water
for short periods (at most 2 consecutive Turns, followed by
at least 2 Turns of breathing air). The gills disappear after
1d6 hours.
18. Tarts of Amicability: Dainty baked tarts with a delightful almond glaze, topped with a glacé cherry. If eaten: The
subject must Save Versus Spell or be enchanted to view
the one who bestowed the tart as a trusted friend. The
enchantment lasts for 1d6 Turns, but is otherwise treated
as the arcane spell Ingratiate.
19. Wanton Wisp: A fine, supple pipeleaf of sparkling,
golden hue, cultivated in Fairy. Produces coils and spirals of
violet smoke, smelling of rosemary and peach. If smoked:
Brings on a playful, frolicsome mood. Benignly smiling
faces coalesce in the swirling smoke and entertain smokers
with absurd songs and jokes in Sylvan.
20. Wyrm-Leaf: A coarse pipeleaf of deep purple hue, with
strands that writhe slowly when exposed to air. Hisses and
produces thick, coiling smoke. If smoked: The smoker can
exhale a blast of violet flame in a cone 15′ long, 10′ wide at
the end. All in the cone suffer 1d10 damage (Save Versus
Blast for half damage). Blasting fire consumes the portion
of Wyrm-Leaf.

Rare Fungi

1. Angel’s Lament: A fungus formed of hollow chimneys of
shining, golden hue. Smells of wet wool and has a taste akin
to intense horseradish, painfully attacking the sinuses.
If eaten: Addles the mind. The subject loses 1d6 points
of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma for 2d12 hours. A
successful Save Versus Doom reduces the loss by half. If
any score goes below 1, death results.
2. Bloodcap: Dainty little amber-coloured mushrooms
with a pointed cap. Their odour is reminiscent of bad blue
cheese and they have an oily taste. If eaten: Increases blood
pressure and heart rate for 24 hours. In stimulating situations (e.g. combat), the subject must Save Versus Doom or
faint for 1d6 Rounds.
3. Devil’s Grease: A slime-mould that gathers in cracks in
trees. It is jet black in colour, with an aura of ultraviolet.
Its odour is like off sausage and it tastes of goose grease. If
eaten: The subject becomes intensely aware of their own
physicality and animalistic nature for 1d6 hours—a highly
pleasurable experience. They must Save Versus Spell or be
overwhelmed by a primordial beast spirit, behaving like
an animal for the duration. Afterwards, the character’s
Constitution is reduced by 1d4 for a week.
4. Foolscap: Cream-coloured mushrooms with large,
floppy caps, flecked with orange. Smell distinctly of cloves

428

and taste earthy. If eaten: The subject must Save Versus
Doom or undergo a lycanthropic transformation into a
werewolf (DMB) over the space of 2d4 Rounds. The subject
remains in were-form until dawn.
5. Goatman’s Goblet: Miniature, orange, goblet-shaped
fungi that sprout from fuzzy patches on rotting wood.
Smell of goat’s milk and taste like blood. If eaten: Causes a
state of merry disorientation and restless leaping, lasting
for 1d4 hours. After each use of the fungus, the subject’s
facial hair noticeably increases. Frequent users of Goatman’s Goblet are exceptionally hirsute.
6. Grinning Jenny: Drab, olive capped toadstools whose
rims tend to curl up like leering grins. If eaten: Provides a
rush of energy, giving a +1 bonus to Attack Rolls, Damage
Rolls, and Saving Throws for 3d6 Turns. After the original
effect subsides, a state of complete catatonia sets in for
1d10 Turns.
7. Hob’s Lewd: Towering, horn-like nodules of slimy black
fungus. The slime, if collected when fresh, is sweet-tasting
and highly psychoactive. Hob’s Lewd is feared for its role
in folktales, wherein it is said to flourish at sites where
goblins have cavorted. If drunk: A pint of the fungus’
slime, guzzled down, brings on a state of energetic jubilation and wild cavorting lasting for 2d6 hours. Afterwards,
the subject must sleep for 24 hours straight or suffer a –2
penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

8. Lambent Stinkhorn: 8″ fungi with a long, fleshy stem
topped with a pink, lattice-like veil. Reek of stale urine
but are virtually flavourless. In darkness, lambent stinkhorns produce a faint, blue luminescence. If eaten: The
subject’s appetite is noticeably diminished, until 2 weeks
later a profusion of tiny stinkhorns erupt on their face
overnight. Unless removed by magic (e.g. Cure Affliction),
the fungi form a permanent, symbiotic growth, increasing
the subject’s maximum Hit Points by 1 and incurring a –1
penalty to Reaction Rolls (see Encounters, DPB)—except
with those who do not find fungal infestations disconcerting (e.g. mosslings).
9. Lover’s Gasp: Tiny pink mushrooms with delicate,
pointed caps and long, stringy stems. Have a faintly floral
odour and taste of sand. If eaten: A handful grants a +1
bonus to Charisma with respect to a single, specific individual, who must be visualised while the portion of mushrooms is slowly consumed.
10. Mawbarg’s Jam: A frothy, grey sludge that reeks of
awful cheese and tastes worse. If rubbed on wounds:
Heals 1d4 Hit Points. If eaten: The subject must Save
Versus Doom or vomit up the offensive “jam,” wasting
the portion. Those who manage to keep it down become
weightless for 1d6 Turns.
11. Mossmulch: Dark green, drooping fungi covered in
seaweed-like tendrils. If eaten: All parts of this fungus are
poisonous, causing abnormal thirst, visual distortions,
and delirium: –2 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
After 2d4 Turns, the subject must Save Versus Doom or
become comatose for 1d6 days.
12. Mottlecap: Wide-capped toadstools of mottled green/
brown colouration. Have an unpleasant odour akin to
cat’s urine. If eaten: Brings on a pounding headache for
24 hours. The subject must Save Versus Doom or be unable
to sleep, due to the throbbing pain. During this period, the
subject suffers a –2 penalty to Saving Throws against effects
of magical origin and perceives unnerving whisperings
from afar.
13. Numblings: Slimy, scarlet fungus bearing an eerie
resemblance to various bodily organs, including (1d6):
14. brain, 2. heart, 3. eyeball, 4. tongue, 5. finger, 6. nose. If
eaten: A character who consumes one of the organ-like
fungi will, after 1d6 days, grow an organ of the appropriate type. Organs lost to disease or damage may thus be
restored, or grotesque duplicate organs sprouted.
15. Puck’s Ear: Glistening black, ear-shaped fungi that grow
on bark. Smell of vinegar but taste fruity. If eaten: Causes
a listless trance lasting 1d4 hours. If a Save Versus Doom
fails, the subject is mentally assailed by 1d3 sprites (DMB).
The sprites are semi-imaginary, but malicious and quite
capable of harming the character.
16. Purple Nightcap: A deep purple fungus with long stems
and tiny button caps. Smells of milk and has a yeasty
flavour. If eaten: Causes a distressing shortness of breath.
After 1 Turn, the subject must Save Versus Doom or die of
asphyxiation. On a successful save, the subject falls into a
coma for 1d4 days. During the coma, there is a 50% chance
of a bodily appendage dying.

Identifying Species
The species listed here are considered unusual and
cannot be automatically identified by PCs. Players may
decide to collect specimens, investigate them further,
or even dare to try eating them.
Initially, only the physical characteristics (i.e. colour,
form, smell, etc.) of foraged specimens should be
described to the players. In time, players may come to
recognise certain species by their description and learn
their names from herbalists.

Locations of Common Fungi (DPB)
Blood Canker (1405, 1705), Grue's Ear (1003), Hogscap
(1011), Smottlebread (0809), Tom-a-Merry (1212), Witch's
Oyster (1109).
16. Rotting Mazegill: Densely packed balls of fibres that
appear to be of purple or orange hue, depending on the
viewing angle. The fungi smell of rotten parsnips and
taste of lime sorbet. If eaten: Causes weakness and heart
palpitations. After 1d4 Turns, the subject loses 3d6 Constitution—Save Versus Doom for half. If Constitution goes
below 1, death results. Lost Constitution returns at a rate of
1 point per day of complete rest. Until all lost Constitution
is recovered, the subject suffers a –2 Attack penalty, due
to weakness.
17. Shaggy Sage: A tiny, yellow fungus that grows in frothing clumps. Reeks of pungent spice and tastes of aniseed.
If eaten: Elicits a deep, hypnotic sleep lasting 2d3 hours,
wherein the subject dreams of an otherworldly paradise.
Upon awakening, the subject must Save Versus Spell or
become obsessed with the quixotic quest of finding this
obscure realm (or at least of eating Shaggy Sage again). If
awakened prematurely, part of the dreamer’s soul is lost
in this far realm—permanently lose 1 Wisdom.
18. Speckled Sporange: White puffballs, flecked with gold.
Odourless, but have a very strong citrus flavour. If eaten:
2-in-6 chance of granting a permanent +1 Constitution.
Otherwise causes a permanent –1 Strength and Constitution.
19. Velvet Flounder: Luxuriant, purple mushrooms
covered in swirling crimson patterns. If eaten: Engenders
a raging blood-lust, causing the subject to attack friend and
foe alike. Lasts for 1d3 Turns.
20. Witch’s Purple: Big, floppy bracket fungus of deep
purple hue and woody consistency. The fungi smell of fine
wine and taste of aniseed. If eaten: Brings on a psychedelic
state wherein all things appear purple-hued and eyes seem
to quadruple in size. The subject’s skin takes on a violet
hue for 1d4 days.

Rare Herbs

1. Black Clover: The milk-white leaves of a climbing vine
that turn black when dried. If eaten: Mildly poisonous:
Save Versus Doom or suffer 1 damage per Turn for the next
1d4 Turns. If smoked: Smoking dried leaves grants the
ability to speak with inanimate objects for 6 Turns. Most
conversations of this kind are hallucinatory nonsense, but
the Referee may also allow nuggets of useful information
to be gleaned.
2. Blushing Mandrake: Spindly, 1′-long, roughly humanoid
roots, covered in wiry, purple hairs. Blushing Mandrake
roots turn a bright scarlet hue within 5 minutes of being
unearthed. They reek of garlicky sweat. If eaten: The bitter,
oozing flesh has no effect. If boiled: If boiled and the resulting liquid consumed, causes a brief but intense heating of
the blood and flushing of the skin—Save Versus Doom
or faint for 1d6 Turns. Over the following 1d4 weeks, the
subject’s physical form changes in any way desired, within
the normal parameters of their Kindred. Weight, height,
skin, hair, sex, etc. may all be permanently altered.
3. Frondhelm: A striated green and yellow moss, with a
dank aroma. Each frond is tipped with a tiny, hand-like
furl. If eaten: For 1d6 Turns, the subject gains an invisible,
quasi-real extra hand that can be directed to manipulate
small objects up to 10′ distant. It can carry and manipulate
objects weighing up to 100 coins.

430

4. Goatsweed: Ungainly crowns of long, rough-furred
leaves that grow upon tree branches. If burned: Produces a
thick, roiling smoke that smells of roast pork. All goats and
related creatures (including breggles and those of breggle ancestry) within 10′ of the burning Goatsweed must
Save Versus Doom or caper uncontrollably for 1d4 Rounds,
unable to move, attack, or perform any other actions. A
portion of Goatsweed burns for 4 Rounds.
5. Groaning Mandrake: Hand-sized, roughly humanoid
roots, with long, straggly arms and wispy fingers. Black on
the outside, with rich green flesh. The roots briefly emit a
plaintive groaning, when unearthed. If eaten: The subject
must Save Versus Hold or transform into the last plant or
creature they ate for 1d3 hours. For example, if they dined
on roast beef, they become a cow; if they snacked on a
bread roll, they become a patch of wheat; and so on.
6. Hag’s Tears: The teardrop-shaped leaves of a marsh
succulent, olive green and scaly on the outside, pink and
juicy on the inside. Extremely bitter. If eaten: Enhances
hearing for 3d4 Turns. The subject gains a +1 bonus to
Listen, but loud sounds (e.g. combat) incur a –1 Attack and
Armour Class penalty for 1 Turn.
7. Horridwort: A violet marsh lichen with a musty odour
and an awfully bitter flavour. If eaten: Has no effect. If
smoked: An arcane spell-caster who smokes a pipe of dried
Horridwort in peace (2 Turns) has a 50% chance once a day
of being able to recall to memory a single spell that they

P a r t S e v e n | T r e a s u r e s a n d Odd m e n t s

cast within the last hour. The maximum Rank of spell that
can be recalled depends on the subject’s Level: a caster of
Level 1–4 may recall a Rank 1 spell, Level 5–9 a Rank 1–2
spell, and 10+ a Rank 1–3 spell.
8. Knobbled Mandrake: Hand-sized roots, broadly humanoid in form, covered in knobbly protrusions alike to extra
heads. When plucked from the earth, knobbled mandrake
roots squirm gently, sigh, then go still. They have a plumlike odour and taste of dung. If eaten: A missing bodily
appendage begins to regrow. A small appendage (e.g. a
finger) regrows 1 week after consuming the mandrake.
Full restoration of larger appendages requires additional
portions of Knobbled Mandrake: 2 portions and 2 weeks for
a hand, 4 portions and 4 weeks for an arm or leg.
9. Mind-Moss: Glistening purple moss spattered with
points of scintillating light. Smells of fresh dew and tastes
of elderberries. If eaten: Has the capacity to restore memories lost due to magic or old age. A subject under the effects
of a curse of delusion or amnesia may Save Versus Spell to
shake off the affliction.
10. Oddy Sorrel: Long, lank leaves with purple spots. Taste
of awfully strong vinegar. If eaten: The subject must Save
Versus Doom or forget everything that occurred in the
last 3d6 days.
11. Parson’s Gobble: Purple stem nodules of a lanky woodland flower. Taste at once horribly sweet and horribly
bitter. If eaten: The subject’s need for sleep is eradicated
for 24 hours. If consumed repeatedly, causes the subject’s
teeth to blacken and rot.
12. Prancing Mandrake: 1′-long roots with lanky, humanlike legs and arms and bulbous heads. The roots’ legs
wobble and jig when unearthed, and their faces smirk
and grimace. Smell of wild garlic and taste of goose fat.
If eaten: Brings about a wooziness and lightness of head
within 1 Turn. The subject must Save Versus Doom or fall
deeply unconscious for 2d12 hours. If the save succeeds,
the subject remains conscious but suffers a –2 penalty to
Attack Rolls and Saving Throws for 1d8 hours.
13. Rindlewort: Long, finger-like roots that scrabble at the
soil when unearthed. Smell of dung and taste horribly
bitter. If boiled: The roots dissolve, producing a viscous,
steel-grey liquid that can be used as an ink (sufficient for
4 pages of text). Text in Rindlewort ink can only be read by
the character who wrote it and optionally one other person
named while writing.
14. Sage Toe: Toe-like root nodules of a gnarled bog willow,
dug up and smoke-dried. If chewed: Grants the ability to
absorb written information at a greatly accelerated rate.
The subject can get the gist of a book on a quick flip through
(1 Turn) and can fully absorb the contents in 6 Turns. The
effects last for 2d6 Turns, during which time the character
is unable to communicate lucidly.
15. Sclubber’s Twist: A fuzzy, lilac moss that grows in the
upper branches of unusually large trees (150′ tall or more).
The moss has a faint, earthy odour. If chewed, it exudes a
juice that tastes like cherry wine. If chewed: The subject
enters a trance state for 1d6 Turns. Fairies and demi-fey
experience a fantastic vision of the dawning of creation.
Mortals experience a harrowing nightmare of being torn
limb from limb by evil trees. If eaten: Brings on stomach

cramps and sickness. After 1d6 Turns, the subject must Save
Versus Doom or permanently lose 1 Constitution.
16. Shub Eggs: 6″ ovoid fruit sacs dangling by rubbery cords
from the twisted trees of the Nagwood. Each sac contains
a brain-like inner fruit in a succulent, pink jelly. When a
fruit is plucked, the brain-like interior pulses gently for an
hour, then goes still. If eaten: Each whole fruit consumed
heals 1 Hit Point. The subject must Save Versus Doom or be
cursed with a hunger for human flesh. Those who succumb
gradually turn into ogres (DMB).
17. Snogglebeard: A lichen-like moss that grows on rotting
wood in long, yellow or cyan beards. Odourless and flavourless. Unpleasantly dry, chewy, and stringy to eat. If eaten:
Blurs the subject’s mental aura for 1d6 Turns, enabling
them to read the thoughts of others within 5′. The subject’s
own thoughts also flow uncontrollably outwards and are
perceived by all within 10′.
18. Woodpurse: Pale, pouch-like leaves of a creeping shrub.
Acorns, water, or honey are sometimes found within the
pouches. The leaves are odourless and have a slightly
minty taste. If eaten: The subject becomes deathly pale
and partially transparent for 1d6 Turns. During this time,
they can physically interact with incorporeal creatures and
can harm them in combat even without magic.
19. Worm-Mallow: Stringy, pink roots of a flowering
shrub beloved by toads. Taste sweet and gooey. If eaten:
Induces instant sobriety and has a 3-in-6 chance of negating poisons.
20. Writhing Mandrake: 5″ roots with stubby limbs and
wolf-like heads. When unearthed, the root writhes around
as if in agony. Smell of dung. If eaten: The subject must
Save Versus Doom or immediately vomit the root back
up. Those who make the save experience intense grumbling of the digestive system for several hours, followed by
the vigorous growth of all body hair. Excess hair drops off
after 1 week. If boiled: The resulting liquid acts as a potion
preventing lycanthropic transformation for 1d4 days.

rumour is just a legend fresh out of the womb. At
least that’s what my granddad used to always say.
Full of tall tales that one was, and I never believed a
word. “Not proper,” is what my mum used to call them. Well,
proper or not, rumours ain’t always false whispering or idle
gossip. Neither rightly are they always true. They seem to have
a way of taking on a life of their own, if you ask me and live on
well past thems that started them. Most of all, they’re dangerous in the wrong ears. I suppose, in that respect, my dear old
departed granddad and saint of a mother, god rest their souls,
were both right.”

Pipes on Droomen Knoll
A short starter adventure to introduce players to the mysteries of Dolmenwood.

P

ipes on Droomen Knoll is a short introductory
adventure set in an ancient fairy ruin, now the
base of a band of crookhorns spying on a nearby
settlement.

Character Levels 1–2
This adventure is designed for PCs of Level 1–2. It makes a
great introduction to Dolmenwood for groups new to the
setting. A total of approximately 5,000gp worth of monetary treasure is present.

Location
Choose which settlement PCs will start in and locate this
adventure somewhere in the vicinity. For example, in
hex 0809 (near Lankshorn), hex 1111 (near Dreg), or hex
1206 (near Prigwort). The Referee may either require PCs
to travel to the adventure site or may start play as they
approach the site (Area 1).

Referee’s Background
Fairy Keep
Long ago, a fairy keep stood atop a hill in the erstwhile
mortal dominion of Prince Mallowheart (p34) in Dolmenwood. The prince and his frost elf courtiers visited the keep
upon occasion, gathering to feast and make merry. A small
series of dungeons housed prisoners for the entertainment
of the prince and his retinue.
As time turned in the mortal world and allegiances and
whims in Fairy shifted, the keep was eventually abandoned. After centuries, it fell into ruin and was forgotten.

Crookhorn Spies
In recent weeks, a band of crookhorns has taken up residence in the ruins, using them as a base of operations to
spy on the doings of local folk. They have instructions to
contact corrupt elements in the local constabulary and
learn of their secrets.

The Prisoner
When the keep was abandoned, one prisoner was left
behind—a treacherous frost elf named Famine-Whistles-Whither, whom Mallowheart condemned to eternal
incarceration in the mortal world. Trapped by magic, the
prisoner fell into a fitful reverie, lost to time and the world.

Pipes on Droomen Knoll
The crookhorns, exploring the dungeons beneath the
keep, awoke the prisoner from his reverie. He now hopes to
escape with the aid of mortals. Fashioning a set of panpipes

434

from the bones of dungeon vermin, his beautiful, enchanting music now echoes from the ruins. The crookhorns
mockingly accompany his piping with their own brash
melodies, but other mortals may be drawn near to aid the
prisoner.

Hooks

Select one or more of the following hooks to draw PCs into
the adventure. When selecting a hook, consider the interests and inclinations of the players and their characters.
For example, heroically inclined PCs may be drawn in by
the Missing Youth hook, whereas the Fairy Chalice hook
may appeal to those of a more mercenary persuasion.

Missing Youth
A local human youth of fanciful nature, named Arda
Vague, is missing and his family seeks the PCs’ aid in bringing him home. They report that he spent several nights
in the last week visiting Droomen Knoll, where he said
he heard enchanting music. The family fear he has been
kidnapped by fairies and provide PCs with a pair of cold
iron shortswords, in addition to directions to the knoll.
They offer PCs 200gp for the safe return of Arda.
In reality: Arda has been captured by the crookhorns lairing in the ruins on Droomen Knoll.

Crookhorn Sightings
Two humans of the local constabulary contact PCs with a
covert mission to aid the local settlement. Sergeant Marge
Bregson informs PCs of reports of crookhorns snooping
around the ruins atop Droomen Knoll. The settlement
leaders will pay 200gp to the party to scout out the knoll
and report back on any crookhorn activities. Marge’s
companion, constable Rodger Burl, clarifies that the
reports are probably nonsense.
In reality: The reports of the crookhorns are true. Rodger
Burl meets regularly with them at the settlement’s
outskirts at night. He and several other constables have
been corrupted by the crookhorns’ master, the Nag-Lord,
Atanuwë (p45).

The Fairy Chalice
PCs come into possession of a page from an old book
describing the ancient fairy keep atop Droomen Knoll. The
page describes a pellucidium chalice of great beauty (and,
presumably, material value) hidden within a magical pool
in a secret hall beneath the keep. The cryptic note “Fairy
ice and mortal blood” appears at the bottom of the page.
In reality: The page refers to Area 13, where the chalice can
indeed be found. The cryptic note refers to the means of
clearing the ice protecting the chalice.

Adventure Format
Dolmenwood adventures are written in a format that
makes them quick and easy to run with minimal prep.
Each adventure area is structured as follows.
Number and name: The number corresponds with the
map. The name helps to quickly orient the Referee as to
the area’s form or function.
Description: A highlighted block noting the main
descriptive elements obvious to PCs entering the
area. This is formatted as a series of bolded terms, each
followed by parentheses containing a little more detail.
Actions and details: Paragraphs beginning with a bold
label. These describe the possible results of actions the
PCs might take, or additional details pertaining to
certain conditions (e.g. directions, times of day).
Major features: Elements of an area that require a more
detailed individual description—for example creatures
inhabiting the area—are listed under separate headings, each with their own description and actions.

1. Approaching the Knoll
Forest hill (looms above treetops). Pale blue mallows
(underfoot). Slender silver birches (grow on slopes).

Cacophonous Music
Drifts from Ruined Keep (carried by breeze). Keening
pipes (thin, eerie). Drums and trumpet (raucous). Brash
cries (snatches of Gaffe).
Listening: The eerie pipe music conjures mournful visions
of Dolmenwood in deep winter.

Using the Format
1. Scan the area name and the headings of any major
features. This gives a high-level impression of the
area’s form, function, and the most important
features (including denizens).
2. Scan the descriptions, focusing on the bolded terms.
Describe the most important details to the players.
3. As players explore or ask questions about the area,
provide further details, for example the terms
listed in parentheses.
4. Refer to the listed actions and details as required,
based on PC actions. Improvise any PC actions not
covered—that is part of the fun of the game.

on end.

Epilogue

The adventure may have various repercussions, depending
on the PCs’ actions. Following are some possible threads
that the Referee may weave into the ongoing campaign.

The Prisoner Released
The frost elf Thinwhistle (Area 12), if freed, disappears
initially. However, he may reappear later in the campaign
as a vexing antagonist or occasional ally of the PCs.

Medium Fairy—Sentient—Chaotic

Local Spies

PCs may uncover the corruption in the local constabulary.
This could lead to intrigue and further adventures in the
local settlement, as PCs help uncover the corrupt elements
and bring them to justice.

Cold iron: Suffers 1 extra point of damage when hit with
cold iron weapons.
Magic resistance: +2 bonus to Saving Throws against
effects of magical origin.
Music: Maddening panpipe music directed at a chosen
target, who must Save Versus Spell or attack their allies
for 1 Round.

Atanuwë’s Interest Piqued
If PCs defeat the crookhorns at Droomen Knoll, word may
eventually get back to Atanuwë. Crookhorns and other
minions of the Nag-Lord may track the PCs down to exact
vengeance or to try to corrupt and recruit them.

Rumours
Tales which may be heard by the tavern fireside or on the lips of wandering bards.

F

olktales, rumours, and hearsay about weird
monsters, fabulous treasures, and political
intrigue flow freely wherever people gather. It is
recommended that the Referee relate one or two rumours
whenever characters spend time in an inn, tavern, or other
location where gossip is shared.
General rumours: The general rumours in this section
relate to topics that are discussed throughout Dolmenwood.
Settlement rumours: The rumours listed in the following
pages relate to the people, folktales, and immediate environs of the most important settlements in Dolmenwood.
These rumours are generally only heard within the settlement in question.
Monster rumours: The Dolmenwood Monster Book also
contains an appendix with rumours about the monsters
of Dolmenwood. These rumours may be sprinkled in to
taste or used when characters inquire about the folklore
surrounding specific monsters.

General Rumours

1. Ancient magic of Lake Longmere: Known colloquially as
“the Heart of the Wood,” the great lake Longmere is said to
be the seat of an ancient magic in Dolmenwood, guarded
by the witches. On moonlit nights, witches fly over the lake
and commune with water spirits, who whisper secrets that
others wish to hide. Partly true: The presence of the Wood
God Gheillough in the lake in ancient times is the source
of rumours about the powers of the lake. The witches have
no relation with Gheillough.
2. Be wary of the owls: The common folk of the Wood fear
owls of all kinds, for they are regarded as an omen of death.
Many a folk tale speaks of mortals who were driven mad by
the gaze of an owl or disappeared after encountering one
of the birds by surprise. It is perhaps no coincidence that
the chosen symbol of the Drune—found carved into rocks
and trees wherever they gather—is an owl in flight. Partly
true: Such rumours refer to witch owls (DMB). Normal owls
have no supernatural potency, as a rule.
3. Dewidort of Smerne: The phantom of this notorious
highwayman has haunted the roads of the Wood since the
village of his origin—situated in the wild moors north of
Dolmenwood—was submerged in the black ooze of the
ever-expanding bog. The secret location of his treasure
hoard is a topic of great interest to adventurers, rogues,
and the law alike. True.
4. Fairies in Prigwort: The jaded entourage of the evil fairy
Prince Mallowheart is said to visit the town of Prigwort at
night for secret congress with its council, the Brewmasters.
What dealings they have with the fairy Prince is unknown.
False: Though such rumours may originate in the Brewmasters’ secret alliance with the Earl of Yellow.
5. Longhorn rivalries: The half-brother longhorns Ramius
and Malbleat are bitter rivals, scheming to undermine
each other’s reputation and influence. Word in Lankshorn
is that both lords are amassing troops in secret and that
their animosity will soon erupt into open war. The Lankshorners fear that their town may be the stage upon which
the two armies clash. Partly true: The rivalry between
the half-brothers is well known, though neither currently
plans open warfare.
6. Master bladesmith in Lankshorn: The finest bladesmith
in Dolmenwood makes his home in Lankshorn. In addition
to normal swords of exquisite make, he sells weapons of
cold iron, which is harmful to fairies. True.
7. Relics in the ruined abbey: It is rumoured that the
Church has endeavoured on several occasions to re-sanctify the ruined abbey of St Clewyd, but to no avail, for the
place is said to be haunted. The riches of the former abbey
are believed to still lie untouched in its crypts. True.

440

P a r t E i g h t | App e n d i c e s

8. Rise of the talking beasts: The population of sapient
beasts in Dolmenwood is growing, especially in the northern valley now known as the “Valley of Wise Beasts.” It is
feared that some unknown force is rallying the talking
beasts, preparing to overrun the forest and wrest town and
bower from their rightful owners. False: The Valley of Wise
Beasts is home to many humanoid animals (Cobbins—
DMB), but they are not being rallied to take over Dolmenwood.
9. Sinister fogs in winter: Sometimes in the deeps of
winter, clouds of thick, sinister fog rise from the earth in
Dolmenwood. Ghosts, phantoms, and ghouls roam with
the fogs, ensuring that only the desperate venture out of
doors. These fogs—lasting for several days—are known as
Vagues. True.
10. Spies of the Cold Prince: There are reports of frostclad fairies upon the roads of Dolmenwood—undoubtedly
servants of the Cold Prince. It is claimed that these frigid
elves will trade icy jewels and fairy silver in exchange for
information about what goes on in the deep woods. True.
11. The dead in Dolmenwood: A curious property of
Dolmenwood is that the souls of those who die there retain
their connection to the corpse indefinitely. This is known,
in scriptural terms, as “mortalism” and is a phenomenon
of some dispute within the Pluritine Church. It is only
through the careful ministrations of the order of Saint
Signis the Silent (also known as the order of Lichwards)
that the dead are put to rest. False: The fate of deceased
souls is no different in Dolmenwood than elsewhere in
the wider world.
12. The dream thief: Folk in Castle Brackenwold speak of
recent nights of restless sleep in which they dream only of
drifting upon a vast body of purple water. This portends
the machinations of the fairy lord known as The Duke Who
Cherishes Dreams. It is said that he steals the dreams of
mortals and—with the aid of the sorceress Ygraine—plots
to drag Dolmenwood into his somnambulant domain.
False.
13. The Drunes’ vengeance: Red-eyed ravens and ghostly
owls have been spied congregating around graveyards.
This is an omen that the wrath of the Drune is turning
toward the Pluritine Church, in reprisal for the recent
attacks on the brotherhood by the witch-hunters of the
order of St Faxis. Partly true: The Church, under Bishop
Sanguine, has turned its attentions toward rooting out
the Drune of late, but the purported omens are fictitious.

14. The Hag’s eye: Those who venture into the stinking
marshes north of the village of Dreg speak in fearful tones
of the Hag, an ancient and terrible sorceress who haunts
the region. According to legend, bold Sir Hankley skewered
her left eye upon his lance and cast the horrid organ into
the bog. The Hag promptly devoured the impudent and
ill-fated knight, but searches to this day for her lost eye. She
would be greatly indebted to one who could locate it. False.
15. The Nag-Lord moves south: Crookhorns have been
sighted in the vicinity of the ruined abbey of St Clewyd of
late, far to the south of their master’s dominion. The folk
of Prigwort mutter fearfully of war. Word has it that the
duke’s forces are massing in the town in anticipation of
an attack. True.
16. The wizard of Prigwort: A magician by the name of
Droobe makes his home within the town of Prigwort. It
is said that he is amenable to visitors seeking his arcane
knowledge and is willing to place or lift curses for a fee. It is
believed that his magic is responsible for the otherworldly
quality of the spirits brewed in Prigwort. Partly true: His
name is Drouge and he has no involvement with the distilleries of Prigwort. He also cannot place or lift curses, but
does offer other magical services.
17. Treasures of Hoarblight Keep: Anglers and hunters
who ply the western shores of Lake Longmere speak of
Hoarblight Keep: a pale white keep atop the cliffs. This is
the accursed palace of the fairy Cold Prince, lain in ruins
for many centuries, shrouded with fearsome wards and
bans to protect the earthly hoard of the Cold Prince which
still lies untouched in its catacombs. True.
18. Treasures of the Big Chook: Fishers’ tales abound with
accounts of the lake monster Big Chook which haunts the
waters of Lake Longmere and metes out horrific death
to all who encounter it. The beast is said to slumber in a
crystal cavern deep in the lake, where it guards a hoard of
fabulous treasures, including the long lost mirror of the
Queen of the Witches—a magical doorway to the realm of
the witches’ dark gods. Partly true: Big Chook does lair in
an aquatic cavern (hex 0606), but its treasure hoard does
not contain the described (imaginary) artefact.
19. Weird fungi in Mulchgrove: A profusion of valuable
fungi, some of which are magical, can be found in Mulchgrove. Witches and herbalists will pay good money for rare
specimens. True.

20. The dukes’ sinister pact: In ancient times, the Dukes of
Brackenwold made pact with the secret gods of the Wood,
being granted rulership over all of Dolmenwood for fortyfour generations, in exchange for their souls after death.
This time span has almost expired and it is surmised that
ruin will soon befall the duke and his family. False: Though
this rumour may have its origin in the pact made with the
entity in the Oubliette (see p130).

Rumours in Blackeswell

1. Aster’s mannequin: The village tailor, Sylvain Aster, is
in love with a bejewelled mannequin, which he keeps in
his private chambers. False.
2. Fungal brain: Mosslings worship a giant fungal brain in
the toadstool woods to the south-east (1505). True.
3. Fairy music: Otherworldly music drifts through the bogs
to the north-east (1704), emanating from a magical portal
to the fairy realm of Whyforth. Partly true: The presence
of the music is correct, but its source is misconstrued.
4. Golden apples: A tree bearing golden apples stands
by a putrid pool north along Armsheath’s Road. An evil
hag guards the tree, and only parts with an apple if fed
the still-beating heart of a priest. Partly true: The site is
correctly noted, but the hag’s desires are pure speculation.

5. Crooked smuggler: The proprietor of the Crooked Arm,
Arbie Snyde, has been seen hanging around derelict buildings at night. She’s been taking advantage of the numerous
abandoned buildings as part of an elaborate smuggling
operation. Partly true: Snyde is lurking around the village’s
derelict buildings to look for treasure, not hide it.
6. Burial mounds: Scores of ancient barrows are scattered throughout the boggy landscape to the north-west
(1504). Many are still unlooted, though those that remain
untouched are protected by traps and guardians. True.
7. Golden beetles: An overgrown shrine is hidden deep in
the toadstool forest to the west (1505); however, swarms of
golden beetles attack all who venture too near. Partly true:
The presence of the shrine is correct, but the holy beetles
only attack those infested with the Myconom’s spores.

8. Healing slime: The sticky, orange slime that drips from
the giant fungi to the south (1605) has powers of healing
if consumed. True.

6. Cheese gardens: A retired mossling warrior lives in a
manor to the east (1804) where she tends to magnificent
gardens of fungal cheese. Some of these cheeses have magical properties. True.

7. Lepers’ whiskey: A colony of lepers lurks in the bogs
north of Follyegg Road (1603). They brew a potent whiskey
strong enough to rouse the dead. Partly true: The brewers
are undead, not lepers.

7. Secret partnership: Father Bertil is secretly in league
with the mysterious Mr Klepp, despite his protestations.
Why else has the vicar been so frequently spotted near the
out-of-towner’s workshop? False.

8. Mine reopening: A mysterious Mr Klepp from the big
city has been buying up property in Blackeswell. He plans
to reopen the mine, extending the ancient tunnels with
modern machinery to open up new veins of Hag Iron.
Partly true: Mr Klepp has indeed bought property in Blackeswell, but does not intend to pursue mining.

8. The hungry willow: Following streams and the sound
of moaning in the south-east leads to a grove of willows
(1805). One of these ancient trees is intelligent and willing
to trade secrets in exchange for sufficient sacrifices. True.

9. Necromancer’s tomb: An evil magician lies entombed
in the bog to the north-east (1504). On nights of the full
moon, her fell spirit rises and commands the corpses of
the surrounding barrows to roam abroad. False: Though
the presence of haunted barrows is correct.
9. Singing stinkhorns: Giant mushrooms in the fungal
woods to the south-east (1705) sing lullabies praising St
Jorrael. True.
10. The gaunt sorcerer: The sorcerer Brainfogle haunts a
stone circle north of Follyegg Road (1603), studying ancient
lore by the light of a blazing torch. He wields the secrets of
death and eternal life, which he is willing to share with any
who can defeat his skeletal minions. Partly true: The location of the stones is correct, but the nature of the sorcerer
is misconstrued (he is the Audrune Mathonwy).
11. The King of all Woodgrues: Mighty King Ogglewoop—
ruler of all goblin-kind in the mortal world—holds court
in the bogs to the north-east (1704). The king plots to bring
Blackeswell under his dominion, replacing the village
council with a goblin baron. Partly true: The identity of
the king and the location of his court are correct. His plot
to take over Blackeswell is pure speculation.
12. Fungal shortcut: Following the fungal chasm to the
south of Blackeswell (1605) provides a straightforward and
relatively safe route directly south. True.
13. Slumbering frog: The peculiar state of the Blacke is due
to an enormous frog that lies in perpetual slumber at the
very bottom of the pool. The toad-children sometimes
seen wandering about are its spawn. False.

442

20. Rogue animals: Past the fungal woods to the southeast are bramble thickets infested with thieving rodents
(1706). These animals have been trained to steal and hoard
treasures on behalf of a fairy prince. Partly true: The presence of thieving animals is correct, but they were actually
taught to steal by some of the mossling families in the hex.

Rumours in Castle
Brackenwold

1. Patriarch’s shadow: Although Duke Thespian is a fair
ruler, he has yet to live up to the standard set by his war
hero father, Duke Argibald IV. Even at sixty years of age, his
people await an action or crisis that will define his legacy.
True.
2. Fairy ancestry: The Dukes of Brackenwold have fairy
ancestry, with their forebears courting the elf nobles who
helped build Castle Brackenwold in days of yore. False: Elf
nobles did build the original castle, but this was long before
the people of Brackenwold arrived in Dolmenwood.
3. Familial curse: The Duke’s first-born daughter, Persimone, perished when she was young. This was yet another
death in a generational curse that has claimed the life of
each first-born daughter of the dukes in the Brackenwold
line. False: There is no curse; rather, the Duke sacrificed
his daughter as part of an ancient pact.
4. The Duke’s tourney: Every midsummer, Brackenwold
holds a great tourney where Dolmenwood’s best demonstrate their skill at arms. Most famous, however, is the
hunting contest, whose winner is a guest of the Duke for
a night. True.
5. The Shadow House: The city’s only commercial guild
of magicians, the Shadow House offers spell-craft and
enchantment. The guildmistress, Lady Periwinkle, appears
in her 20s but has already lived countless other lives. Partly
true: She actually appears younger than her true age due
to the powers of her magic mirror.
6. The bishop’s obsession: Bishop Jospher Sanguine is
infamous for his hatred of unsanctioned practitioners of
arcane magic, only increasing as he’s aged. He now desires
nothing more than to utterly purge Dolmenwood of the
Drune and the witches. True.
7. Witch blackmail: Sanctus Primus sent clerics of St Faxis
to slay a witch near the Whispering Caves (1606). She was
blackmailing Primus, though no one knows what about.
Partly true: The witch survived as well and is now hiding
in the Chestnut Dell (1707).
8. Kingly barrows: A mile south of the city is Monarch’s
Hill (1508), topped by twelve barrows and a granite obelisk.
The oldest barrow is guarded by an ancient spirit who
demands proof of nobility before giving access to the treasures within. Partly true: The spirit requests the sigil of the
fairy Duke Mai-Fleur and guards a Fairy Door.
9. Henchgate: A gateway of arched trees on the way into
Dolmenwood, known as the Henchgate (1407), famously
gives well wishes to those passing beneath it. The gate was
formed long ago, when human knights slew the forest’s
false wooden gods and fashioned their bodies into the
gate. False: The provenance of the henchgate is unknown
but seemingly natural.

10. Cragwardens: An enormous stone crag to the west
(1408) is guarded by a militia known as the Order of Cragwardens. In times of war, the militia commands ancient
ritual magic that can cause the crag to rise out of the
ground, revealing a stone titan to defend the Tithelands.
False: The crag and its wardens are real, but they have no
such power.
12. Stinking mausoleum: A party of grievously injured
tomb raiders recently returned from an expedition to a
rotting mausoleum in the woods to the south-west (1409).
They spoke of unlooted treasure, but also an undead amalgamation of maggot-filled corpses. True.
13. Singing spring: In the wetlands to the south-west (1410)
is a magical spring that grants a beautiful singing voice to
any who drink from it, even animals. It can be found by
following melodies drifting on the wind. True.
14. Wandering friars: A group of twelve friars in black
robes wander the woods to the north-east (1607). Travellers avoid them, fearing they are malicious fairy bandits.
Partly true: The friars are restless spirits, here to test the
character of others.
15. Secret tunnels: The Frolicke, the Duke’s personal woodland, is full of ornate statues that conceal secret passageways leading throughout the city. Nobles use them for
clandestine meetings and illicit affairs. Partly true: There
is at least one, which leads to the Bitter Rose’s cellars.
16. Black magic: The Royal Institute of Physicks and Sorcerers is dogged by accusations of black magic and demon
summoning, despite protestations from college head and
divination master Edwynne Woglemain. True: Beneath
the institute, forbidden magicks have trapped a demon.
17. Den of thieves: The Poppy Cock inn is infamous for the
low morals of its clientele, making it the perfect place to
meet rogues or mercenaries. Castle Brackenwold’s thieves’
guild isn’t based out of the inn, but its members can be
found there. True.
18. Crookhorn war: The Order of St Sedge has been mustering defensive fortifications near Prigwort (1106), meaning
war against the crookhorns is imminent. Partly true: The
likelihood of war is high, but not inevitable just yet.
19. Healing crystals: A couple of days’ travel to the west
is Fog Lake, surrounded by wondrous crystal caves (1207).
These underground chambers contain russet crystals with
remarkable curative properties. False: Though the crystal
caves exist, their crystals do not have any healing powers.
20. Excavations: Two archaeological expeditions have left
Castle Brackenwold recently. Sage Archibald Helmwhit’s
went north to the Table Downs (1201) to unearth ancient
civilisations, while magician Peligrue the Perspicuous’
went east to unearth a giant skeleton (1806). True.

21. Fairy rumours: Shankswell Cross (1509), to the south
of the city, is a farmers’ market famed as a local hotspot
of gossip. Many of the rumours are whispered by invisible sprites who live in the hedge rows. Partly true: The
market is a source of rumours, but they’re all invented by
the Atacorn living in a cave at the bottom of the well.

Rumours in Cobton-onthe-Shiver

1. The Baron: As the Nag-Lord’s representative in the Valley
of the Wise Beasts, Baron Fragglehorn is a holy man, with
great spiritual powers. False: Fragglehorn isn’t holy, nor
does he have any supernatural powers.
2. Nag-Lord of Creation: The Cobbins, the Valley, and
everything else in the world were brought into existence by the Nag-Lord, master of all creation. Partly true:
Atanuwë is responsible for awakening sentience in the
Cobbins.
3. Omnipresence: The Nag-Lord’s power is absolute. He
knows the whereabouts and deeds of everyone in the
Valley at all times. Despite this, he sometimes does not
expose crimes and blasphemy, for secret reasons of his
own. False.
4. The Grey League: A blasphemous plot is being hatched
in whispers, with the ultimate goal of expelling all crookhorns from Cobton and overthrowing Baron Fragglehorn.
The corpses of three hares hang in the village square, sending a pointed message about the effectiveness of rebellion.
True.
5. No leaving the valley: It is illegal on pain of death for a
Cobbin to leave the Valley, as the realms beyond are sacred
lands where only the Nag-Lord and his chosen servants
may roam. Hackle Kingsley tried to leave, and now he’s in
the gaol awaiting trial. Partly true: The world beyond the
Valley is not sacred.
6. Rats: Someone in Cobton has been feeding information
on their fellows to the guard captain, Briggsy Bugber, but
no one knows who. True: The spies are the mouse millers,
charmed by a harpy.
7. Enthralled: The mouse millers have been out of sorts
lately, often staring vacantly at nothing. Doctor Simeone
Fisher wants to create a herbal cure for them, though the
millers have rebuffed his concerns. Partly true: Fisher is
correct that there is something wrong with the mice but
does not realise it has a magical cause.
8. Baron Fragglehorn’s Tower: Baron Fragglehorn’s
warped tower sits in the centre of the valley, a base of operations and garrison from which crookhorns are sent out
on patrol. True.
9. The egg: A mile west of Cobton is a farmstead nursing
a 7′ wide egg. A serpent-unicorn grows inside, a blessing
sent by the Nag-Lord. False: The egg contains a giant black
cygnet, sent to fight Chaos in Dolmenwood.
10. Fugitives: Two hardened criminals, the crookhorn
Scruff and the polecat Stripe, recently escaped from the
stockade in Cobton and fled east towards Longshanks Falls
(1203). They are armed and extremely dangerous. Partly
true: Both are fugitives from the Baron, but they are not
dangerous.
11. The Elder Willows: A cluster of seven colossal willow
trees sit atop Longshanks Falls (1203). Known to locals as
the Elder Willows, their roots stretch the entire height of
the Valley. True.

444

12. Black slime: A sickly black slime sometimes leaks down
the north side of the Valley from somewhere above (1003).
It’s a reminder of the dangers outside the Valley, and touching it physically stains your hands with sin. False: The
slime has no moral aspect.
13. Singing trees: From beyond the eastern end of the
Valley (1303) comes the sounds of sonorous melodies,
animals singing, and other strange but beautiful noises.
No one knows who or what is causing them. True.
14. Hermitage: A huge, hairless mouse lives alone atop
the far south-western end of the Valley (0905). Only ever
glimpsed from a distance, there’s been no sight of him in
some time. Partly true: The hairless mouse was a human
friar, since murdered by a mogglewomp.
15. Gelatinous punishment: Translucent, jelly-like
animals live amongst the willow trees in the far east (1203).
They were once like other Cobbins, until the Nag-Lord
revoked their ability to talk and think as a punishment for
their blasphemy. False: The jelly-like animals in question
are simply gelatinous apes.
16. Mouse shrine: An adventurous Cobbin who visited a
strange church in the Valley’s far west (0905) returned
with reports of a strange statue surrounded by carved
mice. Some mouse Cobbins secretly speculate that mousekind was created by the being depicted by this idol, not the
Nag-Lord. False: What the Cobbin found was a shrine to St
Vinicus, patron saint of beggars and mice.
17. Runaway badgers: Three badgers named Vannard, Ivol,
and Segwine attempted to escape out of the eastern end of
the Valley decades ago. They were never heard from again,
but given that their corpses weren’t paraded through the
streets of Cobton, sympathetic Cobbins still hold out hope
they were successful. True: The escapees did survive,
making it to Hoglyn’s Spire (1904).
18. Holy bones: The crookhorns have been overheard talking in strange jeering tones of searching for “holy people
bones” for the Nag-Lord’s “collection.” True.
19. Ophidiophobia: Baron Fragglehorn once jumped and
screamed at the sight of a normal adder. He bludgeoned
the only crookhorn witness to death in anger, but a Cobbin
witnessed the entire thing from hiding. True.
20. Watchers: Sometimes, strange figures in dark cloaks
are spotted standing atop the Valley’s ridge, surveying
everything below in silence. True: Specifically, these
figures are Drune.

Rumours in Dreg and
Shantywood Isle

1. Fungal manor: The reclusive Lady Mulbreck, in her
grief at the loss of her husband, has let Bogwitt Manor
(1210) run to ruin. The place is now so blanketed in eerie
fungus that it’s difficult to find the entrance. Partly true:
The description of the manor is accurate, but the cause of
Lady Mulbreck’s seclusion is not.
2. Haunted stones: Avoid the accursed glades around
Brydging Ring (1011), by the edge of the forest to the southwest, where wraiths lurk. True.
3. Hogbeard’s zealots: Brother Hogbeard’s manner has
gotten ever more fiery of late. Reverend Mother Hadlewreath wants nothing more to do with him and his vigilante gang. True.
4. Incestuous magicians: Avoid the old watermill up north
along the Hameth (1110). A brother and sister—magicians
both—live there as incestuous husband and wife, entertaining sinister guests from Fairy. Partly true: The brother
and sister are actually two guises of a single person.
5. Island of the frogs: A mysterious, fog-shrouded island
drifts in the swamp to the north (1109). It is home to a frogheaded sorceress whose hypnotic gaze can cure magical
afflictions. Partly true: The presence of the drifting island
is correct, but a sorceress does not dwell there.
6. Lights in the inn: The Mermaid’s Arms is haunted by the
spirit of old Mrs Tweede (the former landlady). At night,
guests report seeing weird lights and noxious mists drifting from a secret attic room. Partly true: The lights and
vapours originate in the attic laboratory of Tamrin Tweede,
the current proprietor.

7. Shantywood password: If you row to the north cove on
Shantywood Isle and present a white rose, you’ll be granted
free entry to the Chateau for one night. False.
8. The Berkmaster’s wicked scheme: Berkmaster Monocleese is in league with witches and plans to sacrifice his
wife to their evil deity. He must be stopped before it’s too
late! False: This is a fabrication of the haunted dreams of
Brigg Meagre, leader of the Boghouse Boys.
9. The Grey Blight: Wretched victims of the Hag wander
aimlessly in the woods to the north-east (1009), stripped
of their souls and drained of all colour. They can only be
cured by merriment, music, and wine. Partly true: The
presence of such unfortunates is true, but the source and
cure of their affliction are unfounded.
10. The mushroom stone: An ancient, mushroom-covered
standing stone of great occult potency lies to the south of
the Ditchway (0910). It is jealously guarded by a sorcerer
who is a master of slimes and fungi. Partly true: The nature
of the warden is misconstrued.
11. The river troll: Ships travelling over the wondrous
conveyor at the Falls of Nyf (1112) fear the presence of a vile
river troll who drags sailors from their ships and smashes
their skulls on the riverbed. The toll wardens would pay a
hefty ransom to any who could kill this monster. Partly
true: The wardens have come to an agreement with the
troll, who no longer attacks ships.
12. The sleeping sword: An enchanted sword hangs in the
halls of Ferneddbole House (1209). Any struck by it fall
into a deep slumber for 100 years. Partly true: A magical
sword does indeed hang in the manor, though its powers
are somewhat misunderstood.

13. Madame Shantywood’s eternal youth: Madame Shantywood procures her eternal youth by selling the souls of
young men to unscrupulous fairies. False: Shantywood is
neither eternally young nor in league with fairies.

8. The smokehouse bogle: A kindly bogle has taken up
residence in the cellars of the smokehouse, tidying the
firewood and smoking racks if weary fishers leave them in
disarray. False: Items in the cellar are sometimes moved
by the Atacorn Crewithyant, who lurks there.

9. Madame Shantywood’s schemes: Madame Shantywood
has ambitions that extend beyond her isle. She has taken to
hosting private parties for local aristocrats in an attempt
to entangle the unwary in her web of intrigue. True.

9. The witches’ inn: The inn just south of the Ditchway,
along Harrid’s Path (1010), is run by a pair of hags who practice witchcraft and kidnap those guests whose faces they
do not like. False.

10. Nyfward: The perplexing tower of the mad magician
Nyf Nimbly stands beside the Hameth in the woods to
the south (1111). Nyf guards magical doorways to Fairy and
many other wizard-realms, which he allows others to use,
for a price. Partly true: No doors to Fairy are to be found
in the tower.

10. Thieves in the Shack: The centre of criminal activity in
Dreg is Shodgerey’s Shack. Shodgerey himself is a member
of the notorious guild of thieves. False: While many of a
criminal inclination hang out in the Shack, the thieves’
guild is based in the Spawning Salmon.

11. Pollard’s visions: The ruler of the Woodcutters’
Encampment, Jollie Oistace Pollard (1209), has become
withdrawn and contemplative. He spends his days inhaling the smokes of an odd crystal that grants him visions
of other worlds. True.
11. Secret tavern: The bog-workers keep a secret drinking den in the ruined farmhouse just north of town. The
constabulary is planning a raid to shut it down. Partly true:
The ruined farmhouse is used as a secret meeting place, but
it is not merely an unlicensed drinking den.

Rumours in Fort Vulgar

1. Vulgar knights: Fort Vulgar and the Vulgar knights are
so named as a term of disparagement by those angry at the
taxes the knights levy on the goods passing through. False.
2. Chookers: Those who encounter Big Chook and live typically become wild obsessives known as “Chookers.” Bargefolk can always tell if the monster is approaching because
the Chookers crowd the shores to hear its eerie song. Partly
true: Chookers are too addled to be a truly reliable guide
to the Big Chook’s activity.
3. The Gaunt: Sir Osric the Gaunt’s epithet originated many
years ago—he was once practically emaciated. Now, he’s
addicted to a special witch’s elixir that bestows a robust
and hearty constitution. False.
4. Blood worms: Townsfolk have been finding blood-red
worms with human-like mouths in the soil. Father Edgar
Drabe fears they indicate an incursion from the Nagwood.
Partly true: The origin of the worms is unknown.
5. Ruined Abbey: Strange lights have been observed in the
Ruined Abbey of St Clewyd (0906). Recent expeditions,
however, reported no signs of life beyond flocks of malevolent blackbirds. True.
6. Hoarblight Keep: Across the waters of Lake Longmere
stands the fearsome ruin of Hoarblight Keep (0505), once
the Cold Prince’s seat in Dolmenwood. Strange presences
and lingering magic mark the castle as a site of unusual
activity. True.
7. Isle witches: On particularly windy nights, luminous
women can be seen floating above the Isle of Yeth (0505),
performing some kind of ritual in the air. What that could
be, so close to the ruins of Hoarblight Keep, is unknown.
Partly true: A ritual is occurring, but its proximity to Hoarblight is coincidental.
8. Missing bard: A letter recently arrived from Prigwort’s
Maydrid Hydball (p178), asking after her lover, the bard
Gherigew Thorncripe. He was last seen heading westward
from Fort Vulgar several months ago. He must have either
abandoned Maydrid for another lover or have perished.
Partly true: Thorncripe is close to death, having fallen prey
to the galoshers’ pool (0604).
9. Cheese sacs: South-west of Hoarblight (0405), wanderers
have noted sacs of human and breggle skin stuffed with a
blood-black cheese. These sacs are the work of a deranged
mossling lurking in the woods. Partly true: The sacs are
real, but their creator is something else.
10. Falls prison: A frost elf was once spied atop the Falls of
Naon (0504) before being pursued by a group of Drunes and
taken into a secret prison behind the Falls. Partly true: The
sighting is real, but there is no Drune prison.
11. The water dragon: The king of the merfauns (0605) has
spoken to sailors of a wondrous water-dragon that lived
in Lake Longmere many centuries ago. Big Chook killed
and ate the dragon, taking its place as guardian of Lake
Longmere. Partly true: Big Chook is actually the manifest
nightmare of the imprisoned water-dragon, Gheillough
(0606).

446

12. Ancestor worship: The northern people of Drigbolton
(0702) have secret locked rooms in their houses where they
keep the mummified bodies of their dead relatives. If you
ask to see these rooms, they deny their existence. True.
13. The burnt cottage: To the north, in a clearing of rotting
firs, is the burnt remains of a cottage (0603). At night,
strange voices whisper and murmur angrily to one another
in the dark. No one has been bold or foolish enough to
speak with them. True.
14. The moaning sphere: South of Hoarblight Keep (0506),
an enormous granite sphere sits atop a flat, windswept
marsh. It emits a moan loud enough to be heard for miles,
capturing the souls of all who die nearby. Partly true: The
sphere exists but does not capture souls.
15. Golden goose: A party of minor nobles led by one Sidney
Tew left Fort Vulgar recently, just before they completely
wore out their welcome. The group headed west towards
the Northern Scratch, crowing about their hunt for a goose
that lays golden eggs (0103). True.
16. Chalk column: Fort Road passes by the southern side of
Prigmarinn Hill (0805), which is topped by a 20′ tall column
of roughly hewn chalk. Carving your name into the chalk
can lift any curse, and hundreds of names already adorn
the column. True: But lacks the full context of the column’s
powers.
17. Phantom isle: Sometimes, in the middle of Lake Longmere (0706), the shimmering mirage of a small island
topped with cypresses and a mausoleum appears. If
approached at any time other than the dead of night, it
vanishes. True.
18. Derodand Manor: Heading up Quogg’s Creek takes
you past Derodand Manor (0704), home to Lady Emelda
Haeroth, a noble of House Harrowmoor. The lady lives as
a recluse, hiding the skeletons of the rest of her family,
whom she murdered with evil magic. False: The lady’s presence is true, but the reason for her seclusion is utterly false.
19. The toll bridge: Crookhorn soldiers have blockaded a
bridge partway up Quogg’s Creek, charging a toll of any
ships or travellers passing through—if they don’t simply
attack and rob them. True.
20. The lake wyrm: Barges traversing the Avernal Lake,
to the north-east (0802), hug the north-western banks to
avoid the phlegm wyrm lairing in the southern waters.
Local witches know how to soothe the wyrm’s rapacious
nature. True.

Rumours in High-Hankle

1. Town of hedonism: The enforcement of law and order
has become increasingly lax under the reign of the current
Baron Hogwarsh. It has become clear he simply doesn’t
care, content to distract himself with revelry and debauchery. True.
2. The master thief’s den: The Balustrade is the place to
be, especially if one is in the market for drinking, dancing,
and mind-bending elixirs. It’s not much of a secret that the
establishment’s owner, Bagsley Corundum, is the master
of High-Hankle’s thieves. True.
3. Fairy sage: Gemrand Soliquant is the town’s current
Florid Envoy and Fairy specialist. Secretly a fairy himself,
he spends his days seeking Fairy artefacts and talismans,
secretly abetting an elfish invasion of Dolmenwood. False:
Though not a secret fairy, Soliquant does wish for the Cold
Prince’s return.
4. The Orange: Sir Hoarsent Waverly is the Baron’s closest friend and the finest knight in the land. Despite his
frequent romantic dalliances, there is talk someone has
finally captured his heart. True: Waverly is in love with
the Baron.
5. The Silent: Members of the Order of St Signis have been
surreptitiously inquiring after anyone who may have
passed by the Abbey of St Clewyd recently, wanting to know
what, if anything, they saw there. True.
6. A like friend: Lord Malbleat has been seen in the
company of the Baron, bonding with a fellow aesthete. In
private, the Baron has promised to help the longhorn get
the upper hand in his conflict with Lord Ramius. Partly
true: The Baron and Malbleat are friendly, but no promises
or offers have been made yet.
7. Escaped griffons: Sir Waverly is offering a substantial
reward for the capture of three griffons that escaped the
Griffonry and flew north. The creatures have been spotted
lairing on Monk’s Hill. They are trained to land next to
someone ringing a small bell. Partly true: Bells have no
special control over the griffon other than attracting their
attention.
8. Ramius’ plot: Lord Ramius has spent years now trying
and failing to capture and tame an ancient monstrosity
known as the Bicorne, which lurks east of Galblight (0510).
True.
9. Stone faces: The wild grassland to the south-east (0612)
is dotted with boulders with an uncanny resemblance to
humanoid faces. They are all that remains of the victims
of a petrifying monster that lurks nearby. False.

10. The tower of birds: The Order of Warffles is based
out of a black stone tower to the south-west (0412). The
Order’s commander, the longhorn Fannigrew Lockelope,
has extensive first-hand knowledge of a horrible monster
known as the Bicorne. True.
13. The magpies: A gang of humans dressed as magpies
has been attacking merchant caravans as they travel along
the Swallop Road (0611). After their successful robberies,
they turn into real magpies and fly away. Partly true: The
gang exists, but can only summon the aid of magpies, not
transform into them.
14. Cursed inn: The Inn of the Tankards stands at a junction
to the north (0511). The inn was built on the site of a wicked
hag’s grave, bringing bad luck to all who stay there. Partly
true: The bad luck is real, but caused instead by the wood
the inn was built with.
15. Fraudulent puss-king: The roadside shrine to the King
Pusskin (0711) is an elaborate con to trick passersby into
leaving gifts for some ne’er-do-well grimalkin. False: King
Pusskin is very real.
16. Lankston: The ruins of the town of Lankston can be
found somewhere in the hills to the north (0610), sunken
into the muck. The pale light of ghosts can be seen flitting
about over the ruin at night. Partly true: The undead threat
in Lankston is bog corpses, not ghosts.
17. The animal orchestra: Near Lankshorn, along Swallop Road (0710), is a farmyard where one can witness an
elaborate and wondrous animal orchestra. The animals’
musical talent is due to them actually being transformed
people. False.
18. Mannog’s garments: Old Mannog Murderman lives
in a farmstead to the north-west, near Bove’s Road (0411).
His one-of-a-kind sheep produce woollen garments that
can magically transform the wearer’s appearance. True.
19. Sleepwalking kidnappers: Bands of seemingly sleeping shorthorns have been kidnapping people near the
hamlet of Galblight (0409), taking them to be sacrificed
to the Nag-Lord. Partly true: The kidnapped sacrifices are
intended for the Bicorne (0510).
20. Red bandits: A bandit group has been striking at caravans on Bove’s Road from somewhere in the nearby woods.
Red Gwen, the group’s leader, is the exiled sister of Lord
Murkin, gathering resources to take her revenge. False:
Gwen was born a titleless urchin but spreads rumours to
build her prestige.

21. Dancing shadows: Shadows dance around a great sandstone monolith in a field of thistles to the east (0812). If
you give your shadow leave to join the dance, you become
immortal—no one without a shadow can die. Partly true:
The dancing shadows are real, though losing one’s shadow
does not actually confer immortality.
22. Swinescombe: A drunken tax collector was overheard
babbling in Coldlanks about the hamlet of Swinescombe
(0912) having been taken over by talking pigs. He later burst
into tears and began calling his gold “swine money.” True.

Rumours in Lankshorn

1. Berkmaster’s mistress: The Berkmaster secretly sends
provisions to his mistress and second family, hidden in a
woodland hut to the north-east (0808). Partly true: The
provisions are for the magician Merridwyn Scymes, whom
the Berkmaster has contracted to discover a means of
curing his grandson’s curse.
2. Berkmaster’s prisoner: The Berkmaster holds a secret
prisoner in his attic. Partly true: The rumour relates to the
Berkmaster’s fugitive, half-breggle, half-human grandson,
who secretly lives in the attic.
3. Drune in the woods: The “Watchers of the Wood” lurk
under the eaves of the forest on moonlit nights, regarding
the merrymakers in Lankshorn with loathing. They plot
to turn the roots of the trees against the town and replace
Lord Malbleat with their own dark hierophant. False: The
Drune do dwell in the woods to the north, but have no
plans to depose Malbleat.
4. Duke Pole’s lost galleon: The mad Duke Pole (the
great-grandfather of Duke Thespian III) sailed a galleon up
the Hameth and into Lake Longmere. It now lies sunken in
the mud, close to Wight Falls. The duke’s fabled planetary
clock was aboard the galleon when it was sunk, though
lake-beasts have most likely made off with it by now. False.
5. King’s Mounds: The burial mounds in the woods to the
south-east (0810) were originally built by the folk of the
ancient King Hoarth, who would inter honoured warriors
in woodland graves. True.
6. Lost statue: A company of friars took a statue of the
obscure Saint Nuncy into the woods to the west (0609) and
lost it, some centuries ago. True.
7. Magical bladesmith: The bladesmith, Joremey, practices
a magical smith-craft taught to him by fairies. Partly true:
It was taught to him by his father (of elf ancestry).
8. Malbleat’s piety: Lord Malbleat makes frequent visits
to Father Dobey, seeking spiritual guidance. Partly true:
His visits are frequent, but the two do not discuss religion.
9. Malbleat’s sorcery: Lord Malbleat possesses a tome of
black magic, which he uses to enslave the minds of any
who cross him. True.
10. Milk or mice: If you travel south, be sure to take a tribute of milk or mice for King Pusskin (0711). True.
11. Mind-addling substances: The local apothecary has
begun stocking a range of weird substances. The proprietor, Sydewich Maldwort, makes regular trips to Dreg to
acquire these compounds (and doubtless to also indulge
in the pleasures the port-town has to offer). Mostly true:
The compounds are acquired from pedlars, not from Dreg.
Maldwort visits Dreg to see his lover.
12. Nightworms: If you travel east along the Ditchway,
make sure to stay off the road at night. The woods are
teeming with giant red worms that crave human flesh
(0809). True.

448

13. Pot-head fairies: The mounds in the woods to the southeast (0810) are haunted by a rabble of fairies. Their chief is
a bowl-headed scamp known as Thraggletwist, who spies
upon travellers along the Ditchway. Partly true: The fairy’s
name is Thrattlewhit. He is in love with a local Braithmaid,
whom he besottedly follows, but does not spy on travellers.
14. Secret passage: A secret escape tunnel once led from
the church into the woods. No one knows if it’s still there.
Mostly true: Father Dobey makes regular use of the tunnel.
15. Sunken Lankston: The ruins of the accursed town of
Lankston lie submerged in the sludge-rimmed pool along
the western road (0610). True.
16. The Black Tomb of the longhorns: The remains of
many generations of longhorn nobles are interred in the
crypts beneath Shadholme Lodge (0709). Lord Malbleat,
obsessed with the glory of his forebears, spends more time
lingering in the crypts than he does with his own wives.
True. Malbleat desires to raise his sorcerous ancestor, Lord
Gnarlgruff, from the dead.
17. The black unicorn: The Nuncle-Stones were once the
site of a great summoning gone awry, whereby a black
unicorn spirit was released from its prison in hell. The
beast has lurked in the heart of the wood ever since, spreading evil and discord. False: Though such legends are likely
inspired by the presence of Atanuwë in the north.
18. The grimalkin’s revenge: The grimalkin proprietor of
Bogway’s, Whimsly Bobblefrock, was bested in a game of
cards by the illustrious Madame Shantywood. The vengeful fairy now hates Shantywood and is plotting a grisly
doom for her. Partly true: Bobblefrock does hate Madame
Shantywood and would gladly see her destroyed, but the
genesis of their antipathy is far more serious—she was
imprisoned in Chateau Shantywood for gambling debts
and only escaped with the aid of a sympathetic bard.
19. The Trothstone: Longhorn nobles may only be married
at the great stone slab in the woods to the west (0609),
called the Trothstone. Mostly true: The stone is used for
this purpose, though longhorns may equally marry elsewhere.
20. Unwanted children: Crying the magic word “Leeleeglablea” on a moonlit night summons the longhorn crone
Shub’s Nanna (p47) to whisk away an unwanted child.
In return, her servants pay 13 silver pieces. True.

Rumours in Meagre’s
Reach

1. Temporal dreams: Many villagers have vivid dreams of
the lives they would have led—including their eventual
deaths—if the village had not been rescued from time.
True.
2. Barhaim’s son: An outsider visiting Chateau Mauvesse
(1802) claims to have seen a figure who resembled Reynold
Barhaim’s son Rodrick, despite Reach locals being unable
to travel so far. True.
3. Redhearth’s rebels: Benedict Redhearth is stirring a
rebellion against Ygraine, with his recruits gathering at a
war camp to the west of the village. True.
4. Heaven’s light: Sister Nancy Delora insists that the
village’s vicar, Hallyman, is “away on pilgrimage.” In fact,
this is a cover for the fact she murdered him for speaking
out against Ygraine. False: The vicar left the Reach and
disappeared into oblivion, as Delora secretly knows.
5. Monster parts: Local sage Lorrima Gravesby has been
securing monster parts, ostensibly for study. In truth, she
grafts these pieces together in her basement in the hopes
of creating a monstrous servant. False.
6. Dream thief: Tensions have risen between Ygraine and
her fairy allies, ever since the sorceress began hoarding
the dreams of the Reach’s villagers for herself. Partly true:
Tensions have risen between Ygraine and the Duke Who
Cherishes Dreams, but not because she has been gathering
or withholding dreams.
7. Dream boats: At night, swan-like ships can be seen crossing the Dark Mirror (1802). Boarding one of these ships
takes you to the land of dreams. Partly true: These ships
come and go from Hypnagogia in Fairy.
8. Deorling choir: In the hills to the north (1702), a choir
of deer-like women can be found by their low, sibilant
chanting. This is a futile mating chant, as all the males of
their kind disappeared long ago. Partly true: The song is
in veneration of their patron deity. Deorling stags are not
actually missing.
9. Skull augurs: Atop a low hill surrounded by thorn trees
to the north (1602) is a collection of weathered skulls
painted with glyphs. Sacrifices of precious treasure cause
the skulls to speak, rasping out secret goings-on elsewhere
in Dolmenwood. True.

10. Time scars: Wanderers who brave the forest south of
Chateau Mauvesse (1801) risk falling through cracks in time
and vanishing into the far future or distant past. False:
Disappearances in the area are caused by the Lonely Tree.
13. Merry lodgings: Labourers who have got lost heading
east to the Dark Mirror report stumbling across a quaint
cottage in a valley of foxgloves (1903). The house’s furnishings came alive when the lost souls entered, commanded
by the witch inhabitant to expel intruders. Partly true: A
witch does not dwell in the cottage.
14. Lost mine: North of Chateau Mauvesse (1801) is a
blighted hillside, the poison from an ancient mine so thoroughly soaked into the earth that it birthed a monster that
scares even the birds away. Partly true: The mine didn’t
create a new monster, but it did corrupt an existing being.
15. Ogre lair: When following the Downs Road up into the
Table Downs, watch for a cave mouth overlooking the path
(1701). Inside the cave lives a clan of ogres, and a young
human girl kept as a slave. Partly true: The human girl
Hilda is in fact part of the ogre family.
16. True giant: Three hundred years ago, a true giant used
to wander the hilly woods to the north (1601). No one has
heard of this giant since the Reach was displaced, however,
meaning it likely passed on in the meantime. Partly true:
The giant isn’t dead, just sleeping.
17. Unicorn gate: In the fairy Duke Mai-Fleur’s domain to
the west (1502) is a pair of oak trees atop a hill, both carved
to resemble rearing unicorns. The fairy Wild Hunt has been
spied emerging from between these carvings, charging
from Fairy on the trail of magical game. True.
18. Hoglyn’s Spire: A turret of white marble juts from the
canopy of the forest to the south-east (1904). Despite the
keep seemingly being in ruin and long abandoned, lights
can be seen in the windows of the tower’s highest storeys
at night. True.
19. Ygraine’s visitors: Lady Ygraine is rarely seen these
days, constantly entertaining various courtiers and emissaries from Fairy. If a mortal visitor is lucky, however, she
might spare time to consult on occult matters. True.
20. The Frozen: The three Frozen who stand in the village
square are just the beginning. Eventually, every Elder in
the Reach will stop moving and freeze into a statue too.
False.

21. The dead man: A man wielding a blazing torch that
illuminates the weapons pin-cushioning his rotting body
has been seen stalking the bogs near the hamlet to the
south-west (1603). He was cursed with a wretched unlife for
trying to assassinate the sorceress Ygraine. Partly true: The
man, Mathonwy, was raised by the Endstone, not cursed.
22. The woodgrue king: An emissary of the Goblin King
has taken up court in a grotto to the south (1704), styling
himself “king of all woodgrues.” At night, the sounds of
his raucous parties carry on the wind. Partly true: The
alleged woodgrue king is a fraud who has never even met
the Goblin King.

Rumours in Odd

1. Fairy hunting grounds: The fairy Duke Mai-Fleur claims
territory to the north and east as part of his personal hunting grounds. Certain villagers have forged a dark deal with
him in order to hunt on his lands. False: The villagers are
just engaging in poaching.
2. Finger trap: Although Mogget Crookbone, proprietor
of the Moggle’s Gob, claims to have lost three fingers to
an owlbear, she really had to chew them off after getting
caught in her own trap. False.
3. The Orbstone: The black monolith forming the church’s
spire is an ancient, natural landmark once used for navigation. False: The monolith is a magical stone placed in Odd
long ago by the Drune.
4. Fine garments: Luxurious garments of fine fur can be
purchased at the headman’s lodge. Those who have won
the locals’ trust can even purchase clothing made from
the hides of magical beasts. True.

5. The Dungle-Crack: In the forest to the north (1402) is a
small chasm overlooked by silvery trees. Entering reveals
a strange, twisting canyon, unmarked on any map, where
the sun appears swollen and red against a midnight sky.
True: The chasm leads to the Narrow Way.
6. The hunting lodge: The hunting lodge of the fairy Duke
Mai-Fleur lies hidden in the hilly woods to the north-east
(1502). In his arrogance, the Duke never leaves servants or
guards behind to protect his lodge during a hunt. Partly
true: The hunting lodge exists but it is secretly protected
by animated stuffed animals.
7. The Wild Hunt: Duke Mai-Fleur leads the fairy Wild
Hunt on frequent, raucous charges throughout Dolmenwood. Sufficiently impressive hunters can join the hunt by
standing in front of the train and offering their weapons.
Partly true: That Mai-Fleur would stop his hunt on behalf
of an impressive hunter is pure speculation.

8. Beast saint statue: The statue of St Hamfast is adorned
with hides and a boar’s head as a hunters’ tribute, ensuring
the saint’s blessing and the village’s fortune. False.

6. Fox traps: The forest to the north-east (1503) is strewn
with dangerous traps set by Duke Mai-Fleur and his retinue
to capture the region’s fairy foxes. Partly true: The area
being full of traps is correct, but it is the fairy foxes who
set them, not Mai-Fleur.

7. Local authority: House Guillefer ostensibly rules Odd,
but neither Lord Guillefer nor his soldiers are seen around
these parts. Broobe Dogoode runs the village freely as
headman, which is just fine by the villagers. Partly true:
Dogoode was appointed to his position by the Drune.

7. Night ambush: Trappers travelling north met a dying
man who narrowly escaped a night-time ambush on the
Downs Road (1401). He described his attacker as “like a
dread prince” before he expired—an elf knight, most likely.
Partly true: His attacker was the necrophage Grinstead.

8. The sprite war: Two tribes of sprites are accosting people
coming to and from the village, each seeking assistance
in a war against the other. Both offer fantastical treasure
in exchange for help. Partly true: Both groups do want
to rope outsiders into their conflict, but any promise of
treasure is a trick.

8. Queen Incantral: Hunters a day’s travel north-west
(1302) were recently chased away from a ruined chapel
by wild-eyed men wielding shortbows and raving about
“Incantral, Queen of the Table Downs.” True.

9. Witches gathering: A group of witches was seen travelling east along Lochsbreth Road, veering off just before the
village and heading south through the forest. Witches have
been seen nearby before, most often just before solstices
and equinoxes. True.
9. Ancient barrows: Burial mounds over a millennium
old dot the misty landscape to the south-east (1504). All
of these belong to a single ancient king, whose body and
treasure were chopped up into a thousand pieces and
buried in a thousand tombs. False: The presence of the
barrows is correct, but the story of their origin is fictitious.
10. Black tentacles: Strange masses of bloody tentacles
have been found to the south (1404). These are cast-offs
of a gargantuan, mutant octopus, which emerges to hunt
from a pool in a hidden glade. False.
11. Woodwind trees: Melodic, singing trees can be found
to the north-west (1303). A band of woodgrues lives nearby,
harvesting the wood to make some of Dolmenwood’s finest
musical instruments. True.
12. Unicorn hunting: The best place to catch a unicorn is
a glittering pool of water to the north (1402), where the
creatures drink peacefully and unprotected. Partly true:
The unicorns are in fact guarded by monstrous black oaks.
This rumour is likely told by a poacher hoping to create a
distraction.

450

19. Healing spring: Far to the north, in the Table Downs
(1501), lie the ruins of a long-forgotten hamlet and a healing
spring. A legion of malevolent undead guard the empty
settlement. Partly true: The hamlet is full of undead, but
they are friendly rather than malicious.
20. The kelpie inn: Before you reach Harrowmoor Keep on
the Lochsbreth Road, you pass by the Breath of the Kelpie
Inn (1204). The view down into the Groaning Loch is to
die for, but the landlord Hallyd Ongledrome is a man as
treacherous as the kelpies below. True.

Rumours in Orbswallow

1. Moontree-kin: The Moontree is the last scion of a forest
of such trees, which once lay to the south. Now all that is
found there are orb-fungi (1406)—pale imitations of the
beauty of the Moontree. False: The two species are unrelated, though similar.
2. Woodgrue compost heap: Woodgrues come from all
over Dolmenwood to bury their dead in a huge compost
heap in 1306. Partly true: The woodgrues gather here to
defecate, not to compost their dead.
3. Elf court: Elves keep a secret court in 1406. Partly true:
Doors to the realm of Whyforth, in Fairy, are present here.
4. Evil marsh spirits: Beware the powers of the bog in 1306:
mosslings who fish there in the summer have returned
with their minds addled by marsh spirits. Partly true: The
madness is caused by the presence of the vorpal monolith.
5. Rock-worshippers: A day’s travel through the forests to
the north gets you straight to the human village of Squobb
(1403), where folk worship rocks and farm animals speak
with human voices. Partly true: The location is correct (the
village of Odd), but the “facts” are mere fancy.
6. Ales of Prigwort: The best markets in the region are
to be found in Prigwort (1106), a day’s journey west along
Mulcher’s Path. Their ales rival those of Orbswallow. True.
7. The Master of Locks: An old, greatly respected
mossling—Limbly, Master of Locks—dwells in a burrow
in 1706. He knows every lock within Dolmenwood and can
coax them to open and close as he wishes. True.
8. Mould oracle: An oracle dedicated to the clay-god
Mbombre lives in a hidden grotto in the woods to the north
(1405). She has powers of healing and may be consulted in
times of need. True.
9. Henchgate: The faces in the wooden gate along the
humans’ road to the south (1407) are the spirits of
mosslings entrapped there by an evil sorceress in days
of yore. Only her ghost, which wanders Dolmenwood
enchanting mortal folk, can release them. False.

10. Blinding eye: A giant floating eye lurks in the bog
forest to the north (1404), striking people blind with its
enchanted gaze. False: The blinding effect is actually
caused by a magical pylon.
15. Arcane arch: The Weaning Arch, under which initiates are bathed in milk, is inscribed with a secret magical language. If it could be deciphered, its power would
purge any threat to the folk of Orbswallow—including the
nutcaps. Partly true: The power in the arch is real, but it
could just as easily be the mosslings’ undoing.
16. Mission to the moon: The great mossling adventurer
Blumber now lives several days travel to the north-east in
a manor made entirely of cheese (1804). She is conspiring
with a group of rat-folk to return them to the moon. Partly
true: Blumber’s desire to travel to the moon is correct, but
her manor is not made of cheese, nor is she in league with
any rat-folk.
17. Mossling monarch: Folk in the fungal forest to the
north-east (1505) worship an ancient mould oracle, grown
to gargantuan size and known as “Queen Shlobrot.” Partly
true: A “Queen Shlobrot” does exist, but it is not a mossling.
18. Sapling sabotage: Though many attempts have been
made to create cuttings or crossbreeds of the three trees,
all have failed. Brimbul (leader of Orbswallow) suspects
someone has been sabotaging the process—nutcaps in all
likelihood. False.
19. The Duke: The proprietor of the Sombre Lamb, Phrobe,
is secretly entreating with the Duke of Brackenwold, who
visits him upon the back of a unicorn. Their dealings regard
some great and secret threat to the entirety of Dolmenwood. False.
20. Vision quests: Eating one of the mouldering offerings
at the fungal shrine to Blosquom induces psychedelic
visions, providing answers and secret insights to a seeker’s
questions—assuming they’re of strong mind (and stomach). True.

21. Nutcap raiders: Nutcaps have been launching raids on
Orbswallow to steal fruits from the magical trees. Their
leader hoards these fruits somewhere in the nearby forest
(1405), using them to brew a poison deadly to mosslings.
Partly true: The fruit theft is correct, but the nutcaps’
leader—the priest Creekeek—has alchemical, not malicious, uses for the fruit.
22. Bloody tentacles: Bloody piles of writhing tentacles in
the shapes of animals and people have been found in the
glades to the north (1404). True.
23. Constant ticking: Travellers moving through the
fungal forest to the south-east (1506) report hearing a
constant ticking sound. The noise comes from an enormous clock hidden beneath the earth with power over time
itself. Partly true: The sound is caused by the Clockwork
Assembly, a device of unknown function.
24. Headless god: On nights of the new moon, a procession
of stags is occasionally seen in the giant fern-woods to the
north-west (1305). The animals ecstatically follow a colossal
headless being as it lurches through the woods. True.

Rumours in Prigwort

13. Poisoned glades: Beware the woods to the west (1006),
where the trees are possessed by evil spirits and exude a
poisonous fume into the air. All who go that way return
with their flesh bruised and inflamed, if indeed they return
at all. Partly true: The curse is actually caused by magicks
around the Locus of Limwdd.

14. Brewmasters’ secret: The secret ingredient in the
Brewmasters’ prize spirits is mossling bones! The bones
are procured by unscrupulous gravediggers who enter
mossling villages under cover of night. False.

3. Shortcut west: If you intend to travel westwards, it’s
quicker to use the shortcut indicated by the old signpost
that stands about 10 miles along Swinney Road (1005).
False: This “advice” is given by someone with malicious
or capricious intent.

4. Alchemy and brewing: The herbalist, Wyrmspittle,
dabbles in alchemy. He would pay dearly for the secrets
of the Brewmasters craft, which he suspects to be of an
alchemical nature. True.

2. Drouge and the Bagwall: The mysterious magician,
Mostlemyre Drouge, plans to complete the Bagwall and
enchant it to prevent servants of the wicked Nag-Lord
entering Prigwort. False.
3. Enchanted cakes: The baker in the woods to the southeast (1206) has the power to bake enchanted cakes, for the
right price. True.
4. Extravagant pastries: Something fishy is going on at
the bakery in the woods (1206). The miller says that their
orders of flour are utterly insufficient for the extravagant
quantity of pastry they produce. True: They get most of
their dough from the magical pool behind the bakery.
5. Haunted stone: A standing stone of great mystery and
power lies to the north-east (1205). The site is haunted by
the ghost of Lady Harrowmoor’s great-great-grandmother,
who was murdered for her insolence at standing up to
the Drune. Partly true: The presence of the stone and the
phantom is accurate, but the story about her origin is false.
6. Heggid’s antiques: Heggid Axminster, proprietor of the
Oaf in the Oast, keeps pet adders in the cellar to protect
his collection of antique clocks that lies hidden behind a
secret panel. If you keep an ear out at midnight, you can
hear them all chiming in unison. False.
7. Lady Harrowmoor’s dark secret: The nobles of Harrowmoor Keep consort with a monstrous entity in the lake,
which grants them wisdom in exchange for their mortal
souls. Partly true: The Harrowmoor family does consult
with an entity in the lake (see 1105), but it does not claim
their souls.
8. Lost wyrm’s hoard: The wyrm Chasobrithe laired in the
woods to the south (1107), until it was slain by the noble Sir
Windlass (“the laughing knight”). The body of the monster
was never found—its bones may lay in some forgotten
grove, to this day. Partly true: The wyrm is not dead.
9. Magical attire: The high-class tailor, Brandybile, has
contacts in the Shadow House and can craft magical
clothing. Partly true: Brandybile himself cannot weave
enchantments, but he can make the necessary arrangements with the Shadow House.
10. Maydrid the witch: Maydrid Hydball of the Wrinkled
Medlar is an apprentice witch and regularly has secret
woodland meetings with the Witch Queen, reporting on
goings-on in Prigwort. False: The meetings are with her
lover, the wandering bard Gherigew Thorncripe.
11. Pirate’s jewels: The jeweller, Hague Jerricorn, is the
granddaughter of an infamous freebooter who made his
fortune on the high seas. She knows the secret location of
his lost treasure. True.

452

15. Shub’s Finger: If you travel west along Swinney Road,
don’t trust the way-markings on Shub’s Finger (1005)! True.
16. Smyde as Council Overmaster: The Elevated Smyde
Humblebuff, leader of House Pilston, has proposed introducing the position of Council Overmaster (and, naturally,
proposes himself for the role). This would be a major break
with tradition, though it may speed up decision making
in the council. True: Smyde schemes to become the sole
leader of Prigwort and cut the town’s ties with the Earl of
Yellow. (The scheme is not his own—he has come under
the sway of Duke Brackenwold’s court magician, Paglimon
the Perspicacious.)
17. The awlflame: The local Drune wield a magical staff
topped with flaming antlers, known as the “awlflame.” The
antlers were procured from certain special stags who roam
the forest to the north-east (1305). Partly true: The staff has
been stolen by Atanuwë, who uses it as a toothpick.
18. The duke’s secret visits: The duke himself sometimes
visits Prigwort, disguised as a foreign merchant, wearing
a green feather in his cap. The finest suite at the Wrinkled
Medlar is always put at his disposal. False.
19. The Nag-Lord’s spies: The town is teeming with the
Nag-Lord’s spies—grimalkins, mosslings, woodgrues,
and breggles of all kinds. Austache at the Clashed Antler
is looking for trusty folk to help see them off. Partly true:
The suspicion that all non-humans are spies is false, but
Austache’s plan is indeed to drive them out of town.
20. Witch hunters: The garrison being constructed on the
edge of town will house a legion of the Order of St Faxis,
who plan to eradicate all witches in the region. False: It
is to be used by ducal soldiers as a defence against feared
crookhorn attacks.

P a r t E i g h t | App e n d i c e s

Rumours in the
Woodcutters’
Encampment

1. Drune furnging: Elder Woodcutters practise a traditional art of tree maintenance called “furnging,” producing unusual and even magical timbers. Their dark secret
is that this practice was originally invented by the Drune.
False.
2. Mocking bell: The Woodcutter’s ritual of mocking the
Drune empowers the Drounbell with the ability to repel
the Drune when rung. False.
3. Hag’s Addle: The Hag stalks Hag’s Addle at night, seeking to satisfy her desire for flesh—and worse. If caught
in a good mood, she might be willing to strike a bargain,
though any gift is unlikely to be worth the price she
demands. True.
4. Kissing stone: The black obelisk near the village
entrance is a powerful artefact that ancient Woodcutters
secured from the Drune. The foul sorcerers still plot to
steal it back. False.
5. The Hag’s lover: The local Vicar, Father Jymes Horsely,
spends his days and nights wandering Hag’s Addle. The
reason is that he’s the Hag’s secret lover and servant. His
dog Clewyd is a monstrosity in disguise, a gift from the
Hag. False.
6. Dangerous Dreg: Once an ordinary port, the village of
Dreg to the south (1110) has become overrun by rogues and
ne’er-do-wells. A friar arrived there five years ago to help
heal the town, but it seems all he’s done is make things
worse. True.
7. Froggy behemoth: An islet of trunks and fungi drifts
through the black water of the nearby swamp. Those
who’ve seen it report a monstrous frog sitting atop it, seeking prey. Partly true: The nature of the isle is correct, but
the giant frog is just a statue.
8. Chieftain’s manse: The Woodcutters’ chieftain, Jollie
Oistace Pollard, lives in a mansion to the east of the
Encampment (1209). He isn’t one for visitors, however,
and has grown increasingly sedate and withdrawn over
the years. True.
9. Howling stalker: The Bogwitt Path between Ferneddbole
House (1209) and Bogwitt Manor (1210) is rarely used these
days, not least because of the sightings of a horrid, wolf-like
monster that stalks through the forest. True: These are
sightings of the Moonlit Maw (1311).
10. Melodic duellist: Halfway along the Camp Road to
Castle Blackwood is the “Cave Path” (1208), which leads
north-west up to Fog Lake (1207). A fairy has taken up residence along this route, doling out secrets to those who best
her in a musical duel. True.

11. Banished prince: Amongst the flotsam pools in the
north-west swampland (1008) lives an elderly longhorn.
Though he appears to be a simple fisherman, he is actually
a prince in exile. False.
12. The bleached forest: To the west, Harrid’s Path passes
through an area of forest entirely bleached of sound and
colour (1009). Those who travel too near catch the “Grey
Blight,” a contagious disease that transforms those
afflicted into colourless husks. Partly true: The Grey Blight
is real but is neither contagious nor a disease.
13. The blistered woods: To the north-west is a patch of
woods that appears perpetually ravaged by fires (0909).
Amongst the burnt trees lives a pyromancer, a rogue magician obsessed with perfecting his fire magic. Partly true:
The burnt woods exist, but the cause has been misconstrued.
14. Agnel’s hospitality: On the south bank of the Hameth
near Lake Longmere (0807) lives a beautiful woman named
Agnel. Those who have met her speak of her exceptional
hospitality. Partly true: Agnel is indeed hospitable, as long
as no one witnesses her monstrous Atacorn form.
15. Lady Misthraine: A sorceress known as Lady Misthraine
has moved into a partially collapsed tower to the northwest (1007). She has travelled from beyond Dolmenwood
to study its ley lines and is keen to converse with those
learned in such matters. Partly true: Lady Misthraine is in
truth a frost elf courtier sent by the Cold Prince to investigate the Ring of Chell.
16. The hunter: Granny Wolfsbane, a retired monster
hunter, lives in a quaint cottage to the south-east (1310).
She’s cautious around strangers but willing to share her
expertise with those with good intentions. True.
17. Orchard library: Following Camp Road leads to a treehouse inn called the Roost (1309). Nearby is a small cottage
and apple orchard, the owner of which has an extensive
library. True.
18. Pollard’s manservant: Mudmurloe, Jollie Oistace
Pollard’s chief manservant, is often sighted sitting
forlornly on the shores of Fog Lake to the north (1207). He
refuses to discuss what he is doing there or whom he is
waiting to meet. True.
19. Submerged manse: At the far end of Hag’s Addle,
where Lake Longmere flows into the Hameth (0707), is an
underwater manse of domes and spires. Diving beneath
the lake reveals mermaids and their wondrous treasures.
Partly true: The manse exists but is in truth the domain
of boggins.

20. Louping wood: To the north is the “Louping Wood”
(1108), so-called due to the “loop-the-loop” structure of its
trees. Woodcutters once knew the secret of using these
loops to scry into other parts of Dolmenwood, and even
Fairy. Partly true: The Louping Wood is real, but any talk
of the loop’s true purpose is speculation.

Uncommon Spells
Additional magicks that may be discovered in certain locations in Dolmenwood.

Aid

Command

Accompanied by the sound of a hound’s bark, a single
living creature gains 1d6 bonus Hit Points.

The caster utters a command charged with holy power. A
selected creature within range is magically compelled to
obey for 1 Round.

Rank 2 holy spell (0512)
Prayer name: Charity of St Esther
Duration: 1 Round per Level
Range: The caster or a creature touched

Maximum Hit Points: The granted bonus Hit Points can
increase the character’s current Hit Point total above their
normal maximum.

Rank 1 holy spell (0512)
Prayer name: St Ingrid’s Admonition
Duration: 1 Round
Range: 10′

Command: The command is limited to a single word (e.g.
flee, back, stop, surrender, leave, etc.).

Any damage suffered: Is subtracted first from the bonus
Hit Points.

Language: If the command is spoken in a language the
subject does not understand, the spell has no effect.

When the duration ends: If any of the bonus Hit Points
remain, they disappear.

Ineffectual commands: Commands that directly harm
the subject or that enact evil or abusive deeds have no
effect—the spell fails.

The miracle of St Esther: Following the sudden death of her
parents, the youthful Esther inherited a small estate in a region
south of Dolmenwood, along with the title baroness. A devout
follower of the Pluritine Church, she spent her days in prayer at
the family mausoleum, accompanied only by her loyal hound,
who sat patiently outside. Late one evening, her prayers were
disturbed by the hound’s barking. Rushing outside, Esther
witnessed a would-be thief in battle with the dog, about to
skewer it with a wicked dirk. Esther beseeched God to aid the
noble hound, which was unharmed by the thief’s blow and
saw the villain off. Following this incident, Esther was moved
by the plight of the common folk and donated much of her
family’s wealth to the poor. Patronages: Loyal hounds, (grave
wardens), (charitable deeds).

Saving Throw: The subject may Save Versus Hold to resist
the command.

Cannibalise

Rank 3 arcane spell (0502, 0808)
Duration: Instant
Range: Creature touched
This gruesome spell enables the caster to magically absorb
the living tissue of another creature and transmute its
energy to regenerate damage to their own body.
Damage: The caster’s touch inflicts 2d6 points of damage,
ripping flesh from the victim’s body. This damage can only
be healed by magic.
Regeneration: The caster instantly regenerates an equal
number of Hit Points to the damage taken by the target.
Touching: Unless the target is willing or helpless, a successful melee attack is required.
Restrictions: Non-living creatures are not affected.

454

Restrictions: Undead and mindless creatures are unaffected.
The miracle of St Ingrid: As chief librarian of a great abbey,
Ingrid was feared among the acolytes for her austere mien and
her righteous temper. The local baron, a vain and greedy man,
decreed a tithe on all gold and silver in his demesne, ostensibly
to support the strengthening of his soldiery. When his lackeys took their crowbars to a local chapel, Ingrid was among
the clergy dispatched to its defence. Her brusque commands
caused the vandals to prostrate themselves on the chapel’s
floor, not leaving until the following dawn. Patronages: Teachers, librarians, (tithe collectors).

Decay

Rank 1 arcane spell (0808)
Duration: Instant or permanent
Range: Corpse touched
This spell has three usages (chosen when cast):
1. Destroy tissue: A touched corpse or dead body part (e.g.
dismembered limb, extracted organ, etc.) is eaten away
to bones in 1 Turn, devoured by a gruesomely accelerated
mass of maggots and mould. For the purposes of Raise
Dead, a decayed corpse is treated as being 6 days old + 1
day per Level of the caster.
2. Harm undead: Inflicts 2d6 damage against a corporeal
undead monster with flesh (e.g. ghoul, wight). The target
must be touched, requiring a successful melee attack.
3. Ward against decay: Indefinitely protects a single corpse
or dead body part (e.g. dismembered limb, extracted
organ, etc.) from the natural processes of decay and
deterioration.

P a r t E i g h t | App e n d i c e s

Detect Disguise

Rank 1 holy spell (0604)
Prayer name: St Dougan’s Discernment
Duration: Instant
Range: 60′
The reassuring voice of the aged St Dougan speaks in the
caster’s mind, saying simply “be wary” or “be sure.” The
saint’s advice reveals whether a chosen person within
range is disguised by mundane (non-magical) means, for
example with makeup, clothing, wigs, etc.
Saving Throw: The target may Save Versus Spell to resist.
True identity: The target’s true identity is not revealed by
this spell, merely the fact that they are disguised.
The miracle of St Dougan: The elderly Dougan was a night
watchman posted to guard a gate to a great prince’s estate.
While his companions played cards and smoked leaf, Dougan
would sit in quiet prayer, watching the road outside the gate.
One night, as his eyes lit upon an approaching carriage, he
heard the voice of an angel warning him that all was not as it
seemed. As the carriage drew up to the gate, the prince’s aunt
could be seen inside. Despite Dougan’s incredulous protestation, the carriage was admitted to the estate. Dougan himself
was tied in the nearby orchard, still ranting about the false
identity of the carriage’s occupant. Only later was Dougan’s
wisdom discovered—the woman was actually an assassin
who succeeded in poisoning the prince. Patronages: Night
wardens, (orchards).

Drouge’s Arcane
Unravelling
Rank 4 arcane spell (1106)
Duration: 1 Turn
Range: Object touched

Entering into a state of deep concentration for 1 Turn, the
caster gains an insight into any enchantments upon the
object touched.
Detect magic: The caster knows whether the object is
magical and whether the enchantment is permanent or
temporary.
Nature of enchantment: The caster learns the nature and
function of the enchantment about the object, including
whether it is cursed. Command words are not revealed.
Chance of error: There is a 5% chance that the knowledge
gained is erroneous or misleading.
Interruption: The caster gains no knowledge if interrupted
before the 1 Turn duration ends.
Exhaustion: Casting this spell is mentally exhausting—
the caster is unable to cast further spells of greater than
Rank 2 until they have had a night’s rest.
Material component: This spell requires a crystal rod
worth 100gp. The rod shatters when the spell ends.

En Croute

Rank 2 arcane spell (1206)
Duration: Special
Range: 20′
A single humanoid target of Small or Medium size is enveloped in a pastry crust, ready spiced for baking.
Immobilisation: The victim can breathe normally, but
cannot speak and is immobilised by the magic of the crust.
Escaping: The victim may try to break out of the crust, with
success dependant on their Strength: 5 or less: six Turns,
6–8: four Turns, 9–12: three Turns, 13–15: two Turns, 16–17:
one Turn, 18 or greater: 1d4 Rounds.

Fear

Rank 3 arcane spell (0501)
Duration: Instant
Range: 60′ cone, 30′ wide at end
Conjures a cone of magical energy that terrifies those
within it.
Effect: Creatures in the cone must Save Versus Spell or be
struck with terror, fleeing from the caster at maximum
speed for 1 Round per Level of the caster.
Dropping items: Affected creatures have a 60% chance
of immediately dropping anything in their hands. The
chance is decreased by 5% for each Level above 1.

Gingerbread Charm

Ginger Snap

This spell causes a single freshly baked gingerbread figure
(up to 1′ across) to come to life.

A single mortal, fairy, or demi-fey is partially transformed
into crunchy gingerbread for the duration.

Behaviour: Animated gingerbread figures are cunning,
sentient, and independent. The Referee should roll on the
Gingerbread Charm Personality table to determine the
figure’s personality and Alignment.

Affected body parts: For every 3 Levels of the caster, one of
the victim’s limbs is transformed. At Level 14, the victim’s
head is also transformed.

Rank 1 arcane spell (1206)
Duration: 24 hours
Range: Touch

Communication: The caster can communicate with the
gingerbread figure telepathically. This only functions
when the two make eye contact (the gingerbread creature
must be baked with eyes) and enter into a hypnotic trance.
When the duration ends: The gingerbread figure disintegrates into crumbs.

Rank 3 arcane spell (1206)
Duration: 1d6 Rounds
Range: 30′

Effects: Affected body parts are brittle and useless and can
be easily snapped. A successful Attack Roll with the intent
to snap or smash a gingerbread body part will reduce it to
crumbs. Successfully smashing a gingerbread head kills
the victim.
When the duration ends: Transformed body parts that
remain intact return to normal. Smashed body parts are
permanently destroyed.
Saving Throw: The subject may Save Versus Hold to resist
the transformation.

Sanctuary

Surprise: Opposing side has a 4-in-6 chance of being
surprised, due to the gingerbread figure’s stealth.

Rank 1 holy spell (0512)

Loving (Lawful). Wants nothing more than to cuddle and
nestle with its creator.
Duplicitous (Chaotic). Outwardly friendly to its creator
yet secretly strives to undermine their plans.

Wise (Neutral). Surprisingly perceptive when asked for
moral or personal advice.
Demanding (Neutral). Desires luxurious foods, beverages, and bedding. Has tantrums if it doesn’t get its way.

Attacks: An opponent intending to directly attack the
subject must Save Versus Spell. If the save succeeds, the
opponent is unaffected by the Sanctuary spell and may
attack the subject as normal. If the save fails, the opponent
will attack another target instead and cannot attack the
subject while the Sanctuary spell lasts.
Area effects: Affect the subject normally. (e.g. Fireball,
wyrm breath, etc.)
Offensive actions: The Sanctuary spell ends immediately
if the subject takes any offensive action (e.g. attacking,
casting offensive spells, etc.).
The miracle of St Hildace: As a young acolyte in a coastal town,
Hildace was responsible for ringing a great bell in the market
square at dawn to call adherents of the Pluritine Church to
prayer. Following a long siege, the town was conquered by a
pirate army, who set up their camp in the square. Undeterred,
Hildace strode peaceably through the enemy encampment
and proceeded to ring the great bell. Despite their efforts, not a
single pirate was able to lay hands on her, their attacks repelled
by the will of God. Patronages: Bell ringers, (kittens).

Speak With Dead

Trap the Soul

The caster may ask questions of a deceased person, the
spirit’s voice echoing out from beyond the grave.

This spell either traps or releases the life force of a single
living creature, with two usages as follows:

Remains: Some remnant of the person’s physical body (e.g.
bones) must be within range.

1. Trap: The subject must Save Versus Doom or have their
life force sucked out and trapped inside a precious receptacle prepared by the caster (see below). Stripped of its
soul, the victim’s body enters a comatose state and will
die after 30 days, unless the soul is restored.
2. Release: The life force of a trapped target is released,
either into their body (if it is within range) or to another
suitable receptacle prepared by the caster (see below).

Rank 3 arcane spell (1301, 1403)
Duration: 1 Turn
Range: 10′

Rank 6 arcane spell (1205)

Range: 20′

Time since death: It is only possible to awaken the spirit of
a person who died within a certain time frame, dependent
on the caster’s Level (see the Speak With Dead Limitations
table).

depends on the caster’s Level (see the Speak With Dead
Limitations table). The spirit answers truthfully but briefly,
and only possesses knowledge it had during life.
Speech: The spirit speaks with the tongues it knew in life.

Duration: 1 Round per Level
Range: 30′

One shadow (DMB) per three Levels of the caster appears

from this area of gloom.

Transparency

Rank 2 arcane spell (0808, 1009)
Duration: 1 Turn per Level
Range: The caster or a creature touched

Soul Receptacles
Any gem, crystal, or precious object may be used.
Value: The receptacle must be worth at least 1,000gp per
Level of the intended subject.

name (as judged by the Referee) must be used.

of the trapped creature’s face flits across the surface of the
receptacle. The trapped creature may be conversed with.

Yeast Growth
Rank 1 arcane spell (1206)
Duration: Instant
Range: 30′

This spell causes the radically accelerated growth of naturally occurring yeast, with two usages (chosen when cast):
1. Yeast froth: All creatures, objects, and surfaces within
range are engulfed in a slimy mass of frothing yeast.
Affected creatures suffer a 2-in-6 chance per Round of
slipping over and a –1 penalty to Attack Rolls, until they
are free of the yeast. Wiping froth off an object takes 1
Round; clearing a Medium creature takes 2 Rounds.
2. Fermentation: A process of natural yeast fermentation
(e.g. bread rising, beer brewing, etc.) is instantaneously
completed.

The flesh, bones, hair, and internal organs of the subject
become completely see-through, enabling a near-invisibility.
Invisibility: The subject is completely invisible when
stationary and has a 90% chance of remaining undetected
when moving. In encounters, the opposing side has a 5-in-6
chance of being surprised.
Clothing and equipment: Are not affected and must be
removed in order to achieve the full effect.
In combat: The subject may attack normally while transparent. Opponents suffer a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls.

Setting Conception

Dolmenwood was originally conceived by Gavin Norman
and Greg Gorgonmilk in 2013. It was partially developed in
the Wormskin zine (2015–2018), before being fully realised
in the Dolmenwood Player’s Book, Dolmenwood Campaign
Book, and Dolmenwood Monster Book.

Inspiration

Thanks to the originators of early Dungeons & Dragons—
Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson, John Eric Holmes, Tom Moldvay, Steve Marsh, Dave Cook, Frank Mentzer—upon whose
work the rules of Dolmenwood are founded.
Thanks to Matthew Schmeer for the original conception
of Atacorns.
Thanks to Jon Britton (3d6 Down The Line) for inspiration
of the XP for Exploration goals (p107).

Pronunciation Guide
Typical Dolmenwood pronunciation of significant names and Woldish words.

W

ords and names occurring in Dolmenwood are
generally pronounced according to the norms
of English. Additional guidance for pronouncing some of the more unusual words is provided here. Note
that this guide is optional; it presents one possible pronunciation scheme. Groups should feel free to pronounce
Woldish words according to their own preferences, if
desired.

Notes on Pronunciation
‘dh’: The voiced ‘th’ sound in “this,” “that.”
‘oo’: The long ‘oo’ sound in “shoot,” “boot.”
‘uu’: The short ‘oo’ sound in “foot,” “soot.”
‘zh’: The ‘s’ sound in “pleasure,” “vision.”

Abyssinia (Queen): ab-iss-IN-ee-uh

Breggle Languages

Aldweald: ALD-weeld

A small number of Caprice and Gaffe words appear in
the Dolmenwood core books, for example: Aud frengd
Hlerr, Ghrygaile, Hraigl, hregl.

Andromethia (Princess): an-dro-METH-ee-uh
Auldweathe: AWLD-weedh
Atanuwë: a-TAN-u-weh
Aubrathon: AW-bra-thon
Audrune: AW-droon

The special shape of breggles’ tongues and mouths
makes their languages difficult for non-breggles to
pronounce accurately. The pronunciation of these
words is therefore left for each group to decide.

Chapes: CHAYPS
Clewyd (Saint): KLOO-id (common) or KLOOD (posh)
Crewithyant: kroo-ITH-ee-uhnt
Cwrnus: KOOR-nuus
Drodh: DROHDH
Drouge (Mostlemyre): DROOZH
Drune: DROON
Dwelmfurgh: DWELM-furg
Embala: em-BAH-luh
Eœl: EE-uhl

Monsters of
Dolmenwood

M

“

onster” is such a vague and misleading term. It’s the
kind of word you find thrown about in tavern tales
and Pluritine Church dogma. As someone who’s
been called this pejorative term more than once, let me tell you
quite plainly that it means nothing more than something the
one who dares speak it wishes were dead. That’s not to say that
what most common folk would call a monster isn’t dangerous.
Quite the contrary. There are dark and terrible things in the
shadows of Dolmenwood who see folk as nothing more than
prey to be stalked or playthings to be toyed with. But if you’re
foolish enough to dismiss them as a simple “monster” then
you’re playing right into their hands.”
—Whoopla Hogslapper, woodgrue magician

Part One | Monster s of Dolmenwood

Denizens of the Deep,
Dank Woods
The weird beasts, fickle fairies, and strange spirits that inhabit Dolmenwood.

T

his book details a horde of monsters that may
be encountered in the twisted woods, stinking
swamps, and desolate moors of Dolmenwood. It

Adventurers: Standard stat blocks for adventurers of all 9
Classes, including typical equipment and spell selections.

are game animals, insects, spiders, and worms—many of
gigantic and threatening proportions.

87 weird, wondrous, and horrifying creatures for use in
Dolmenwood games, some inspired by fairy tale and folklore, others Dolmenwood variants of classic fantasy creatures, and many entirely new. All are presented with a
colour illustration, easy-to-read game statistics, and tables
providing quick encounters, random traits, and more.
Constructs: Artificial beings created by magic of one kind
or another. They often serve powerful spell-casters as

Plants, fungi, and oozes: Mobile plants, fungi, and gelatinous monstrosities that lurk in the dank places of Dolmenwood. Some are sentient, with their own alien desires,
while others are ravenous monsters that prey on lost travellers.
Undead: Accursed spirits and restless corpses that haunt
the deserted ways of Dolmenwood.

Monster rumours: Lists of rumours relating to the creatures in the bestiary section of this book (half true, half
false).
Monster creation: Guidelines on creating new monsters
for Dolmenwood games, including tables for determining
monster XP values, Attack ratings, and Save Targets.

for encounters are provided inside the book’s front cover.

Individual Variation
The Alignment, behaviour, and speech listed present
typical traits of creatures encountered in Dolmenwood. These are provided as a quick guide for the

Bestiary
O

“

h, you’re back! Wonderful! Deary me, we’ll worry
about that arm later. Don’t be such a baby. It’s only
a flesh wound. Tell me what you ran into this time.
A bog corpse? No, I’ve already got record of those poor, shambling bastards. You didn’t drink from a mould oracle’s cauldron
did you? Sorry, foolish question. Did you meet a devil goat?
No, you seem entirely too coherent for that. Oh, redcaps was
it? Well that explains the head wound and why your sword
scabbard is empty and your boots are missing. That foot isn’t
looking too good now that I get a closer look...”
—Father Nedwynne Hargle, Abbot of the Seminary of 100
Martyrs

Part T wo | Bestiary

Antler Wraith
Sinister spirits made manifest as looming humanoids, cloaked in black, with stag-skull heads
and bony claws. Servants of grim, forgotten gods, doomed to haunt rings of standing stones.
Medium Undead—Semi-Intelligent—Chaotic

Level 4 AC 14 HP 4d8 (18) Saves D10 R11 H12 B13 S14
Attacks Clawed grasp (+3, 1d10 + life drain)
Speed 40 Morale 9 XP 180
Encounters 2d4 (75% in lair)
Behaviour Ruthless, hateful, avaricious
Speech None. Understand Woldish and Old Woldish
Possessions None Hoard C4 + R4 + M1
Undead: Silent before attacking. Immune to biological
effects (e.g. disease, poison) and mind-affecting spells (e.g.
Vapours of Dream, Paralysation, Dominate).
Immunities: Only harmed by silver weapons, magic, or
magic weapons.
Dark sight: Can see normally without light.
Life drain: The touch of an antler wraith drains 1d3 points
of Constitution. A character reduced to 0 Constitution dies
and cannot be raised. Constitution damage can only be
healed by holy magic: Bless heals 1 point.
Sinister silence: Within 60′ of an antler wraith, sound is
hushed and speech feels as if it disturbs something best
left in peace. Characters casting spells have a 2-in-6 chance
of failure (the spell is removed from memory as if cast).
Dormant during the day: During hours of sunlight, antler
wraiths are dormant, manifesting only as a cold mist
around the stones they guard. If their stones or treasure
hoards are tampered with, they manifest fully, coalescing
out of the mist.
Sacrificial victims: Antler wraiths seek out warm-blooded
sentients whom they drag to their stone rings for sacrifice.
Sacrificed victims are buried in the vicinity of the stone
circle, along with their possessions and treasures.

ENCOUNTERS
1

Dragging a young hunter screaming through the undergrowth. 2d3 bloodhounds (see Hounds—DPB) bay wildly
in defence of their owner, but are too terrified to approach
the wraiths.
2 Slowly encircling a group of 2d4 grave diggers (everyday
mortals—p110) who stand rigid with fear beside the
wraiths’ half-unearthed hoard.
3 Preparing to sacrifice 2 young noblewomen (everyday
mortals—p110), bound at the centre of a stone circle.
Their escort, a knight, lies bleeding and dead nearby.
4 Battling 2d3 Drune Cottagers (p35) who are attempting to drive the wraiths from their stone circle. The
Drunes wield a golden skull whose radiance repels the
wraiths.

12

Wields a scythe or ancient sword (damage as per touch).
Utters a single, sinister word, mantra-like.
Skull wreathed in blue flame.
Jewels in eye sockets (500gp each, cursed: –4 Strength).
Antlers draped with shrivelled human intestines.

LAIRS
1

A single giant (20′ high) obelisk of black stone streaked
with veins of blood red. The earth around the stone is
ashen and nearby plant-life is withered and blackened.
2 A ring of blood-daubed boulders at the marshy base of
a dismal, overgrown valley. Skeletons of stags line the
valley—the animals come here to die.
3 A 15′ high spire of white marble upon a lonely, mistwreathed island amid a murky pool. The spire is carved
with time-worn images of human sacrifice.
4 An imposing ring of 5 dolmens, festooned with trailing
moss and strings of human skulls. At the centre of the
ring is a 10′ deep pit filled with mist and an eerie blue radiance. The wraiths’ victims (and their treasures) are cast
into the pit. Anyone climbing down must Save Versus
Spell or be reduced to terrified babbling for 1d6 days.

dose of the vomit is worth 100gp, if bottled.
Origin: Long ago, a magician tried to create companions
of great beauty and wisdom. The magic went awry and

Dark sight: Can see normally without light.
Immunities: Suffer half damage from non-magical weapons, acid, cold, fire, and lightning.
Hunting frenzy: Adventuring parties with favoured food
among them (see below) are in grave danger—once a gelatinous hulk scents food within 60′, it will stop at nothing
to get a hold of it. Otherwise, these monsters are peaceful
and show little interest in other creatures.
Dissolve: Metal that touches a gelatinous hulk (e.g. weapons that strike it and armour it grasps)—is dissolved. Magic
items have a 50% chance of being unaffected per touch.
Seep: A gelatinous hulk can squeeze its giant body through
spaces as small as the crack under a door.
Nocturnal: Gelatinous hulks are only active at night. Use
the Encounters—Daytime or Encounters—Nighttime table
depending on the time of day.
Favoured foods: Gelatinous hulks consume magic items of
all kinds, psychedelic fungi (which they snuffle up in great
swaths), fairies, and demi-fey.
Alchemical brain: The spongy, green brain of a gelatinous
hulk is prized by alchemists (500gp value). The brain can be

Theft (once per target): A goblin may attempt to magically
purloin a valuable trinket (up to 10 coins of weight) they
have seen in a mortal’s possession. If the victim fails a Save
Versus Hold, the item is whisked away into the goblin’s
pack and replaced with an illusory replica which evaporates into mist when touched. If the save succeeds, the
victim feels a momentary tug on the item (which remains
in their possession).
Illusory goods: Goblins sometimes sell illusory goods that
evaporate into mist after 1 hour. Such ruses can be revealed
by Detect Magic and similar.
Code of hospitality: If a goblin is invited into a place by
way of handwritten invitation or swearing an oath of good
behaviour, they are bound by ancient rites of hospitality
and are unable to use their magic of illusion and theft while
within the place.
Appearance: There are many kinds of goblins in Fairy,

Possessions 2d6gp Hoard C3 + R3 + M3
Magic Resistance: +2 bonus to Saving Throws against
effects of magical origin.
Dark sight: Can see normally without light.
Weapons: Harpies favour daggers (1d4), clubs (1d4), and
shortbows (1d6).
Charming song: Those who hear the song of a group of
harpies must Save Versus Spell or come under their sway.
If the Saving Throw fails, the victim is charmed to move
towards the harpies (resisting those who try to prevent
it), to obey the harpies’ commands (if understood), and
to defend the harpies. They are unable to cast spells, use
magic items, or harm the harpies. Killing the harpies
breaks the charm. A character who makes the save is unaffected for the rest of the encounter.
Origin: Harpies were created long ago by the priesthood of
an evil deity in a distant land. Their original function was
as heralds of the deity’s will, their songs relaying prophecies and instilling fanatic devotion. Since the destruction
of their temples by the Pluritine Church, they have spread
far and wide. Many have made their way to Dolmenwood,
attracted to the service of Atanuwë.

Amphibious: Can breathe air and water.
Enchanting song: All who hear the beautiful song of a
kelpie must Save Versus Spell or be enchanted. Victims are
compelled to approach and mount the kelpie (which can
lengthen to carry up to a dozen individuals). Following a
wild, aquatic ride, the kelpie drowns its victims, consumes
their flesh, and leaves their entrails by the water’s edge.
Bridle: One not enchanted by a kelpie’s song may try to
remove its bridle, requiring a successful melee attack. A
kelpie is bound to serve the character for 1d8 days.
Human form: Kelpies sometimes leave the water and
wander the shore in the form of a dashing young human
in old-fashioned, formal dress. They can be recognised by
the pond weed tangled in their hair.
Charm humans: A kelpie in human form may attempt
to charm a human encountered alone. If the victim fails
a Save Versus Spell, they are compelled to wander with
the kelpie. After 1 day, the kelpie attempts to drown and
devour the victim, unless their Charisma is 16 or higher.
In this case, the kelpie falls in love and serves the victim
for 1d8 days before either fleeing or choosing to become
permanently human (equal chance of either).

neck, and limbs extend into great mounds and coils of
furry flesh, expanding to fill a 10′ × 10′ area per Turn. The
monster gains 1 Level per room it overwhelms (to a maximum of Level 18). For each extra Level, the monster gains
1d8 HP and a +1 bonus to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.

Onyx Blob
Huge (20′ across) blobs of amorphous, wobbling black jelly. Ooze relentlessly in pursuit of
living creatures, driven by a mindless urge to dissolve living flesh.
Large Ooze—Animal Intelligence—Neutral

Level 10 AC 16 HP 10d8 (45) Saves D6 R7 H8 B9 S10
Attacks 4 appendages (+8, 1d6 + wrap)
Speed 20 Morale 12 XP 3,550
Encounters 1 (no lair)
Behaviour Relentless, ravenous
Speech Unnerving fizzing
Possessions None Hoard None
Immunities: Only harmed by fire-based attacks.
Eyeless: Can act normally in light or darkness.
Wrap: If an appendage inflicts 4 or more damage, it wraps
around the target and exudes a chill acid, automatically
inflicting 1d6 damage each subsequent Round. The victim
may attack, but cannot move, except by Retreating From
Melee.
Severing appendages: Though blades inflict no damage on
an onyx blob (see Immunities), they can be used to sever
wrapped appendages. A hit that would inflict 4 or more
damage severs an appendage, freeing a wrapped victim.
Retreating from melee: A character can break away from
wrapping appendages by retreating from melee (see
Combat, DPB). This inflicts 1d4 permanent damage (reducing the character’s current and maximum Hit Points), as
flesh is ripped off and cauterised. Powerful holy magic (e.g.
Cure Affliction, Greater Healing) can restore maximum HP
lost in this way.
If hit: Non-fire attacks (including spells) cause the blob to
divide. Each hit creates a bloblet—stats below.
Cling: Can slither up vertical surfaces (e.g. tree trunks,
walls, ceilings, etc.).
Seep: An onyx blob can squeeze through spaces as small
as the crack under a door.

Cold iron: As fairies, redcaps suffer 1 extra point of damage

Knock-out: Redcaps never fight to kill, but only to knock
their foes unconscious. A blow that would reduce the target

Round the redslob may make.
If hit in melee: When a redslob is hit with a melee weapon,
the attacker must Save Versus Hold. If the save fails, the
weapon is ripped out of the attacker’s hand, adhering to
the monster’s sticky mass.
Wield weapons: A redslob may grasp weapons that have

victim becomes entangled in the monster’s rooty grasp.
An entangled victim automatically suffers 1d4 damage per
Round and cannot attack. A Save Versus Hold is allowed,
once per Round, to escape.
Bury / unearth: Root things are able to bury and unearth
themselves completely in the space of 1d4 Rounds. An

by killing the mimicked creature. Physical and magical
capabilities of the adopted form are not gained—the shapestealer always uses the stats listed above.
Absorbing victims: After slaying a mimicked victim, a
shape-stealer can absorb the corpse into its ooze-like body,
gaining their personality and memories in the process.
This takes 1 Turn. The shape-stealer lives as the victim for
2d6 days (or until suspected—see Suspicious Traits), before
fleeing and seeking its next victim.
If killed: A shape-stealer reverts to their natural form—a
transparent, ooze-like humanoid, 7′ tall.
Hoard: Shape-stealers hoard the personal effects of past
victims as mementos of their minds and lives.
Origin: Shape-stealers are servants of the Hag Thorn-Rosy
(DCB), created as consorts and spies. Certain individuals
become obsessed with absorbing mortal experiences and
abscond to Dolmenwood.

Psychic crush: The snail may direct its psionic power into
the mind of a sentient being within 60′, who must Save
Versus Spell. If the save fails, the victim suffers 1d6 damage
immediately and in each subsequent Round for as long as
the snail concentrates (no other actions, half Speed).
Illusions (thrice a day): The snail can manifest psionic
illusions that function like the arcane spell Phantasm, with
the following enhancements:
▶ Senses: Visual, sounds, smells, and thermal elements.
▶ Illusionary monsters: Have AC 14.
▶ Concentration: The snail may move at half Speed
while maintaining an illusion. Even when the snail stops
concentrating, the illusion persists for 3 further Rounds.
Lairs and sleeping: Psionic snails do not keep lairs, but
sometimes lie in slumber for decades, carpeted with weird
plants and fungi (e.g. Black Clover, Horridwort, Mind-Moss,
Puck’s Ear—DCB). Carefully harvesting a portion without
waking the snail requires a Dexterity Check.
Dream projection: A sleeping snail’s dreams produce illusionary scenes up to a mile distant. See Dreams.

grimalkins, sprites) to ride upon their backs.

Monstrous (10′ tall), mossivorous fairies with hairless, clay-like flesh. Their favoured delicacy
is Dolmenwood moss grown on the corpses of sentient beings.
Large Fairy—Sentient—Any Alignment

Level 8 AC 13 HP 8d8 (36) Saves D8 R9 H10 B11 S12
Attacks 2 fists (+7, 1d10 + moss growth)
Speed 40 Morale 10 (or 8, see Fear of fire) XP 1,440
Encounters 1d3 (30% in lair)
Behaviour Muddled, sly, hungry for moss
Speech Lethargic rumbling. Woldish, Sylvan
Possessions None Hoard C5 + R2 + M8 + magical
mosses (3-in-6 chance, see below)
Cold iron: As fairies, trolls suffer 1 extra point of damage
when hit with cold iron weapons.
Regeneration: A damaged troll gains 3 HP at the start of
each Round, as long as it is alive. Severed limbs reattach.
Return from death: If killed (0 HP), a troll regenerates and
fights again in 2d6 Rounds.
Fire and acid: The only way to permanently kill a troll—
they cannot regenerate damage from these sources.
Fear of fire: Morale 8 when attacked with fire or acid.
Moss growth: A creature touched by a troll sprouts moss
at the site of contact, which can only be removed by magic
(e.g. Cure Affliction). If the moss is not removed, the victim
loses 1 Constitution each week. If reduced to 0 Constitution, the character dies and becomes a mound of inanimate moss. Raise Dead is ineffectual upon characters who
perish in this way.
Magical mosses: Trolls sometimes have 2d4 portions of
a magical moss species in their lair (e.g. Frondhelm, MindMoss, Snogglebeard—DCB).
Moss connoisseurs: Trolls wander far and wide in search
of new moss taste sensations. The great abundance of moss
(including delicious ley-infused species) draws numerous
trolls to Dolmenwood.

Energy drain: The touch of a wight reduces the victim’s
maximum Hit Points by 1d3 and incurs a –1 penalty to

Frost touch: The witch may attack in melee with her icy

must also Save Versus Hold or begin to freeze, suffering 1
damage per Round in the subsequent 1d4 Rounds. If this
damage brings the victim to 0 HP, they are frozen solid.
Wind riding: On windy nights, an Eye of Ertta may drift
into the sky and travel through the air. By riding the
currents, she can travel anywhere within Dolmenwood
in 1d6 hours.
Curse of the open sky (once a week): An Eye of Ertta may
bring down the curse of Ertta upon a single target, who
must Save Versus Spell. If the save fails, the next time the
victim is beneath the open sky, there is a 4-in-6 chance of
them being struck by lightning (6d6 damage, Save Versus
Ray for half).

2. Eye of Hasturiel

Secret name of Hasturiel (once a day): Spoken by a witch
in her service, the secret name of Hasturiel causes beings
of Level 6 or less within 20′ to flee in terror for 2 Turns (Save
Versus Hold to resist).
Evil eye (once a day): An Eye of Hasturiel may place a curse

course of 1 Turn. She may remain in this state for up to
1 month, taking physical sustenance from the soil. She
retains an awareness of events on the ground above her.
Clay doppelgänger (once a month): An Eye of Limwdd can
craft a clay double of any mortal whom she has set eyes
upon. The crafting takes one full day, with work commencing at dawn. At dusk, the doppelgänger comes to life as
a Level 1 construct (1d8 HP), and takes on the outward
appearance of the person it mimics. It lives until the
following dawn. The witch may clothe the construct and
entrust it whatever task she wishes. To a casual observer, it
looks exactly like the person copied. Close contact reveals a
slick wetness to its skin. The double cannot speak but may
moan and shout.
Pyre of rebirth (once a week): An Eye of Limwdd may
build a pyre and ritually immolate herself. When the fire

owl must Save Versus Spell. Unless averting their eyes,
characters in melee are affected each Round. Those who
fail have a momentary vision of being a mouse lost in
moonlit woods, hunted and then torn to shreds by owls.
Victims lose 1d3 Wisdom and part of their psyche (see

Possessions Carried by group: roots and mushrooms (see below) Hoard None
Surprise: In woodland, opposing side has a 3-in-6 chance
of being surprised, due to wodewoses’ stealth.
Animal friendship: Animals of all species are fascinated by and instinctively well-disposed towards wodewoses. Animals never attack or chase a wodewose, even if
commanded by their masters.
Attack monsters: Wodewoses hate magical monstrosities
(e.g. wyrms) and wicked servants of Atanuwë (e.g. crookhorns). They attempt to kill or drive all such beings out of
their territory.
Roots and mushrooms: Each wodewose group carries 1d3
portions of an unusual root or mushroom, freshly foraged.
See the Roots and Mushrooms table.
Wodewose blood: The deep brown blood of a wodewose
has healing properties. If applied to a wound, tiny vines
slowly stitch the wound together, healing 1d3 Hit Points
after 1d6 Turns. If drunk, the blood has no healing effect
and causes leaves to sprout from the character’s body after
1d3 days (Save Versus Doom to avoid). A vial of wodewose
blood is worth 200gp. 2d6 vials of blood can be drained
from a dead wodewose.

Wyrm—Overview
Long, limbless, wingless monsters related to the dragons that plague other lands.
he dragons of Dolmenwood differ from those
known in other realms. There are four types, each
associated with one of the four elements and the
four bodily humours: black bile wyrms (earth), phlegm
wyrms (water), blood wyrms (air), yellow bile wyrms (fire).

T

Regeneration

Wyrms of the denser elements (black bile wyrms and
phlegm wyrms) are the least long-lived, the least dangerous, and the most commonly encountered in Dolmenwood. Blood wyrms and yellow bile wyrms are more
powerful and rarer.

Vulnerability

Reproduction

Wyrms reproduce as other reptiles do, laying and incubating clutches of eggs. After hatching from its egg, a
wyrmling remains with its mother for some years. This
is the only situation in which wyrms tolerate each other’s
company—they otherwise harbour a jealous loathing of
their own kind, only meeting occasionally to spawn.

Age

The combat stats presented are for adult wyrms. Immature
wyrms or ancient wyrms of up to 3 Levels lower or higher
may also sometimes be encountered. Immature wyrms
are less likely to be encountered in their lair, while ancient
wyrms are more likely to be encountered in their lair.

Speech and Intellect

All wyrms speak their own tongue as well as that of
serpents and the common tongue of humans (Woldish),
the latter with a varying degree of eloquence. The lesser
wyrms are only capable of uttering the most simplistic
phrases in Woldish, while the greater are silver-tongued
and may speak additional languages (e.g. Sylvan, Old Woldish, and occasionally even High Elfish).

Lairs, Hoards, and
Sleeping

Wyrms are able to naturally recover from grievous
wounds, given time to rest. Even severed portions of their
bodies regrow.

All wyrms have a degree of resistance to weapons. They
also possess a vulnerability by which weapons may inflict
normal damage. The exact nature of this vulnerability
varies by individual. The table below gives some ideas for
wyrm vulnerabilities, but the Referee may invent unique
variations to keep players guessing.
Alchemical analysis: An alchemist can divine a wyrm’s
vulnerability by analysing a small part of its body (e.g. a
scale). This process has the same cost and time as analysing
a potion (see Specialist Services, DPB).

WYRM VULNERABILITIES

Exposure to daylight.
The presence of a pure-hearted virgin.
Hallowed ground.
The light of the full moon.
Unicorn horn.
The stench of rotting fish.
Atheist philosophy.
Witch magic.

Origin

The first wyrms spawned from the corpse of an ancient
Wood God known as Ocryphd, slain by the Cold Prince
and his knights in days beyond mortal memory. In a final
act of vengeance, the bile, blood, and phlegm of the Wood
God’s decomposing body took on the form of wyrms and
slithered away to hidden places to multiply and bide their
time. These creatures and their descendants have plagued
the inhabitants of Dolmenwood ever since.

Wyrms of all kinds make subterranean lairs where they
mound up the treasure that they have amassed. Typically,
they have short periods of activity—wherein they eat flesh
and pillage treasure—followed by long periods of sleep.
When a wyrm is encountered in its lair, there is a chance
of it being asleep.
Creeping up on a sleeping wyrm: Wyrms are light sleepers, keeping one eye half-open most of the time. It is thus
difficult to catch one fully unawares. A normal Surprise
Roll (see Encounters, DPB) is used to determine whether a
sleeping wyrm is caught unawares.

victims’ clothing, and sometimes (2-in-6) lay eggs in the
corpse. Such corpses are devoured by larvae in 2 weeks.
Origin: Yickerwills are the devolved descendants of the
Cold Prince’s moth-faced wardrobe guards, a small number
of whom lingered in Dolmenwood following his banishment into Fairy.

ENCOUNTERS
1

Gleefully feasting on the goods of a clothes merchant,
pulling great armfuls of garments from his caravan. The
merchant and 3 guards lie slaughtered nearby.
2 Attacking a hive of 3d12 killer bees (p116) in the treetops, wishing to steal their honey.
3 Being attacked by a desperate company of 4d6 nutcaps
(p63), attempting to drive the yickerwills away from their
colony in the treetops nearby. The nutcaps will reward
any who aid them with 3 small garnets (100gp each).
4 Creeping up on a group of 2d6 villagers (p111) bathing
tipsily in a bubbling brook. The yickerwills have eyes for
the humans’ clothing, strewn on rocks nearby.

Wings and body emit a smouldering smoke.
Long, spiralling tongue folds in and out.
Rows of tiny, insectoid legs along chest.
Eye patterns on wings.
Ruff of iridescent, peacock-like feathers.
Icicles hanging from wings.

LAIRS
1

A steep, rocky gully lined with silk cocoons in which the
yickerwills slumber.
2 A storm-wracked elm festooned with cast iron lanterns
formed like leering visages. While the yickerwills dream
among the branches, eerie fires flicker on an off in the
lanterns.
3 A network of grottoes formed where a stream trickles
underground. The yickerwills slumber atop mounds of
crushed bone in their larder cave, draped with pristine
sheets of silk and linen.
4 The ruins of an old manor house, its windows smashed
and its interior overgrown with brambles. The yickerwills roost in ancient, decrepit wardrobes in the manor’s
former bedchambers.

“

very fool who goes into the Wood with a sword on
their hip and a pack full of rations will tell you to
watch for monsters, fairies, and whatever other
bogeymen their mind or empty tankard can conjure. The real
truth that no one wants to admit is that the most dangerous
and unpredictable beings you’ll encounter in Dolmenwood
are the ones you see every single day: other people. Humans
and other Kindreds are completely unpredictable. And I don’t
just mean person to person. I’ve seen a devout friar perform
horrific deeds and watched a heartless cutpurse offer kindness
to a wayward child. At least when you run into some strange
beast in the Wood, you have a pretty fair certainty it’s out to
kill you.”

Adventurers
Ne’er-do-wells and righteous questers that one might encounter in the wilds.

E

xample stat blocks for characters of all nine
Classes, at Levels 1, 3, and 5. These may be convenient for use when PCs encounter other adventurers, or for use as bandits, guild members, town guards, etc.
Details: Basic equipment, memorised spells, and so forth
are provided for quick reference. The Referee may alter or
elaborate these as desired.
Non-adventurers: When using these stat blocks for non-adventurers (e.g. town guards), suggested magic items should
usually be ignored and stats reduced accordingly. The average town guard captain does not have magic armaments.

Possessions and Hoards
Possessions: In addition to the listed gear, adventurers
typically carry 2d8gp per Level.
Hoards: Adventurers usually live in a settlement, so
are not encountered in a lair in the wild. When using
adventurer stat blocks for NPCs who do live in the wild
(e.g. bandits), the Referee should decide on appropriate
treasure types (see Placing Treasure, DCB). For example,
a large, successful bandit gang might have a hoard of C7
+ R11 + M9 in their hidden camp in the wild.

Adventuring Parties
Parties of adventurers who may be encountered in the wilds of Dolmenwood.
Adventuring Party Generation Procedure
1. Party size: 1d4+4 characters.
2. Party Level: Most adventuring parties are of low Level
(1d3). 1-in-6 parties are of higher Level (1d6+3).
3. Kindred and Class: For each character in the party,
roll on the Adventurer Kindred and Adventurer Class
by Kindred tables.
4. Character Level: For each character in the party, roll
1d3 or 1d6+3 to determine their Level.
5. Spells: For each spell-caster in the party, choose or roll
their memorised spells.
6. Equipment: Characters have normal adventuring gear.
The randomised Class equipment in the Dolmenwood
Player’s Book may be used, if desired.
7. Treasure: The party has the following shared among
them: 1d100cp, 1d100sp, 1d100gp, 10% chance of 1d4
gems, 10% chance of 1d4 art objects.
8. Magic items: Each character in the party has a chance
of possessing a magic item from each of the following
categories (DCB): magic armour, magic ring, magic
weapon, potion, rod / staff / wand (for spell-casters),

scroll / book (for spell-casters), wondrous item. The
chance per category is 5% per Level of the character.
Rolled items that cannot be used by the character
should be ignored (no re-roll).
9. Mounts: When encountered on a road or in settled
areas, there is a 75% chance of the party being mounted,
typically on riding horses.
10. Alignment: Roll on the Alignment table per character
or once for the whole party.
11. Names and other details: Roll on the tables in the
Kindreds section of the Dolmenwood Player’s Book,
as desired.
12. Marching order: Determine as makes sense given the
types of characters in the party.
13. Quest: Optionally, roll on the Quest table appropriate
to the party’s alignment (or the dominant alignment
of the characters).

Rolling Adventuring Parties in Advance
As the procedure for generating NPC adventuring parties
is fairly involved, the Referee may wish to generate some
NPC parties in advance for use in random encounters.

Creating Monsters
Guidelines for inventing new foes to confound even the most seasoned adventurer.

I

nventing new monsters is one of the most creative and fun aspects of the game for the Referee.
New monsters keep the game fresh for players
and enhance the specific flavour of adventure scenarios.
Creating new monsters is an exercise of imagination,
rather than one of following rules or formulae for what
is allowed or balanced. The procedure presented here is a
guide to the Referee, rather than a set of hard and fast rules
as to what is possible.
Monsters and PCs are built with different rules: It is
very important to note that monsters are not built using
the same rules as PCs. They do not have Classes and Level
progressions. They do not have Ability Scores. This greatly
simplifies monster creation.

1. Imagine

The first and most important step is to imagine the
monster. A strong mental picture makes it easy to determine a monster’s stats and combat capabilities in the
subsequent steps. Consider the following.
Appearance: What basic shape is the monster (humanoid,
worm, avian, insect, etc.)? How large is it? Is it made of flesh
and blood or something else (fungus, ooze, plants, crystal, metal, fire, ice, darkness, etc.)? What covers its surface
(slime, fur, scales, feathers, spines, etc.)? What colour is it?
How many limbs / heads / tails does it have?
Origin: Is the monster a biological organism (naturally
occurring or bred)? Is it undead? Is it a fairy or demi-fey? Is
it constructed or summoned by magic?
Intelligence and behaviour: Is the monster of animal,
human-level, or greater intelligence? What does it
consume? Does it value treasure (or other special items
or substances)? What does it crave? How does it react to
encounters with adventurers?
Environment: Does the monster live underground or on
the surface (or both)? Does it favour one type of terrain or
environment? Does it build lairs or wander?
Society: Is the monster solitary or does it live in groups?
How does it interact with others of its kind? What kind
of social structure does it have? Do its leaders have any
special powers?

2. Level

Modifying Existing Monsters
Before starting to create a wholly new monster,
consider whether a few small modifications to an existing monster could have the desired effect.
Re-skinning: The stats and special traits of an existing monster can often be reused, simply altering its
descriptive and behavioural qualities. For example,
the standard giant leech stat block could be used for a
vampiric “blood hound.”
Tweaking: Similarly, variant monsters are easily
created by making a few alterations to an existing
monster, adding breath weapons, web spinning, wings,
extra limbs, multiple heads, etc. Remember to adjust
the monster’s XP value if it gains special traits.

3. Combat Stats
Descriptors
Based on the picture of the monster established in Step 1,
determine the following.
Size: Small, Medium, or Large.
Type: Animal, Bug, Construct, Demi-Fey, Dragon, Fairy,
Fungus, Monstrosity, Mortal, Ooze, Plant, or Undead.
Intelligence: Mindless, Animal Intelligence, Semi-Intelligent, Sentient, or Genius.
Alignment: Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic.

Hit Points
Monsters usually have 1d8 Hit Points per Level. For
example, a Level 3 monster has 3d8 HP. Very weak Level 1
monsters may occasionally have 1d4 or less HP.

Armour Class
Decide what AC the monster has. Most monsters have AC
in the range of 10–16. Very few monsters have higher than
AC 19. Consider the following.
Toughness: Armour, thick hide, or scales grant higher AC.
Magic: Enchanted or innately magical monsters may have
a higher AC than their physical toughness would indicate.
Agility: Especially fast-moving or dexterous monsters may
have a higher AC.

Level is a fundamental gauge of how dangerous a monster
is. Characters of equal Level will be roughly evenly matched
in combat, taking the number of combatants into account.
For example, a group of six Level 1 PCs are fairly matched
against three Level 2 monsters.

Level: Monsters of higher Level tend to have higher AC as
a factor of game balance, making them challenging foes
for higher Level characters.

Physical size: Broadly speaking, smaller monsters are of
lower Level and larger monsters are of higher Level.

The monster’s Attack and Save Targets are determined by
its Level. See the Monster Stats By Level table.

126

Attack and Save Targets

Part Thr ee | Appendices

Speed
Decide what Speed the monster has. Most monsters have
Speed in the range of 20–60. A few monsters move more
slowly (or even not at all) and some very rare monsters
may move much more quickly, up to Speed 120. Consider
the following.
Locomotion: Monsters with more than two legs (e.g.
horses) tend to move more quickly.
Agility: Ungainly monsters may have a slower Speed, while
those with lightning reflexes may have a faster Speed.

Morale
Decide what Morale the monster has. Most monsters
have Morale in the range of 6–9. Mindless monsters (e.g.
undead) usually have Morale 12, meaning that they never
retreat or surrender.

4. Attacks

Decide what attacks the monster has. Most monsters attack
once per Round, either with a weapon or a natural attack
(e.g. bite, claw, butt). Some monsters attack multiple times
per Round with different attack forms (e.g. two claw attacks
and one bite attack per Round). Monsters with more than
three attacks per Round are rare and very dangerous.
Damage per attack: Attacks normally inflict 1d4, 1d6, or
1d8 damage. Very large monsters may inflict more damage.

5. Special Traits

Decide what special traits the monster has. Some of
the most memorable monsters have extra capabilities
beyond simply making Attack and Damage Rolls. Flaming
breath, incorporeality, immunity to mundane weapons,
spell-casting, and venomous bites are some classic examples, but anything the Referee can imagine is possible. See
Special Traits and Bonus XP for some examples.

6. XP Award

The base Experience Point award for defeating a monster
is based on its Level. Each special trait that makes the
monster more dangerous or more difficult to defeat in
combat (see Special Traits) then adds an XP bonus, also
based on the monster’s Level. See the Monster Stats By
Level table.

Special Traits and Bonus XP
What exactly constitutes a special trait for the purposes
of XP awards requires some judgement. In general, if
a special trait makes the monster more dangerous or
more difficult to defeat in combat, then it is counted for
XP purposes. The traits listed below all usually apply.
Animate servitor, Area attack form, Automatic damage,
Charge or swoop (double damage), Charm, Combination
attacks (e.g. bear hug), Dazzling or hypnotism, Death
magic, Destroy or steal equipment, Disease, Grapple,
Hit Point or Ability Score drain, Immune to mundane
weapons, Incorporeal, Magic Resistance or reflection,
Memory loss, Multiple attacks (4+ attacks per Round),
Petrification or paralysis, Place curse, Poison, Regeneration (1+ HP per Round), Return from death, Spell casting
(per 2 Ranks of spells), Steal form, Swallow whole, Trample or stampede, Victims cannot be raised.

Example: A Level 4 monster with a venomous bite and the
power to charm characters (2 special traits) has an XP value
of 180 (80 + 50 + 50).

7. Final Details
Encounters

Treasure

Decide how many individuals are usually encountered
together, determined by the monster’s social structure.
Encounter numbers of 1d4 to 2d10 are common. Small,
weak creatures tend to band together, while large, powerful monsters tend to live in smaller groups.

Hoard: Decide what treasures may be present in the
monster’s lair (whether deliberately collected or on the
bodies of victims). See Placing Treasure, DCB.

Possessions: Decide whether the monster carries treasure
on its person or has any valuable body parts (e.g. tusks).

Setting Conception

Dolmenwood was originally conceived by Gavin Norman
and Greg Gorgonmilk in 2013. It was partially developed in
the Wormskin zine (2015–2018), before being fully realised
in the Dolmenwood Player’s Book, Dolmenwood Campaign
Book, and Dolmenwood Monster Book.

Inspiration

Thanks to the originators of early Dungeons & Dragons—
Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson, John Eric Holmes, Tom Moldvay, Steve Marsh, Dave Cook, Frank Mentzer—upon whose
work the rules of Dolmenwood are founded.

Introduction
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
The Fungus That Came To Blackeswell is an adventure set in Dolmenwood,
detailing the ill-fated village of Blackeswell, deep in the woods, shortly after a
fungal apocalypse has hit.

REQUIRED BOOKS
The Referee requires the Dolmenwood core books (Player’s Book, Campaign Book,
and Monster Book) to run this adventure. The following acronyms are used when
referring to the core books:
DPB: The Dolmenwood Player’s Book.
DCB: The Dolmenwood Campaign Book.
DMB: The Dolmenwood Monster Book.

CHARACTER LEVELS 2–4
This adventure is suitable for PCs of Level 2–4. A total of approximately 33,000gp
worth of monetary treasure is present. Magic items and new fungi are also listed with
their gp value, and many common and rare fungi (DPB and DCB) are present. Selling
magic items and fungi for their full value is generally very difficult, and they do not
grant XP (unless using the optional XP for magic items rule—see Awarding XP, DCB).

LOCATION AND CONNECTIONS
This adventure takes place in the village of Blackeswell, in hex 1604. While the
adventure does feature a number of characters and powers detailed in the DCB,
no prior knowledge of them or the village itself is required to run it. A myriad of
Dolmenwood fungi detailed in the DPB and DCB also appear in the scenario; please
refer to the core books for their values and effects.

Important Note
The opening premise for this adventure is the complete destruction of Blacke­
swell. Successful completion of the adventure could enable its resettlement, but
only as a place substantially altered from its description in the DCB. If the adventure is placed into an ongoing campaign, the Referee should be prepared for the
consequences of this.

Referee’s Background
BLACKESWELL
An isolated, backwater village in Mulchgrove, the fungal forest region in eastern
Dolmenwood.
Construction: Finely-built houses and
stores, slowly falling into disrepair.
The Blacke: Sits beside a stagnant, siltchoked pool called the Blacke.
Decline: In decline these past 200 years,
ever since its source of wealth—a rich
underground vein of the rare Hag Iron
(see p8)—was exhausted.
Population: Dwindled to some 90 souls.
Full info: See the DCB for full details on
the village and its history.

JOHANNIS KLEPP,
ARTIFICER
Inventor, tinkerer, and member of the
Royal Institute, through which he came
to be associated with Paronax.
Artificer: Creator of magically-enhanced mechanical devices.
Clockworkers: Able to build programmable humanoid servitors called clockworkers (see p20).
Collaborations with Paronax: Most
recently on the fungal-brained Mycotaur
(see Area 7D and Area 34), an improved
and autonomous clockworker.

THE MYCONOM

THE MYCONOM
HYPOTHESIS

An age-old Wood God, taking the form of
a boundless fungal network beneath the
soil of all Dolmenwood. All fungi of the
wood are its eyes and ears.

Paronax’s research led him to a revolutionary hypothesis: that immortality
could be obtained by integrating fibrils
of the Myconom into one’s body.

Vast, alien intelligence: Aloof from and
indifferent to the doings of mortals.

Experimental fungi: Paronax needed to
cultivate large quantities of specialised
fungi to use in experiments testing this
hypothesis.

Perspective: Views time on a scale of
aeons.
Senses: Can sense and speak through
sentient fungal beings.

THE WIZARD PARONAX
An elderly, powerful magician of the
Royal Institute of Physicks and Sorcerers
(DCB), in Castle Brackenwold.
Fungal expert: An authority on fungi
and fungus-based magic.
Obsession: His own mortality and finding a magical means to transcend it.
Knows of the Myconom: As immortal
fungal entity spread throughout Dolmenwood. Not aware of it as conscious entity.

4

Mulchgrove base: He selected the
fungus-ridden Mulchgrove as the perfect
site for this project, and the isolated
Blackeswell as the perfect base.
Aided by Klepp: He enlisted the aid of
Klepp and his mechanical servitors in
the venture. The promised incentive:
immortality for Klepp.

EXPERIMENTS IN
BLACKESWELL

THE FUNGUS COMES
TO BLACKESWELL

Klepp arrived first in Blackeswell, buying an old warehouse for his workshop
and quarters. Paronax followed later,
making his home in an abandoned granary he purchased.

The spores took root, blossoming into
fungal structures and creatures that
overran the village in the course of a
single evening.

Secret mine labs: With the help of
Klepp’s clockworkers, the pair secretly
constructed a laboratory and gardens
of test fungi in the abandoned Hag Iron
mines beneath the village.
Experiments: Paronax set to work, tirelessly experimenting in the lab while the
clockworkers tended to the gardens and
assisted in menial tasks.
The Mycotaur: The pair also produced
a prototype of their Mycotaur design,
which came to work alongside Paronax.

THE MYCONOM INVOKED
After long experimentation, Paronax
became convinced of the validity of his
hypothesis. The time had come to summon the Myconom.
Invocation: In the subterranean laboratory, Paronax invoked eldritch fungal
magicks, calling forth the tendrils of the
immortal Wood God.
Immortality: Paronax achieved “immortality”, but not in the way he had
intended—the Myconom’s invading
fibrils transformed him into a fungal
monstrosity, an extension of itself.
The Myconom activated: Its instinctual
desire to grow activated, the Myconom
used Paronax to emit clouds of spores,
which puffed up from the mine into the
unsuspecting village above.

Mycelial veil: A thick, white veil (p8)
grew over the entire village.
Fungal monsters: A cavalcade of abominable fungal entities swarmed through
the streets and houses.
Villagers’ fate: Most villagers were
either slain (including Klepp), absorbed,
or turned into spore-infested thralls to
the Myconom (p4).
Blackeswell today: A surreal garden
of capricious death and wild, untrammelled rebirth.

HOLY FIRE APPROACHES
Word of this apocalypse reached the ears
of the authorities in Castle Brackenwold.
Sanctus Primus: The leader of the Pluritine Church’s militant evil-hunting order
of St Faxis has decided to take action.
The purge: Believing the fungal infestation to be rooted in dark magic, he is
sending a group of clerics and soldiers
to purge Blackeswell by putting the
village and its inhabitants to the torch
of cleansing, holy fire.

Time Limit
Sanctus’s troops will reach the village
within 2–3 days of the PCs’ arrival.
When troops arrive: See Epilogue
(p50) for ensuing events.
Adjusting: The Referee can adjust
this time limit as desired.

Hooks
ARCANE RESCUE
AND RETRIEVAL
The PCs are contacted by the Royal
Institute of Physicks and Sorcerers in
Castle Brackenwold. If they agree to
a meeting, they are brought before
Professor Edwynne Woglemain (DCB),
the head of the college.
Woglemain informs them that two of the
Institute’s eminent members, the wizard
Paronax and the artificer Klepp, are
trapped in the remote village of Blacke­
swell. The Institute’s spies have it that
some sort of plague has taken hold there.
Woglemain offers the following: 1,500gp
for the return of Paronax, 1,500gp for the
return of Klepp, 1,000gp for Paronax’s experimental notes, and 1,000gp for Klepp’s
experimental notes.

PLUNDER
The PCs hear rumours about what
has transpired in Blackeswell. Various
opportunities for looting present themselves to those of a resourceful nature
(and questionable moral fibre).
The heyday of the village may have
passed, but plenty of riches and treasures remain. At least one magician
resides in the village; surely their arcane
items and knowledge are free for the taking. Lastly, within the infestation must
surely lie many rare and precious fungi.
Note: This is a hook best suited for
Neutral or Chaotic parties.

ERRAND OF MERCY
The PCs are approached by an agent of
the Pluritine Church who promises great
reward for an “errand of mercy”. Should
they express interest, they are invited to
a private dining room at The Bitter Rose
inn (DCB) at Castle Brackenwold. There,
they are met by a hooded man who sits
at the opposite end of a long table.
The man states that a “mysterious,
possibly evil fungal plague” has overrun
the remote village of Blackeswell. A note
of genuine concern in his voice, the man
says that a “militant group” within the
Church plans to destroy the village and
all its inhabitants imminently, and the
PCs should make haste.
The PCs are tasked with rescuing any
survivors—including the sick and ailing—and bringing them to the Refuge of
St Keye (hex 1307). The man offers 500gp
per survivor, and asks that this mission
be kept secret from the Church.

What’s Really Happening
The hooded figure is Abbot Nedwynne
Hargle (DCB). Hargle believes that Sanctus
Primus is bloodthirsty and unforgiving in
his zeal to purge the village (see Holy Fire
Approaches, p5), and that all villagers
are deserving of mercy and compassion.
Successful PCs are met at the Refuge by
an undisguised Hargle, who makes good
on his reward, and also sees to curing
any infested villagers. The consequences
of Sanctus Primus learning of the mission are at the Referee’s discretion.

Village of Blackeswell
GENERAL NOTES
Shops and Residences

Mycelial Veil

Finely built structures, many two storeys
in height. The church (Area 18) towers
above all. Everything is swathed in a
thick, dreary white shroud (see Mycelial
Veil), and no movement can be seen.
The air is pungent with spores and rot.

Soggy, rubbery, corpse-white fungal tendrils carpet the entire village. Some are
as thick as human arms, others as fine as
hair. They slowly but surely writhe and
grow, forming a sticky, squelchy presence underfoot.

Human Inhabitants

Damaging: Any damage quickly regenerates, unless the link to the Myconom
has been severed (see Epilogue, p50).

The locals have pallid skin with a
distinct greenish tinge visible under
candlelight. This is due to their
consumption of the stinking, green
water of the Blacke (Area 29).

Hag Iron
A rare metal formerly mined in Blacke­
swell. Has curative properties when
crafted into jewellery: a person adorned
with at least 250gp of the stuff gains a +2
bonus to Saving Throws against disease.

8

Sundry Moulds and Fungi
Most locations in the village are covered
in mould, rot, fungus, and lichen of various kinds. Some of these have special
effects if eaten or interacted with, noted
in the area description. Otherwise, treat
them as inedible (disgustingly slimy,
bitter, etc.) but not poisonous.

RANDOM EVENTS (1-in-6 Chance Every Turn)
1

2d4 mycelipods (p11) rear up from the blanketing veil and lash out at the party.

2

All village fungi release their spores as one, creating captivating, many-hued
clouds that transfix fungal monsters. The next monsters encountered ignore
the PCs unless aggravated.

3

A procession of 4d4 lichenthropic dead (p11) staggers towards the church
(Area 18). If it is nighttime, they radiate a pallid, spectral bioluminescence. If left
in peace, they pray quietly on the steps, otherwise their hunger for flesh kicks in.

4

A 5′ pinkish stalk, thick as a log, abruptly sprouts from the mycelial veil. It
opens a ragged slash of a mouth, repeats “get out” in Mulch for 2 minutes, then
topples and decays.

5

Father Bertil (p10) approaches, anointing mushroom patches with oil and
uttering Liturgic blessings. He seems to have given names to some.

6

PCs kick up a cloud of eye-stinging spores. All must Save Versus Blast or suffer
–1 to Attack Rolls for 2 Turns.

7

3 drunken mosslings (DMB) sampling the village’s fungi. They recline under a 6′
red mushroom and guzzle milky white fluid drained from a spigot in the stipe.

8

A fibrous protuberance resembling a lupine head sprouts from the side of a
building. It emits a brief, piteous howl, eliciting similar replies from the surrounding woods.

9

Sylvain Aster (Area 6) blithely strides past, on his way to the grocer (Area 22)
to pick up “a snack for Mr Buttons”. He greets PCs, philosophically lamenting
“the village’s decline of late”.

10 A thick cloud of fungal spores drifts to ground nearby. Small fungal blooms
manifest almost immediately.
11 Kerth Goodwine rings the church bell (see Area 18C), causing 2d6+4 infested
villagers to run wailing through the streets for 1 Turn, accosting PCs if they are
not soon indoors.
12 Fungal tendrils tipped with jelly ears and eye-like orbs rise from the mycelial
veil, observe PCs, then recede.

COMMON ENCOUNTERS
Father Ingram Bertil,
Vicar of Blackeswell
An ageing, frizzy-haired human man
with bent spectacles and bristling white
eyebrows. His visage is pockmarked with
tiny toadstools. His vestments are tattered and streaked with colourful slime.
Reaction: Overjoyed at visitors’ arrival.
Speech: Loudly professed gibberish:
half Pluritine Church dogma, half
mushroom-induced nonsense.
Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: His missing icon, lost since
before “the Great Bloom” (currently hidden in Area 12E). If the icon is returned
to him, he divulges the healing properties and potential risks of the “Holy
Boletus” (the mushroom in Area 14).

5′/10′/15′) Speed 30 Morale 9 XP 35
Oil: Bertil’s ampulla of spore-infested oil can be thrown once only. A
non-fungal target hit successfully
must Save Versus Doom or sprout
itchy mushrooms. They suffer a –1 to
Attack Rolls until the growths are removed, through either Cure Affliction
or cauterization (inflicts 1d8 damage).

10

Infested Villagers
Humans overrun with fungus, erupting
from their joints, nostrils, ears, and eyes.
Cunning, slavering and irrational. Seek
to bring uninfested persons before the
Fungal Father (Area 15A).

Curing: Cure Affliction, or the ingestion of Fishfop’s Ale (p22), renders
an infested villager comatose for
1d6 days, after which they awaken
heavily scarred but fungus-free.

Lichenthropic Dead

Mycelipod

Corpses of long-deceased villagers
animated by invasive fungus produced
by the Grave Fungus (Area 20). Tendrils
of mould move their bones, mycotic
growths mimic erstwhile organs, and
leprous clumps of lichen blossom in
their skulls. Crave living flesh.

Long, white fungal tendrils tipped with
sharp hooks and wicked grippers.

Lichenthropic Dead

Level 2 AC 10 HP 2d8 (9) Saves D12
R13 H14 B15 S16 Att Claw (+1, 1d6) or
spore pod Speed 20 Morale 11 XP 35
Spore pods: Lichenthropic dead
have two small spore pods growing
in place of internal organs. Each can
be thrown once at a target within 30′,
blasting them with irritant spores.
The victim must Save Versus Blast or
choke for 1d3 Rounds, unable to act,
and be rendered mute for 3d4 Turns.

Mycelipod

Small Fungus | Mindless | Neutral
Level 1 AC 10 HP 1d8 (4) Saves D12
R13 H14 B15 S16 Att Hooks (+0, 1d4

Morale 11 XP 15
Infestation: If a mycelipod’s Attack
Roll is a natural 20, or exceeds the
target’s Armour Class by 4 or greater,
the victim must Save Versus Hold.
Failure indicates the mycelipod has
latched onto their head, infesting
their mind and turning them against
their companions. This persists until
the mycelipod is killed.

Fungal: Despite their appearance,
they are not truly undead.

Regenerative Orifice
The orifice closes around anyone
who steps inside. Calculate the percentage of Hit Points the character
has remaining, compared to their
maximum. (e.g. 10 HP remaining
with maximum 15 HP = 66%.) This is
the percentage chance that the bolete
accepts the character.
Accepted: The character heals 1d6
HP per Turn. When healed to full HP,
they are gently expelled from the orifice, covered in sticky, white liquid.
Rejected: The bolete begins digesting
the character, who takes 1d3 damage
per Round. They can only be freed if
cut out of the bolete (destroying it).

GENERAL NOTES

Shroomlights

Tunnel Structure
Tunnels are hewn from limestone, with
heavy wooden timbers supporting the
ceiling at 10′ intervals.

Opaque gas bubbles formed from
gases of rotting mushrooms. Shifting
colours play across their surfaces.
Feed on the psychic residue of living
creatures’ pain.

Natural Caverns

Sm. Monstrosity | Mindless | Neutral

Several chambers are natural caverns in
the limestone. They have been cleared
of stalactites, stalagmites, and other
natural features.

Mycelial Veil
Walls are barely visible beneath a thick,
rubbery web of chalk-white mycelia.

Environment
No lighting unless noted. Air is stale
and humid. Fungal spores dance in the
torchlight.

Level 1 AC 10 HP 1d8 (4) Saves D12
R13 H14 B15 S16 Att Light ray (range
30′) Fly 40 Morale 10 XP 15
Approaching: When approached
(within 20′), a shroomlight begins to
glow and swirl with shifting colours.
After 1d4 Rounds, it is able to use its
light ray attack once per Round.
Light rays: A kaleidoscopic stream of
light fired at a single target. The target
must Save Versus Ray or suffer 1d4
damage and uncontrollably attack the
nearest living creature for 1d4 Rounds.

RANDOM EVENTS (1-in-6 Chance Every Turn)
1

1d3 shroomlights drift towards PCs.

2

A spasm runs through the mycelia coating the walls.

3

A clockworker (p20) staggers towards the party, armed with a shovel (1d6).

4

A distant hollow voice speaks slowly and deliberately, the words indistinguishable (this is Paronax in Area 34).

The Mines

45

30 BREACHED WALL

31 CRYSTAL POOL

Jagged breach in wall (framed by
mycelia). Recently constructed
(digging tools lie nearby).

Placid pool (crystal clear, icy cold water). Fine white fungal tendrils (extend into water, thriving). Mechan­
ical contraption (on north shore,
emanates metallic ticking sound).

Beyond the breach: A recently dug
tunnel leads to Area 26C.

34

Examining the contraption: A pump
actuated by a wind-up spring. Pumps
water from the pool via copper pipes
into the walls, where they vanish under
layers of fungi. (They run to Areas 32,
33, 34). A small metal plaque on the side
carries Klepp’s Maker’s Mark (p20).

The Mines

32 GROWING CAVERN (WEST)
2 beds of rotting fungus (wood
framed). Copper pipes and nozzles
(above beds, run from beneath
mycelia). Fine mist (sprayed
periodically from nozzles). Warm
atmosphere (humid).

3 Shroomlights

Western bed: Mottled, fist-sized puffballs, mostly rotting. 2 intact Hogscaps
(DPB) remain.

Stats: p45. HP 3, 4, 4.

Hover placidly above beds (bobbing).
Reaction: Start to glow and build up to
attack after 1d4 Rounds.

Eastern bed: Rubbery pink ear-shaped
fungi, mostly rotting, growing on rows of
logs. 4 intact Grue’s Ears (DPB) remain.

33 GROWING CAVERN (EAST)
2 orderly beds of fungus (wood
framed). Copper pipes and nozzles
(above beds, run from beneath mycelia). Fine mist (sprayed periodically
from nozzles). Warm atmosphere
(humid). Tall, 10′ diameter brass
cylinder (in niche to east).
Western bed: Carpet of orange morels.
Vaguely cinnamon odour. If eaten: subject must Save Versus Doom or perceive
a hallucinatory cacophony of voices
emanating from the wall mycelia for
1d4 Turns (–1 penalty to Attack Rolls due
to distraction).

3 Clockworkers
Tending beds (working methodically).
Carrying garden forks (gently turning
over soil).
Reaction: Appear docile, but attack PCs
from behind as they depart. Also fight if
interfered with.
Stats: p20. Wield garden forks (1d6).
HP 5, 12, 18.

Eastern bed: 12 waxy green toadstools.
Unusually cold. If eaten: copious stomach gas builds up. After 2 Turns, the
character can release it in a single great
belch. Living creatures within 15′ must
Save Versus Hold or fall unconscious
for 2 Turns. (Value: 500gp each.)
Examining the cylinder: It is a Com­
bobulator (see p19).

The Mines

47

34 FUNGAL LABORATORY
Damp cavern (redolent of must and
decay). Pulsing, twitching mycelial
fibres (leg thick, coat walls). West
metal workbench (flasks, tubes,
burettes, extinguished braziers, crucibles). East metal workbench (vats of
dead and desiccated fungi). Wooden
rack (shelves holding many vessels).

48

Examining the rack: 50 pellucidium
jars studded with rune-carved opals
(250gp each). All contain powdered
fungal hybrids. 3 are labelled “Waking
Shroom” (effect per Alchemical Tonic).
2 are labelled “Gaseous Shroom” (effect
per Vaporous Spirits). 1 is labelled
“Dreaming Shroom” (effect per Sandor’s
Phantasmal Elixir). (See Potions, DCB for
all.) The rest are inert.

The Mines

Paronax—Myconom Node
Fungal humanoid figure (grotesquely swollen). Embedded in mycelia of
north wall (fully integrated). Green­
ish-white, phosphorescent skin
(threaded with tiny white mycelia).
Distended visage (beard of mycelia).
Bulging eyes (milky). Gaping maw
(emits puffs of spores). Swollen arms
(clad in the shreds of purple robes).
Reaction: If threatened, dispatches the
Mycotaur against PCs, and attacks with
spells. Otherwise, pays no attention to PCs.

The Mycotaur
Clockworker (p20) with domed
head (transparent green eyes).
2 stinkhorn-like fungi (extend from
sides of head, like horns).
Reaction: Stands inert until commanded
by Paronax.
Gears: Body contains 10 gears usable as
ammunition for the Handgonne (p20).
Small plaque: Below left shoulder blade
(see Maker’s Mark, p20).

Mycotaur

Speech: Paronax is now a mouthpiece
of the Myconom, speaking in a hollow
monotone, in abstract, cosmic terms,
expressing neither malice nor empathy.
Asks nonsensical questions, with seemingly no interest in the responses. Ignores
any questions asked. Speaks all languages.

Lg. Construct | Semi-Int. | Neutral

Desires: To expand into the surface
region around Blackeswell, for reasons
unfathomable to mortals.

Semi-living: Fungal brain makes
the otherwise synthetic Mycotaur
susceptible to biological effects (e.g.
disease, poison) and to mind-affecting spells (e.g. Vapours of Dream,
Paralysation, Dominate).

Saving: Paronax has merged with the
Myconom and lost any separate existence; he cannot be saved.
Destroying: Ends the infestation of
Blackeswell (see Epilogue, p50).

Mycelipods: Unravel from the Mycotaur’s fungal horns.
Infestation: If a mycelipod Attack
Roll is a natural 20, or exceeds the
target’s Armour Class by 4 or greater,
the victim must Save Versus Hold.
Failure indicates the mycelipod has
latched onto their head, infesting
their mind and turning them against
their companions. This persists until
the mycelipod is severed.
Severing mycelipods: Requires a hit
with a cutting weapon inflicting 6 or
more damage.

Epilogue
CHURCH TROOPS ARRIVE
As mentioned under Holy Fire
Approaches (p5), the clerics and
soldiers of the Order of St Faxis arrive
2–3 days after the PCs. The troops consist
of 5 acolytes (Level 1 clerics—DMB) and
10 soldiers (Level 1 fighters—DMB). They
are equipped with torches and large
quantities of oil.
Upon arrival, they announce their intention to reduce the village, the fungi,
and any infested villagers to ashes.
Unless the PCs can convince the troops
that the infestation is halted, they grimly attempt to carry out this mission—
see Paronax Destroyed and Paronax
Survives for possible outcomes.
Regardless, the soldiers try to prevent
the PCs from departing with any infested
villagers (see Errand of Mercy, p6).

PARONAX DESTROYED
A reverberating pulse shudders through
the entire mycelial veil. The Myconom,
its expansion halted, indifferently disconnects from Blackeswell.
The mycelial veil turns grey and begins
to rot. It does not regenerate in the
places where it is destroyed. All fungal
monsters in the village die. Infested
villagers survive, disoriented and
belligerent, though curable (see p10).
Should the arriving troops decide to go
forward with purging the village, they
succeed. The PCs are rewarded by the
Church, at the Referee’s discretion.

50

PARONAX SURVIVES
The infestation overwhelms Blackeswell,
but spreads no further than the boundaries of the village. Should the arriving
troops attempt to purge the village, they
fail to clear the mycelial veil or defeat
the fungal beings, and depart in defeat.
After a week, the whole village becomes
a gigantic, brain-like fungal node, similar to the “upper brain” of the Myconom
in hex 1505, though significantly larger.
Surviving infested villagers remain in
the area, living a life of perpetual worship of the node, which they come to call
“Nuncle Numpkin”.

New Spells
BLAST SPORE

MYCOTIC MIND

Rank 4 arcane spell

Rank 2 arcane spell

Duration: 1 Round per Level
Range: 240′

Duration: 12 Turns
Range: Fungus touched

A slimy cluster of fungal spores appears
at a chosen point within range.

Enchants a fungus with the power to
connect to the caster’s mind, relaying the
senses of a subject who eats the fungus.

Trigger: At any time within the duration, the caster can mentally command
the spores to explode.
Expiration: If not already triggered, the
spores explode automatically when the
duration ends.
Explosion: The spores explode in a 20′
radius blast. Creatures caught in the
blast suffer 2d6 damage, with a successful Save Versus Blast indicating
half damage. Those who fail the save
must also Save Versus Doom or choke,
suffering an additional 1d6 damage for 6
subsequent Rounds.

Subject: A living creature that consumes
the fungus in its entirety must Save Ver­
sus Spell or have their senses relayed
to the caster for the remainder of the
duration.
Sensory relay: The caster perceives
everything the subject sees and hears, in
place of their own sensory inputs. While
receiving senses, the caster is unable to
move or act.
Cancelling: The caster may cancel the
spell at will.

SPORE CLOUD
Rank 1 arcane spell
Duration: Instant
Range: 60′
A cloud of sickly, yellow mould spores
erupts at a chosen point within range.
Area: The cloud fills a 10′ radius area.
Effect: All creatures within the cloud
must Save Versus Blast or cough and
choke for 1d4 Rounds. Victims are unable to attack, speak, or perform coherent
actions. They may stagger and crawl at
half Speed.
Restrictions: Non-living creatures (e.g.
undead, constructs) are not affected.

F

ungal apocalypse has ravaged the isolated village of
Blackeswell, blanketing the streets in blanched mycelia waving eerily to an unheard hymn. The village is to
be razed to the ground, but the bold may be able to get in and
out before the troops arrive. Can any living souls be saved and
can the fungal infestation be reversed?
The Fungus That Came to Blackeswell is an adventure of fungal
horror designed for characters of Level 2–3. Presented in a
quick-reference format, the adventure is easy to run with
minimal prep.
Referees also need the Dolmenwood core books.

Introduction
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
The Ruined Abbey of St Clewyd is an
adventure set in Dolmenwood, detailing
the accursed ruins of the once famed
Abbey of St Clewyd. This adventure
takes Player Characters on a treacherous, fraught expedition into the ruined
abbey, from the peaks of its fallen spires
to the depths of its haunted crypts. Once
the crown jewel of the Pluritine Church’s
dominance of the Wood, the abbey has
lain abandoned for a century, the victim
of a mysterious cataclysm. Riches and
danger await within.

REQUIRED BOOKS
The Referee requires the Dolmenwood core books (Player’s Book, Campaign Book,
and Monster Book) to run this adventure. The following acronyms are used when

CHARACTER LEVELS 4–6
This adventure is suitable for PCs of Level 4–6. Several monsters in the adventure can
only be harmed by silver or magic weapons. A total of approximately 54,000gp worth
of monetary treasure is present. Magic items are also listed with their gp value. Selling magic items for their full value is generally very difficult, and they do not grant
XP (unless using the optional XP for magic items rule—see Awarding XP, DCB).

LOCATION AND CONNECTIONS
This adventure is located in hex 0906, greatly expanding the material described for
that hex in the DCB. The events in the History section of the DCB, particularly those
from 350 years ago to the present day, strongly tie into this adventure’s background.
The abbey has significance for two major factions described in the DCB: the Pluritine
Church and Atanuwë, the Nag-Lord. As such, the Referee could use this adventure
as part of a wider campaign arc involving one or both factions. In addition, the NPCs
and plot elements appearing in the Bell Tower location (Area 3) connect directly to
Lady Theatrice Harrowmoor (DCB). See Hooks, p6 for more ideas on integrating
the abbey into an ongoing campaign.

Referee’s Background
Sallowbryg,
Spawn of Atanuwë
400 years ago, the Chaos godling Atanuwë arrived in Dolmenwood and sought
to spread its corrupting influence.
The Atacorns: Cruel, unicorn-like
offspring of Atanuwë, sent out into the
world to corrupt mortals.
Sallowbryg: The vilest Atacorn: a scarlet
unicorn, sowing disease, discord, and
warfare in many lands.

St Clewyd and Sallowbryg
The revered living saint, Clewyd, swore
to bring the wicked Sallowbryg to justice.
Battle: St Clewyd followed the trail of
the Atacorn to the heart of Dolmenwood,
where he battled the beast.
The Atacorn defeated: After an exhausting, titanic battle, Sallowbryg collapsed and expired before the bloodied,
weakened Clewyd.
Soul escape: A rippling tear in the fabric
of reality opened before Clewyd, revealing infernal vistas beyond. Sallowbryg’s
soul leapt from its mangled corpse, cackling in mockery as it fled through the Rift.
Desperate prayer: St Clewyd petitioned
the One True God, laying down his own
soul, swearing to pursue Sallowbryg into
this hellish realm and vanquish it there.
Saint and monster bound: With a
bolt of lightning, Clewyd’s essence was
stripped from his body and hurled into
the rift. He engaged the beast once more,
and soon the two became bound together, locked in eternal combat in a dismal
dimension of Chaos.

4

Years of the Abbey
The saint’s disciples came upon the
lifeless bodies of the saint and unicorn.
Grief-stricken, they vowed to construct a
great abbey at the site of Clewyd’s death,
to inter his body and relics.
The abbey completed: 50 years later,
the Abbey of St Clewyd was completed.
A group of monks came to reside there,
founding an order that, over time, became traditionally all-male.
Crowning glory of the Church: The
complex symbolised the Pluritine
Church’s conquest of Dolmenwood.

Lummingwyll,
The Last Abbot
100 years ago (two centuries after the
abbey’s founding), an ambitious new
abbot devised a fateful plan.
Abbot Lummingwyll: An erudite, prideful, and vainglorious man who wished to
increase his power and standing within
the Church.
Communion with the dead: After years
of studying confiscated occult texts, Abbot
Lummingwyll found a means to his goal:
an arcane ritual to consult with the spirit
of one deceased. Lummingwyll believed
he could harness this magic to provide
(and control) access to the lost saint.

The Abbey’s Destruction
Lummingwyll and his closest acolytes
performed the ritual of communion at
a sacred pool in the abbey’s crypts (see
Area 32).
Disaster: The abbot’s haste, overconfidence, and inexperience with matters
arcane caused the ritual to go awfully
wrong.
The Chaos Rift: The dimensional rupture through which the souls of Sallowbryg and Clewyd left this plane was rent
open once more.
Destruction: A roiling shockwave of
chaotic energy blasted out, demolishing
much of the abbey above, unleashing
monstrous beings into the crypts below,
and killing most of the monks.
Clewyd/Sallowbryg hybrid: The bound
spirits of the saint and the Atacorn
were dragged through the Rift, physically manifesting as a monstrous man/
unicorn hybrid—a twisted, deranged
amalgam of Clewyd and Sallowbryg.

The Order of Wardens
Lummingwyll and 7 other surviving
monks sealed themselves inside the
western crypts, imprisoning the twisted
St Clewyd/Sallowbryg along with them.
The Sollemitaine: The monks swore an
oath—the “Sollemitaine”—to guard the
creature until its death or cure, sparing
the outside world the sight of this blasphemous, pitiful horror. The being, now their
responsibility, came to be known as “the
Charge”. Thus was born the Order of Wardens and their strange, subterranean life.
Trapped without help: The Chaos Rift
continued to ravage the abbey’s ruins,
trapping the monks. No help came from
the surface; investigators were repelled
by the dangers of the site. The Pluritine
Church declared the abbey forbidden.
The dead rise: Driven by the weird
energies of the Rift, the monks interred
in the abbey’s central crypt (Area 30)
emerged from their tombs—either
miraculously resurrected or reanimated
as undead. The resurrected came to join
the Order, growing its numbers. The
undead haunt the crypts still.

The Abbey Today
In recent months, the Nag-Lord has used
the nearby ley line Lamm to syphon chaotic energies from the Rift, to empower
its armies further. This has rendered the
abbey relatively approachable for the
first time in a century.
Surface ruins: The ruins are looted, abandoned, and beset with weird energies.
Eastern crypts: The Chaos Rift still rages, making the eastern half of the crypts
perilous.
Western crypts: The Order of Wardens
dwells here in relative safety, guarding
the Charge, who remains deranged and
warped.

Hooks
THE LOST CROWN
PCs come into possession of ancient
Liturgic documents detailing the fate
of the fabled crown of Prince Gaspar
of Brackenwold, believed lost for
900 years. They reveal that in his old
age, Gaspar had gifted his crown in
secret to the Pluritine Church. The
crown was then locked away in the
vaults of the bishop’s palace in Castle
Brackenwold for many centuries.
Upon the completion of the abbey of St
Clewyd, the crown was secretly transferred to a vault in the abbey’s crypts,
along with several relics. (See Area 39.)

PCs are tasked to venture into the ruins,
investigate the source of the strange
energies, and attempt to recover any
remaining relics. Successful PCs are
appointed as leaders of a sect responsible for warding any retrieved artefacts.
They are granted four followers (Level 1
clerics) and funds to construct a shrine
in a settlement of their choosing.

VISIONS OF THE PROPHET
A religious or magically sensitive PC
receives a vision purporting to be from
the spirit of St Clewyd.

Investigation reveals that the crown is
recognisable by its Old Woldish inscription: “VICTORY, DOMINION, PIETY”. It is
also revealed that the Dukes of Brackenwold believe the crown lost and would
greatly value its return (4,000gp).

The saint reveals that his spirit was
trapped during the destruction of the
abbey. He tasks the PC with venturing
into the abbey’s crypts, opening his
tomb, and releasing him so that he may
ascend to heaven. In the vision, Clewyd
promises the PC renown, the blessing of
the One True God, and inheritance of his
personal prayer book, the Gnomon.

HOLY RELICS

What’s Really Happening

Investigation

PCs affiliated with the Pluritine Church
are contacted (for example by Abbot
Hargle or Sanctus Primus, DCB) with a
sensitive mission.
Since the recent abatement of the dangerous energies that wrack the ruined
abbey, reports speak of bands of crookhorns snooping around the site. Church
authorities fear that Atanuwë seeks the
lost relics believed to lie in the abbey’s
crypts, or perhaps wishes to harness the
strange energies of the site.

6

The vision is an emanation of the monster known as the Charge (see Area 52).
While originally created from the combined souls of St Clewyd and Sallowbryg, the monster now sees itself as an
individual. The Charge simply seeks to
be released from its prison in the crypts.
It has no further interest in the PC.

Players’ Background
COMMON FOLKLORE
St Clewyd is a legendary, revered figure, and tales of his ultimate sacrifice
abound. They vary in detail but follow
these general themes.

St Clewyd and the Monster
The revered living saint, Clewyd, tracked
the demon Sallowbryg into the depths of
Dolmenwood, more than 3 centuries ago.
Sallowbryg: An evil scarlet unicorn,
scourge of good folk, bringer of death,
misery and disease.
Victory and death: Clewyd slew Sallowbryg, but himself sustained a mortal
wound and perished beside his foe.

Rise of the Abbey
Clewyd’s mourning followers buried
him at the site of his death and, over the
course of several decades, built a monastery on the spot, founding an order in
his name.
Abbey of St Clewyd: The greatest of
the Pluritine Church’s monasteries in
Dolmenwood.

Fall of the Abbey
A century ago, all contact with the abbey
was lost.
Pilgrims reported: The abbey had
become a desolate ruin, destroyed by
some great force, haunted by monsters,
strange phenomena, and the dead.
Reclamation attempts: The Church has
tried and failed repeatedly at reclaiming
the abbey.

Theories: Of the abbey’s fall are as
numerous as they are outlandish, with
blame placed upon the Drune, the
Nag-Lord, witches, the Cold Prince, or
internal strife.
Great treasures: Surely must remain
there, untouched.

Recent Rumours
According to travellers’ tales, the weird
phenomena and unearthly wailing
around the abbey have abated in recent
months. It is said that the ruins may
once more be safe to wander.

CHURCH KNOWLEDGE
Cleric and friar PCs possess the following additional knowledge.

The Last Abbot
The abbey’s final leader was a priest
called Lummingwyll.
Polarising figure: Considered by some
to be a motivator and doer, by others an
ambitious climber and possible heretic.

Lost Relics
The abbey’s crypts contained many great
relics.
The Epitome of Life: A bejewelled golden casket, said to contain a cloth magically formed from the rent garments of
Clewyd’s mourning followers.
The Gnomon: Clewyd’s own prayer
book, always by his side.
The Hand of St Signis: Mummified, said
to repel the dead.

The Surface Ruins
SURFACE GENERAL NOTES
Perimeter Wall

Abbey Grounds

The abbey grounds are ringed with a
hefty, dry stone wall (15′ high, 8′ thick).
The wall is largely intact, though some
stones have fallen. Three obvious entrances exist:

Cracked earth carpeted in thistles and
nettles, rising to thickets (see map).
Limestone structures dilapidated and
singed, some collapsed into rubble, with
remnants of walls. Scattered, broken
human bones and skulls. Eerie quiet.

Main gate (east): An arched gateway, its
apex fallen and its oaken doors singed
and hanging askew. A faded Chapes holy
symbol is painted on each door.
Side entrance (south): A narrow elm
wood door. Locked.
Collapsed wall (west): Jagged stone
chunks which appear to have been
blown outward from the compound.

Movement: Use the rules for dungeon
exploration (see Dungeons, DPB) when
characters are exploring the grounds
and surface ruins.

Depictions of St Clewyd
Images of St Clewyd can be found in
several areas. He is depicted with black,
curly hair and beard, wide, benevolent
eyes, and a robe of gold and silver.

GHOSTLY MONKS
Wandering spirits, unable to rest until their last wish is fulfilled. Each has a secret he
will share with PCs who help. None know the cause of the abbey’s destruction.

18 GRAVEYARD
Ivy-covered stone walls (10′ high,
crumbling, buckled by invading tree
roots). Hundreds of ancient graves
(interring lower order monks). Disturbed graves (many recently and
carelessly dug up).

18

Inspecting the gravestones: Dates indicate that no one has been buried here
for the past 100 years.
Examining the disturbed graves:
Contain shrouded, skeletal, desiccated
corpses—many missing all their teeth.

19

Charmed Child
During the day, there is a 2-in-6 chance
of one of the bedraggled children who
dwell in Area 3 being present, digging in
a grave. They flee if approached.

19 GRAVEYARD GATEHOUSE
Imposing graveyard gatehouse
(black stone, 15′ high). St Signis engravings (saint with finger to lips).
Gate hanging ajar (rusted ironwork,
creaky). Empty plinths (one at each
corner of roof, big enough for a large
object—now missing).

Entering: PCs making noise attract the
attention of the gargoyles in Area 21.
Otherwise, make a Surprise Roll for the
gargoyles to see whether they notice PCs
passing through.
Lodge doors: Arched wooden doors to
Areas 20 and 21 both hang ajar.

20 EAST LODGE
Black stone (walls, floor, ceiling 12′).
Smashed furnishings (beds, table,
chairs). 6 oil paintings (hanging
askew).
Searching the debris: Uncovers a
cherry-wood icon of St Signis inlaid with
mother-of-pearl (300gp).

20

Examining the paintings: They depict
relics in gilt display cases. One (a painting of a blackened, mummified hand
resting on an indigo pillow) appears
three-dimensional, as if one could reach
into the painting. Doing so transports a
character to Area 49.

The Surface Ruins

21 WEST LODGE
Black stone (walls, floor, ceiling 12′).
Broken workbenches (masons’ tools

Immunities: Unharmed by cold and lightning.
Adhesion: On a successful attack, the acid-oozing appendage sticks onto the
victim and inflicts 1d4 damage in subsequent Rounds. This reduces the number
of attacks per Round the redslob may make.
If hit in melee: When a redslob is hit with a melee weapon, the attacker must
Save Versus Hold. If the save fails, the weapon is ripped out of the attacker’s
hand, adhering to the monster’s sticky mass.
Wield weapons: A redslob may grasp weapons that have adhered to its surface,
wielding them in subsequent Rounds. Each weapon wielded may attack once per
Round, replacing one of the redslob’s appendage attacks.

RANDOM EVENTS (2-in-6 Chance Every Turn)
1

A Drune explorer (stats per Audrune, DMB) who has travelled here via a ley
line to investigate the effects of the Chaos Rift. If threatened, the Drune can
escape via the Chaos Rift (Area 32).

2

A lambent wisp (see opposite). Glides serenely into view from an invisible
fissure in the air. Needs 1d3 Rounds to sense PCs and attack. Once engaged, pursues any who flee.

3

Gravity is nullified for 1 Turn.

4

A warp worm (see opposite). Appears in a purple flash. Disoriented, distressed,
belligerent. Does not pursue if fled.

5

Psychedelic-hued phantoms drift from the walls, moaning silently and reaching out to attack each PC with a searing cold touch (+4, 1d4). Those struck must
Save Versus Doom or flee screaming in terror to the surface, unable to return
for 1 hour.

6

A single word echoes from a corner. Repeating it causes the thing to manifest.
Examples: “cheese” (5 rations), “goat” (one terrified animal), “discombobulated” (all PCs forget why they are here for 1 Turn).

7

An amphibious fungoid (see opposite). Sprouts and flowers before PCs’ eyes,
forming in 1d3 Rounds, and attacks.

8

Distant, solemn Liturgic hymns that gradually devolve into the braying of
beasts, before erupting into snorts of laughter and abruptly ceasing.

9

PCs’ voices are replaced by a singing church choir, for 1 Turn.

10 The nature of light is reversed for 1 Turn: dark areas are illuminated, and light
sources become pools of darkness.
11 2d4 giant frogs (DMB). Mutated by the magic waters of the crypt, seeking meat
or carrion.
12 The air shimmers; stone walls undulate. If the party does not leave the vicinity
at once, roll 1d4 for consequence: 1. An item held by a random PC is enlarged
to gargantuan proportions (20′ long / wide); 2. The PCs find themselves flat on
their backs in the pool in Area 31, surrounded by hooting and pointing animated
cherubs; 3. Two random PCs swap heads for 2 Turns; 4. The PCs find themselves
sprawled in a perfect circle around the Monument to St Clewyd (Area 16).

The Eastern Crypts

EASTERN CRYPTS GENERAL NOTES
Pervasive Magic
The Chaos Rift (Area 32) affects the
entire eastern crypts. While its effects
have lessened from the initial explosive
vortex of magical energy, its presence
continues to warp these chambers. As
a result, the whole area is riddled with
magic. Detection of magic reveals a
powerful, chaotic enchantment about
everything in this place.

Water Channels
Flow from east to west, fed by an underground stream that enters the complex
in Area 32. Unless noted, channels are 5′
wide and 3′ deep, with brisk but manageable currents. The waters are strangely
warm and slightly fizzing.

Amphibious Fungoid
8′ long, salamander-shaped monstrosities formed of webs, nodules,
and crests of vibrant, fungal matter.

Large Fungus | Mindless | Neutral

Infection: Target must Save
Versus Doom or be afflicted with
injected spores for 1 Turn (or until
the fungoid is killed). Affected
characters either attack their allies
or stand drooling (equal chance of
either per Round).

Lambent Wisp
Shreds of radiant ectoplasm, loosely formed into a 10′ diameter cloud of tendrils.

Tendrils: Inflict burning damage from the wisp’s internal heat.
Irradiate (twice a Turn): Can unleash a blast of prismatic radiation. All within
40′ must Save Versus Doom or suffer 1d12 damage and be blinded for 1 Turn.

Warp Worm
Floating pink worm, hundreds of yellow eyes along flanks. 30′ long, 5′ diameter.

Large Monstrosity | Mindless | Neutral
Level 7 AC 14 HP 7d8 (31) Saves D8 R9 H10 B11 S12
Att Bite (+6, 3d6 + swallow) or bash (+6, 1d8) Fly 50 Morale 10 XP 780
Swallow: On a bite Attack Roll of natural 19–20, a Small or Medium target is
swallowed. The victim suffers 1d6 damage per Round (until the worm dies). Swallowed victims may attack the worm with sharp weapons at a –4 Attack penalty. If
a swallowed victim dies, the worm disappears into another dimension.

The Eastern Crypts

27

30 CENTRAL CRYPT
Sandstone blocks (walls, floor).
Vaulted undercroft (30′ high). Rows
of massive pillars (limestone, supporting ceiling and chapel on surface).
Translucent pink vines (gelatinous,
dangle from ceiling, curled around
pillars). Sounds of rushing water (fill
the space, from the east—Area 31).
Doors to the surface: Twin arched,
iron-bound doors open onto spiral staircases to the ruined chapel (Area 10).

Chaotic Happenings
Heightened events: There is a 3-in-6
chance of a Random Event (p26)
occurring here each Turn.

5 Undead Abbots
Undead abbot corpses (escaped from
interment). Pale, drawn flesh (desiccated). Ceremonial robes (bloodied
and ragged). Lurking in shadows
(between the tombs and pillars).
Reaction: Wish to destroy the living, for
whom they are filled with hatred.

Tombs and Coffers
3 humble stone coffers (to the
south, older construction, unadorned, some missing lids). 5 ornate,
pompous tombs (to the north,
newer construction, daises, elaborate
scrollwork, extravagant portraiture).
Examining: All are open and empty,
with no sign of the interred.
Names: Abbot Quibbleton, Abbot
Lullingford, Abbot Shrubwick (in older,
simpler coffers); Abbot Shadwell, Abbot
Adalbert, Abbot Growedd, Abbot Pontyth, Abbot Legworth (on the newer,
more ostentatious tombs).

to mind-affecting or mind-reading spells (e.g. Vapours of Dream,
Paralysation, Dominate).
Dark sight: Can see normally without light.
Immunities: Only harmed by silver
weapons, magic, or magic weapons.
Energy drain: Touch reduces the
victim’s maximum Hit Points by 1d3
and incurs a –1 penalty to Attack
Rolls and Saving Throws. These
effects are cumulative if a victim
is touched multiple times. Gaining
a Level removes all penalties and
restores lost maximum HP.
Items: Each wears a dented, solid
gold Chapes (300gp).

32 THE CHAOS RIFT
Sandstone blocks (walls, floor).
Vaulted ceiling (15′). Dull violet
glow (illuminates room). Underground stream (enters crypts by a 5′
circular opening, ringed with broken
metal grate). Swirling pool (purple
and cyan swirl). 8 angelic statues
(5′ high, ring the pool, solid marble
seems to sway and ripple). Pool outflow (flows through wide, floor-level
aperture into Area 31). Deep humming (felt more than heard).

Chaos Rift
Swirling, purple-blackness (hovers
above pool). Profoundly opaque (yet
somehow transparent, not there at all).
Staring into the Rift: Affords fleeting
glimpses of unfamiliar, alien vistas.
Space here seems all wrong.
Touching the Rift: Any creature or
physical object touching the Rift is instantly annihilated.
Closing the Rift: Dispel Magic (versus a
Level 15 caster) closes the Rift for 1 Turn.
Throwing in The Charge (see Area 52,
dead or alive) closes it permanently, as
can a wish (see Epilogue, p52).
History: The failed ritual that ruined the
abbey took place here (see The Abbey’s
Destruction, p5). The Rift is its result.

32

Chaotic Happenings
Automatic event: A Random Event
(p26) occurs here once per Turn.

33

Encounter duration: Manifested creatures disappear after 1 Turn.

33 UNDERCROFT OF CHATTERING SKULLS
Rough-hewn walls, slathered in
living flesh (pulsing, suppurating).
Pillars of muscle and bone (support
15′ vaulted ceiling, bleeding profusely). Raw nerves (crisscross the floor).
Dozens of stone shelves (line the
walls, interspersed with flesh). Hundreds of skulls (in shelves, speaking,
clacking jaws). Maddening dissonance (skulls’ incessant chattering).

30

Entering the room: The skulls howl
with agony and glee as nerves are
stepped upon.
Searching the skulls: 17 are marked with
a red cross atop the cranium and contain
3d20gp each. Searchers have a 1-in-6
chance per Turn of finding one. Inspecting all of them takes 1 person 12 Turns.
Listening to the skulls: Amidst the
drone of theological debates, nonsensical soliloquies, and risqué ballads, the
phrase “Lummingwyll did it all, he did it
upstairs” is sporadically audible.

The Eastern Crypts

34 CRYPT JUNCTION
Sandstone blocks (walls, floor).
Vaulted ceiling (15′). Swirling pool
(fed by channel). Sickly sweet odour
(emanating from pool). Sounds
of streaming water (serene). 12
submerged corpses (bottom of pool,
10′ down, wafting in the current).
Grated pool outflow (flows through
5′ wide iron grate into Area 43).
Examining the corpses: Grotesquely
swollen and violet-hued. The remains of
a long-ago Church mission to reclaim the
Abbey, preserved and mutated by the
chaos-tainted waters. No visible wounds.
6 wear gold holy symbols of St Faxis (3
crossed swords, 75gp each). One carries
the Mercy of St Elsa.
Removing the grate: The grate is
rusty but strong. It cannot be removed
or damaged by hand. If removed by
special means, PCs may pass along the 5′
underwater channel, emerging from the
waterfall in Area 43.

Warded Doors
to Areas 40 and 41
Solid oak (iron studs). Pitted and
scratched (claw marks). Glowing
inscription (golden).
Inscription: In Liturgic: “Waxed Full, Uncast, Unfettered, Punished, Exposed, ?”.
(This refers to the mosaics in Area 9.)
Warding: A magical ward prevents passage from this side. Speaking the word
“Resurrection” nullifies the ward for 1
Turn. The inscription shimmers silver.
Locked: The doors are also locked.

Mercy of St Elsa
A silver Holy Mace, engraved with
prayers.
In battle: The wielder weeps tears of
holy water (–1 penalty to Attack Rolls,
+1d4 damage to undead).
Value: 3,750gp.

36 CISTERN
Sandstone blocks (walls, floor).
Dripping, algae-drenched ceiling
(domed, 10′). Reservoir (fills entire
floor, murky, 60′ deep). Radiant, purple glow (emanates from below the
surface). Light filters down (from 5′
wide, 60′ high shaft at ceiling apex,
leading up to the well in Area 14).
Lingering on the ledge: Summons the
attention of the catfish, who rises to the
surface to eye PCs.
Entering the reservoir: Disturbs the
catfish, causing it to lash out.
Reservoir bottom: 60′ deep. An open
drain there connects to another channel
that rejoins the underground stream
beyond the abbey complex.

The Catfish’s Vision
The vision: PCs perceive a vision
of entering the dungeons beneath
Castle Brackenwold. They see a
secret chamber wherein a stone
throne sits atop a great pedestal.
They witness the sacrifice of a young
human girl to an evil presence that
lurks within the throne.
Yearning: PCs experiencing the
vision must Save Versus Spell or
become obsessed with visiting the
secret chamber and retrieving a
souvenir for the catfish.
Returning with a souvenir: Should
such a mission succeed, the catfish
gives PCs a giant, glowing crystal
geode (4,000gp), which manifests
in a bubble blown from its lips. If
the Referee wishes, it may provide
further visions of obscure locations
in Dolmenwood.

Giant Telepathic Catfish
Curled in contemplation (at the
cistern’s base). Monstrous proportions (25′ long). Mottled skin (subterranean white and garish pink).
Bulging eyes (3′ orbs of blackness).
Branched whiskers (prehensile,
orange and mauve). Purplish glow
(suffuses body). Mind evolved (great
but abstruse intellect, wracked with
telepathic visions of Dolmenwood).
Reaction: Offers to telepathically share
a vision of a great secret with the PCs
(see The Catfish’s Vision).
Speech: Slow, echoing whisper. Can
telepathically communicate with any
sentient being.
Desires: See The Catfish’s Vision.
History: Originally a normal fish that
swam into the crypts and was awakened, mutated, and enlarged by the
chaotic energies of the Rift.

37 PASSAGE OF THE DEAD
Sandstone blocks (walls, floor).
Arched corridor (10′ ceiling). 3
mosaics (each 10′ wide, along walls,
see Mosaics).
Stairways to Area 38: Channel descends
in a small waterfall, flanked by twin
staircases. Light reflects from a large
flooded space ahead.

Mosaics
Each depicts a state of death, according
to Church doctrine. Titled in Liturgic.
A: “Torment”: Wicked mortals roasted
alive and devoured by white toad-demons.
A large section of the mosaic—shaped like
a many-tentacled serpent—is missing.
B: “Judgement”: The souls of dead mortals queue at a heavenly gate, where an
angelic figure stands holding a scale.
C: “Glory”: Exalted souls recline beside
a wondrous fountain, gazing at angels
hovering with harps.

38 THE SEVEN SISTERS
Sandstone blocks (walls, floor, ceiling
10′). Waist-high, swirling water
(floods the chamber, strangely warm).
Rotting planks and beams (drift
forlornly on the surface). Creaking
and clanking (from Shattered Wheel).
Submerged, choked drain (5′ wide
grate, channel exits the complex here).

Shattered Wheel
Dilapidated water wheel (8′ tall,
partly submerged, smashed). Thick,
rusty chains (dangle listlessly from
ceiling holes).
Pulling the chains: Opens and closes
the Doors to the Vaults. This requires a
combined Strength of 60+.

Doors to the Vaults
2 monoliths of black marble
(smooth). Featureless (no handles,
lock, or opening mechanism). Inscription (above, Liturgic “In charity, may the heart find solace”).
Opening the doors: Requires either
use of the Shattered Wheel or a clever
means of attaching a handle or rope to
the doors (and a combined Strength of
60+). Magic also works.
If opened: Unless the water is first
drained (e.g. by clearing the choked
drain), it floods into Area 39. PCs must
make a Dexterity Check or be forcibly
swept in (1d4 damage).

Wheel’s function: Originally, the water
flowing through the wheel controlled
the vault doors. It is now beyond repair.

THE ORDER OF WARDENS
Life in the Crypts
The Wardens insulate themselves from
the Chaos Rift behind warded doors. The
Sollemitaine and their shared routine
of duties and religious ritual are all that
have kept them broadly sane.
Sustenance and light: The Epitome of
Life (a Church relic, Area 44) magically produces the bread and wine upon
which the wardens subsist, and the oil to
light their chambers.
The miraculous pool: The pool in the
inner sanctum where the Wardens dwell
(Area 43) has the ability to resurrect the
dead, leading to an unending cycle of
death and rebirth.
The Afflicted Brethren: Resurrections
occasionally fail, causing deceased monks
to return as undead. Collectively referred
to as the “Afflicted Brethren”, they are
housed in cells around Area 45. Their condition ranges from semi-sentient corpses
(the “Wayward Afflicted”) to degraded,
skeletal husks (the “Silent Afflicted”). The
living monks see it as their sacred duty to
care for these stricken brothers.

Cardinites and Loyalists
There are 20 living monks today, divided
into two factions.
The Loyalists: 12 monks, including leader Abbot Lummingwyll. They believe
that the Sollemitaine is eternal.
The Cardinites: 8 monks who follow the
philosophy of the now-deceased Prior
Cardin. Led by Subprior Proster. They
believe that dying and being resurrected
has released them from the Sollemitaine,
and wish to leave the abbey.

38

The death of Cardin: Cardin claimed to
have found a secret, safe way out of the
crypts. Shortly after, his body was found
in the Cell of the Wayward (Area 46), too
mangled by its occupants for resurrection. Secretly, he was thrown to them by
the fanatical Lummingwyll.
The secret passage: A passage does
indeed lead to the surface (see Area 50),
but its existence is known only to Abbot
Lummingwyll.

Crisis of Faith
The Wardens believe that both the
Sollemitaine and the raging Chaos Rift
prevent them from leaving the crypts. To
ensure fealty, Abbot Lummingwyll keeps
knowledge of the secret exit (Area 50) to
himself. Should it become known to the
other Wardens, a crisis will ensue:
Abbot Lummingwyll: Attempts to deny
its existence or even eliminate those who
know of it. He may resort to releasing the
Wayward Afflicted (see Order of Battle).
Loyalists: Are torn and distraught,
though support Lummingwyll.
Cardinites: Foment an uprising, and/or
attempt to exit via the tunnel.
Proster: And some of the Cardinites see
this as the sign to release the Charge.

Order of Battle
Should they face an overwhelming
attack, the Wardens will free the 20 Wayward Afflicted in Area 47 and barricade
themselves in the vestorium (Area 50).

Pale, malnourished, pasty-faced human
men of varying ages. Clad in grey robes
belted with ropes.

Abbot Lummingwyll
(Loyalist Leader)

Reaction: When monks first meet PCs,
optionally roll on the Initial Reaction
table. If the encounter involves the secret passage from the surface (Area 50),
see Crisis of Faith, p38.
Knowledge: How to open the doors to
Areas 45, 51, and 52. Wardens who know
Lummingwyll’s role in the cataclysm do
not discuss it.

Low-light vision: Adapted to the darkness, lighting penalties are halved.

INITIAL REACTION
1

Attack PCs, believing them to be
disguised abominations from the
Rift.

2

Accept the PCs and escort them to
Area 43, where Lummingwyll is
summoned.

3

Ask if PCs have been sent by the
Church to help them, and attack if
told no.

4

Accept the PCs and immediately
attempt to involve them in the Order’s factional dispute (see Cardinites and Loyalists, p38).

5/6 Flee in confusion and terror, to
alert the others.

40

Lean, looming 6′ in height, with a
hawkish nose, slate-grey eyes, and a
fixing, powerful stare. Wears a stained,
threadbare mitre. Leader of the Order,
but respected primarily by the Loyalists.
Reaction: If the PCs have not triggered
a Crisis of Faith (p38), Lummingwyll
cordially welcomes them, eventually beseeching them to undertake a hopeless,
deadly task (see Lethal Quest).
Speech: Carefully inflected, lofty. Woldish, Liturgic.
Desires: To ruthlessly enforce eternal fealty to the Sollemitaine on all Wardens.
Would gladly imprison or kill any who
attempt escape.
Knowledge: Locations of all monsters
in eastern crypts. The hidden, safe exit
from the dungeon in the vestorium
(Area 50). The location of the key to the
Charge’s shackles (Area 51).
Lethal quest: Carry a “holy artefact” (a
useless engraved sceptre) into the Chaos
Rift (Area 32), entering as a group. Does
not mention the Rift’s lethality. Alleges
(falsely) that this will close the Rift and
save the abbey. Promises the Hand of St
Signis (see Area 49) as a reward.

upon his beliefs (see below) and enlist
them in his plan to free the Charge.

Desires: To maintain stability and make
life as bearable as possible. To continue
to fulfil the Sollemitaine.

imprisonment; he believes this will
liberate St Clewyd’s soul, end the cycle of
resurrection, and free the monks.

Knowledge: That Lummingwyll killed
Cardin (see Cardinites and Loyalists,
p38); he prefers not to think of it.

statues of St Clewyd (flank the falls,
solemn-faced, right palm upraised).
Drain at bottom (5′ wide grate,
channel exits the complex here).
Immersing a corpse: Driven by the
energies of the Chaos Rift, the pool has
the power to resurrect the dead. This
has sustained the Order of Wardens all
these years. There is a 5-in-6 chance of
a corpse reviving at dawn the following
day. Otherwise, it returns as undead:
Wayward Afflicted (see Area 46) if
previously resurrected 3 or fewer times,

its bony hands is the Gnomon.

The Gnomon
A long-lost holy relic: St Clewyd’s
personal prayer book, annotated in
his own hand.
Power: A holy spell-caster who grasps
the book while praying for spells is
treated as 1 Level higher than normal.
(e.g. a Level 2 cleric could memorise
spells as a Level 3 cleric.)
Value: 20,000gp.

The Charge
Shackled (bound in locked chains).
Bearded, elderly visage (yawning gap of mouth, great third eye).
Crowned with demonic heads (each
partially devouring the previous).
Horse legs (kick at the air at wild
angles). Snakes on chest (writhing).
Ring of flames (hovers above head).
Tiny, intangible demons (cavort
around feet, vanish and reform).
Reaction: Assesses whether the PCs
have come to free it. Tries to destroy
them if not.
Speech: A cacophonous chorus of triumphant and despondent voices. Woldish,
Liturgic.
Desires: Freedom, worship.
Releasing: Requires the key from
Area 51. The creature flees, attacking
any who interfere (see Epilogue, p52).
Slaying: The spirit of St Clewyd rises
from the body, implores PCs to “close the
Rift… cast it back in…”, then finally fades
into the afterlife.
Origin: The monster was formed from
the amalgamation of St Clewyd and Sallowbryg, but now acts and views itself as
an independent being.

Epilogue
THE CHARGE RELEASED

THE CHAOS RIFT CLOSED

If released, the Charge rapidly makes its
way to the central crypt (Area 30) and
the stairs to the surface, destroying all
obstacles in its path.

The closing of the Chaos Rift is a seismic
event, both within the abbey and beyond.

Should it reach the surface, it vanishes
into the woods. In time, it establishes a
lair, and roams Dolmenwood as a deranged prophet. It covets worshippers,
proselytising, enthralling, and forcefully
converting them.
Naming itself Mespular, it believes that
each of the Pluritine Church’s 33 other
major saints has a predestined demonic
counterpart with whom they must be
merged. Mespular preaches that once
this has happened, the dark dimension
from which it was born will merge with
the mortal world, ushering in a new age
of “peaceful, endless oblivion”.

All monks collapse into dust, their souls
finally freed—save a catatonic, defeated Lummingwyll. All monsters in the
crypts discorporate, except for the giant
telepathic catfish (Area 36). The abbey
is purged of all chaotic energies and
phenomena.
Once notified of the abbey’s purification,
the Pluritine Church moves quickly to
rebuild and reconsecrate it. The PCs are
rewarded by the Church, at the Referee’s
discretion.
The Inner Sanctum (Area 43) regains its
function as a shrine to St Clewyd. Characters praying there may receive the
blessing of St Clewyd: the ability to cast
Raise Dead. See Shrines, DCB.
The re-establishment of the Abbey of St
Clewyd is a major event in the history
of Dolmenwood. Its social, spiritual,
and political ramifications touch every
faction and plot line.

THE WARDENS FREED
Wardens who escape the complex
attempt to make their way to Prigwort
and contact Church authorities. Unless
the Rift is subsequently closed (see The
Chaos Rift Closed), they live out the
remainder of their normal lifespans.
If the Church believes their stories
(Referee's discretion), then within one
week, Sanctus Primus (DCB) personally
leads a force of the Order of St Faxis to
retake the abbey. The mission’s outcome
is up to the Referee, but a full victory is
possible only if the Rift is closed.

T

he once-proud Abbey of St Clewyd the Refulgent has
stood in ruins for a century, wracked with weird
energies and haunted by wicked spirits. Several
missions have sought to reclaim the abbey and quell the tides
of Chaos. All have failed. What treasures lie untouched within,
ripe for the picking? Can the mystery of the abbey's ruination
be unravelled and the forces of Chaos be vanquished?
The Ruined Abbey of St Clewyd is a weird crypt-crawl
adventure designed for characters of Level 4–6. Presented in
a quick-reference format, the adventure is easy to run with
minimal prep.

Introduction
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
Winter’s Daughter is a short adventure
set in Dolmenwood, revolving around
the forbidden love of a human knight
and a frost elf princess, in ancient times
when the two Kindreds waged war. PCs
journey to the knight’s tomb, which has
lain sealed for centuries and conceals
many secrets and treasures.

REQUIRED BOOKS
The Referee requires the Dolmenwood
core books (Player’s Book, Campaign
Book, and Monster Book) to run this
adventure. The following acronyms are
used when referring to the core books:
DPB: The Dolmenwood Player’s Book.
DCB: The Dolmenwood Campaign Book.
DMB: The Dolmenwood Monster Book.

CHARACTER LEVELS 1–3
This adventure is designed for PCs of Level 1–3. It makes a great introduction to Dolmenwood for groups new to the setting. A total of approximately 18,000gp worth of
monetary treasure is present. Magic items are also listed with their gp value. Selling
magic items for their full value is generally very difficult, and they do not grant XP
(unless using the optional XP for magic items rule—see Awarding XP, DCB).

LOCATION
Locate this adventure in any hex outside of the Witching Ring, Chell (see The Ring
of Chell, DCB). The adventure’s events do not relate to any specific location within
the forest.
As an intro adventure: Choose which settlement PCs will start in and locate this
adventure in the vicinity. For example, in hex 0609 (near Lankshorn), hex 1011 (near
Dreg), or hex 1306 (near Prigwort). The Referee may either require PCs to travel to
the adventure site or may start play as they approach the tomb (in Area 1).
In a campaign: Players with an investigative bent may uncover forgotten lore
relating to the war between frost elves and mortals that ravaged Dolmenwood some
nine centuries ago. The Referee could use these hooks to connect this adventure into
a wider campaign arc revolving around the attempts of the banished frost elf lord—
the Cold Prince—to return to claim Dolmenwood as his own.

3

Referee’s Background
The Cold Prince

Forbidden Love Discovered

The fairy lord who ruled all Dolmenwood, before the arrival of mortals.
(See Cold Prince faction, DCB.)

Before long, the Cold Prince discovered
his daughter’s betrayal.

Eternal winter: Under his rule, the
forest lay under an eternal cloak of frost
and snow.
Frost elves: The people of the Cold
Prince, immortal fairies as fair as snow
and as cruel as ice.
The war: Nine centuries ago, mortals
waged war against the fey armies of
the Cold Prince vying for control of
Dolmenwood.

The Love of Mortal and Fairy
In the midst of the war, a human knight
and a frost elf princess met and fell in
love.
Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk: The seventeenth daughter of the Cold Prince.
Sir Chyde: A near-mythical hero who
fought in the war against the Cold Prince.
First meeting: They met in the depths of
Dolmenwood, in a clearing beside a circle
of stones known as the Whything Stones.
Trysts: For months, the pair trysted in
secret glades, knowing that their love
was forbidden.
The portrait: Sir Chyde commissioned a
portrait of his love, entitled “The Lady of
the Wood”.
The binding ring: The princess pledged
her heart to the knight, bestowing on
him a magical ring that had the power
to bind their souls together for eternity
(see Ring of Soul-Binding, p32).

4

The princess imprisoned: His spies
captured her and brought her before
him. He decreed that she be imprisoned
in a forlorn tower, there to stay until she
renounced her foolish love.
Secret communion: Unbeknown to her
father, the princess was able to secretly
speak with Sir Chyde, even from her
prison, via the power of the binding
ring. The two schemed her rescue.

The Cold Prince Defeated
The mortal armies were victorious, and
the Cold Prince was exiled into Frigia,
his dominion in Fairy (see History, DCB).
Ever-looming threat: The Cold Prince
has not troubled Dolmenwood since,
but the threat of his return to the mortal world ever dominates the fears of
common folk.

The Death of Sir Chyde

The Effects of the Ring

The knight was slain in a great battle of
mortals and frost elves on the hills of the
High Wold, not long after his love was
imprisoned.

The power of the Ring of Soul-Binding
was not thwarted by death.

Dying wish: Sir Chyde insisted on being
interred in a tomb in the glade beside
the Whything Stones.
Grave goods: He wished to be buried
with the portrait and ring, and to have
an annexe of his tomb dedicated to his
betrothed.
Chapel of St Sedge: A chapel dedicated to his patron saint, Sedge, was
also integrated into the tomb. (Sedge is
the patron saint of holy warriors and
knife-makers, see the holy spell Bless
Weapon, DPB.)
A holy site: As was the way in those
days, the tomb of the great hero was
maintained as a site of pilgrimage.
Attendant: A priest lived in the tomb,
beside the chapel.

Beyond death: Sir Chyde’s spirit was
called back from the beyond, to linger in
his tomb as a phantom.
Drawing together: The prison of the
princess, in Fairy, and the tomb of the
knight, in the mortal world, were slowly
drawn together, bringing the two worlds
almost close enough to touch.
Communion: Even in death, the knight
and the princess could speak via the
power of the ring. They dreamed of their
reunion and marriage.

The Sealing of the Tomb
Fey influence: An unsettling, fey influence began to creep into the tomb.
The priest’s dreams: The priest who
maintained the tomb experienced
disturbing dreams and visitations, and
recommended that it be abandoned.
Closure: Guardians and wards were
placed, and the tomb sealed.

Centuries Passed
The tomb: Has rested quietly.
The princess: Remains imprisoned,
forgotten by her father, waiting with
ageless patience to find a way to be
reunited with Sir Chyde.
The wedding: Undeterred by death
and nearly nine centuries, the princess
stubbornly insists on holding a perpetual
wedding feast, awaiting the arrival of Sir
Chyde. Some few brave friends and allies
have journeyed in secret to her isolated
tower to join the long-delayed festivities.
The Whything Stones: Are now
frequented by the Drune—the cult of
sorcerers who covet the standing stones
and ley lines of Dolmenwood.

Hooks
DREAMS OF THE LADY

INHERITANCE

A valiant or courageous PC is visited in a
recurring dream by a beautiful elf lady,
clad in white. In the dreams, the PC falls
in love with the Lady, and awakes with a
deep yearning to be with her.

An elderly, long-lost relative of a PC dies,
bequeathing some minor wealth to the
PC (whatever the Referee wishes).

After some weeks of experiencing this
dream, the PC has a second one: venturing into a burial mound, opening a coffer,
taking a ring from the finger of a skeleton, and bringing the ring to the Lady. At
the end of this dream, the Lady tells the
PC that the tomb is a real place, and that
a magical door to her realm is located
there, in the lower level. She (falsely)
promises her heart to the PC, if they can
retrieve this ring that was stolen from
her in ancient times and bring it to her.
She reveals the location of the tomb and
says that one who bears the ring can
enter the magical door in the lower level
that leads to her realm in Fairy.

What’s Really Happening
Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk has discovered a means of contacting the mortal
world via dream. Her professed love is a
trick: she merely wishes the besotted PC
to retrieve the ring of Sir Chyde for her
(and hence his spirit).

Among the papers and oddments the PC
receives is an old charter, accompanied
with a family tree proving the PC to be
a distant descendent of one Brigford the
Wise, brother of Sir Chyde. (The Referee
may decide how accurate this genealogical information is.)
The charter shows the location of the
tomb where Brigford is interred alongside
his brother, noting that the fabled sword
and ring of Sir Chyde are (legally speaking) the property of the inheriting PC.
The documents claim that the ring has
the power to open a doorway to Fairy.

TOMB ROBBERS
A magician (for example Mostlemyre
Drouge in Prigwort—DCB) hires the
PCs to journey to an old burial mound,
giving them a map of its location. Their
mission is to enter the tomb and retrieve
the ring from the hand of its skeletal
occupant: a bronze band set with a
moonstone, with fittings in the form
of woven branches. Upon returning
this ring to the wizard, the party is to
be rewarded with a sum of 5,000gp (or
whatever the Referee wishes).

The Complication
The ring to be retrieved carries a fairy
enchantment: the ghost of Sir Chyde is
bound to it and will haunt any who steal
it (see Epilogue, p30).

Players’ Background
COMMON FOLKLORE

The Death of Sir Chyde

Not all that transpired in the past remains common knowledge. The following
tale is known among the common folk of
Dolmenwood, and may be heard by PCs.

The knight was slain in a great battle of
mortals and frost elves on the hills of the
High Wold.

The Cold Prince
The fairy lord who ruled all Dolmenwood, before the arrival of mortals.
Eternal winter: Under his rule, the
forest lay under an eternal cloak of frost
and snow.
The war: Nine centuries ago, mortals
waged war against the fey armies of
the Cold Prince, vying for control of
Dolmenwood.

Dying wish: Sir Chyde insisted on being
interred in a tomb deep in the forest.
The fate of the Lady: She was never
seen again. Some say she died in the
depths of the forest, in the glade where
she and her love first met.

DEEPER INVESTIGATION

Sir Chyde

If PCs spend time and money to employ
sages, seek out obscure tomes, or consult
with oracles, they may be able to divulge
some of the true story of the knight and
the princess. Each of the following facts
requires a significant research effort.

In the midst of the war, the fabled hero
fell in love with a woman called the
Lady of the Wood.

The identity of the Lady of the Wood:
Sir Chyde’s betrothed was in fact a frost
elf princess. Theirs was a forbidden love.

The Lady of the Wood: A sorcerous
woman of mysterious origin.

The ring: The ring which Sir Chyde
wore was a magic item from Fairy. It
bound his soul to that of the Lady.

First meeting: They met in the depths of
Dolmenwood.
The betrothal: The two pledged their
hearts to one another, exchanging rings
of engagement.

The Cold Prince Defeated
The mortal armies were victorious,
and the Cold Prince was exiled into his
dominion in Fairy.
Ever-looming threat: Every year, in
winter, the magic that banishes the Cold
Prince weakens and frigid winds whisper of his desire to reclaim his kingdom
in the mortal world.

Grave goods: Sir Chyde was buried with
the following items of note: the sword
with which he slew the fairy giant Butter-for-Bones, his moonstone engagement ring, the portrait of the Lady that
he had commissioned.
The sealing of the tomb: Sir Chyde’s
tomb was a site of pilgrimage for many
years, until a series of hauntings caused
the Pluritine Church to place magical
wards and seal it off.

the air and attack.
Speech: When animated, the objects
speak in a shrill, sanctimonious tone,
scolding PCs for their misdeeds (including
entering the tomb). They are otherwise
mindless and cannot be reasoned with.

Dusty Floor
If disturbed: Movement in the room
reveals colours beneath the dust.
If cleared: A mosaic is revealed, along
with scratches on the floor.
The mosaic: Depicts Sir Chyde atop a
white charger, piercing the heart of a
frost elf. An inscription in Old Woldish
reads “Here lies noble Sir Chyde, slayer
of Frost, defender of the King”. Speakers
of modern Woldish recognise the name
and the words for “Frost” and “King”.
The scratches: Something heavy was
dragged from Area 7 (a long time ago).

Referee’s Note (Area 14)
The vaulted chamber that characters perceive before passing through
the ward is the bottom level of the
tomb as it exists in the mortal world.
The nature of reality has been
warped here by the action of the
Ring of Soul-Binding, over the many
centuries it has lain in the tomb.
Fairy is now more present here than
the mortal world.
The wards at the bottom of the stairs
were placed by the Pluritine Church
when the tomb was sealed, in order
to prevent further encroachment
from Fairy.

14 WARDED POOL
Stone blocks (walls and floor).
Vaulted ceiling (20′ high). Shimmering pool (fills the room). Statue
of an elf or human woman (centre
of pool, white marble, long, flowing
hair and robe, upon her brow a star).

Candle Ward
Ghostly candles (dozens, floating in
mid-air). At the base of the stairs
(from Areas 6 and 7). Warding the
way (it is not possible to pass the
bottom step without passing through
the candles).
Fairy PCs: Feel the presence of the
ageless realm pressing against the ward,
from beyond the candles.
Passing through the candle ward:
Characters feel a wave of awe and a
brief vision of angelic guardians. The
vaulted chamber dissolves and reforms
into an outdoor scene with a white tower upon an island in a frozen lake—PCs
appear in Area 15.
Returning: Characters who came from
the tomb can pass back through the
ward (see Area 15, Paths into the Forest), but it is impassable to others from
Fairy. Upon returning, 1d6 days have
passed in the mortal world.
Dispelling: The ward is immune to fairy
magic, but can be dispelled by others.
Treat as if cast by a Level 10 cleric.

and becomes a mound of inanimate
moss. Raise Dead is ineffectual upon

Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk, the ghost of Sir
Chyde immediately manifests. The knight
and the princess embrace, as if able to
feel each other’s touch, even though he
remains insubstantial. They both weep
tears of joy and centuries-long heartache.

If the Ring of Soul-Binding is brought
from Sir Chyde’s tomb into Fairy, the
two worlds quickly start to drift apart.
Within a day or two, the doorways
between Areas 14 and 15 cease to exist—
Area 14 becoming once more a vaulted
chamber with a pool.

A wedding ceremony takes place in
Area 18, whereby the guests shower the
couple with frosted rose petals and Sir
Chyde vows to share eternity with his
immortal beloved, even if in the form
of a ghost. A great feast ensues. The formerly subdued atmosphere is replaced
with one of great joy and mirth.

The reunion of the lovers does not undo
the magical ban that keeps Princess
Snowfall-at-Dusk imprisoned in the
tower. Deeper magic or the intervention
of the Cold Prince himself would be
required for this. Likewise, Sir Chyde remains a ghost tethered to the ring. Only
with powerful magic (e.g. a wish) could
he be fully returned to life.

Friendly PCs are invited as guests of
honour. Those who aided the couple
are gifted with rewards (see Possible
Rewards, p28).

Sir Chyde or the princess might find a
way to contact the PCs in the future,
asking for their aid in these matters.

THE RING STOLEN

A DOOR TO FRIGIA

If the Ring of Soul-Binding is removed
from the tomb but not given to Snowfallat-Dusk, the one who possesses it will be
haunted by nightly visitations from the
ghost of Sir Chyde.

If the Ring of Soul-Binding remains in the
mortal world, the doorways connecting
Sir Chyde’s tomb with Princess Snowfallat-Dusk’s prison in Fairy persist.

At first, the ghost will plead with the
thief to return the ring, promising the
generosity of his elf bride. If the thief is
stubborn in their refusal to cooperate,
the ghost becomes angry and violent.
Only by slaying the ghost, unbinding the
ring (see p32), or returning it to the
Princess can the haunting be ended.

The tower in which Princess Snowfallat-Dusk is imprisoned is located in
an obscure reach of Frigia—the fairy
kingdom of the Cold Prince (see Fairy
Nobles and Their Dominions, DCB).
This region of Frigia has been drawn
close to the mortal world, due to the
action of the Ring of Soul-Binding over
the centuries that it has lain in the tomb
of Sir Chyde. The wards placed when
the tomb was sealed prevent natives of
Frigia from passing between the two
worlds, but travel from Dolmenwood
into Frigia is perfectly possible.
PCs who discover this door into Fairy may
wish to use it for any number of schemes
beyond the scope of this adventure.
The Cold Prince is ever seeking for ways
to return to Dolmenwood, so such a door
in his own kingdom would be a priceless discovery. The wards preventing
access to the tomb from Fairy cannot be
dispelled by fairy magic, but if a mortal
could be persuaded to undo this magic...

Magic Items
AMULET OF RUVANAITH

POUCH OF LIMITLESS FUNGI

An amulet of fairy silver carved with the
head of a bowing longhorn knight. Such
amulets were granted by the Cold Prince
to his most loyal breggle servitors, in
ancient times. (Value: 5,000gp.)

An burlap belt pouch stuffed with
colourful mushrooms. (Value: 2,000gp.)

The amulet has the power to grant a mortal wearer one wish (see Wishes under
Magic Items, DCB). Once the wish has
been used, the amulet’s magic is spent.

RING OF SOUL-BINDING
A fairy magic item that intertwines the
souls of two beings. (Value: 10,000gp.)
The person who possesses the ring can
give it to another person, causing them
to be bound. (A Save Versus Spell is
allowed, if unwilling.)
The binding may only be undone if: the
ring is destroyed; Dispel Magic is cast on
the ring or either of the bound persons;
either of the bound persons renounces the
binding; the one who gave the ring dies.

Effects on the Bound Persons
The bound persons may communicate
verbally via the ring.
Upon nights of the full moon, the wearer
of the ring may call the other person to
them. For the space of one night, the two
are united in person.
If the wearer of the ring dies, their spirit
cannot rest and will haunt the ring as a
ghost. Such a ghost is only able to manifest
in the presence of the ring (within 10′).

No matter how many mushrooms are
taken from the pouch, it is always full.
The first time a character eats a mushroom each day, it has a random magical
effect (roll 1d12). Subsequent mushrooms that day make the character sick.
Unless noted, all effects are permanent.
(Magic of curse removal nullifies.)

SHROOM EFFECTS
1

Double in size for 1d6 Turns, destroying clothing. Double melee damage.

2

Shrink to 6″ tall for 1d6 Turns.

3

Skin turns permanently purple.

4

9

Warm, fuzzy feeling. Automatically
succeed next Saving Throw.

A Mythic Journey
W

elcome to the Second Edition of Mythic Game Master Emulator! This book has been a long time
coming, but I’m pleased to present at last a fresh new version of Mythic that reflects nearly two
decades of player experience.
Mythic Role Playing was first published in 2003, the result of years spent longing for and
experimenting with a solo role-playing method that felt satisfying to me. Having used it for my own
solo adventures, I felt Mythic deserved to exist as its own book and not just scattered pages in a folder.
My intent was to produce a single copy for my own private collection—surely no one else would be
interested in such an unusual endeavor as solo role-playing.
I was pleasantly surprised to find there were many others also wanting an effective solo play strategy.
Fast forward to today, and oracle-style solo role-playing is a standard and accepted part of the tabletop
role-playing industry with its own vibrant and creative community. Mythic has inspired many others to
create their own solo oracle systems, leaving players with a wide variety of options that suit a gamut of
tastes and play styles. Solo rules are even finding their way into published games as an expected element
of the rulesets.
I cannot express how proud I am that Mythic has changed the hobby that I love. Where I once
assumed no one would be interested in solo role-playing because it went against the grain of what roleplaying games were perceived to be—a social experience—I now see it flourishing and growing.
And just like I felt Mythic deserved the respect of being in an actual book back in 2003, today I feel
Mythic deserves the respect of being in an updated volume.
This Second Edition of Mythic Game Master Emulator is meant to give the system a fresher, cleaner
look. The text has been rewritten with an eye towards making Mythic approachable to new players while
still giving experienced players plenty to work with. The core mechanics are much the same, with some
streamlining based on almost 20 years’ worth of Mythic play and feedback from fans. New material has
been added, some unique to this edition, some adapted from Mythic Variations, Mythic Variations II, The
Adventure Crafter, and Mythic Magazine.
The rules and ideas contained in this book are what I believe to be the most essential tools for
successful and enjoyable solo role-playing today.
Happy adventuring!
Tana Pigeon, January 2023

Mythic Adventures
T

he Mythic Game Master Emulator replaces
a live Game Master (GM) with a set of rules
that emulate a GM’s creative decision-making,
allowing you to play any role-playing game (RPG)
solo or in a group without a designated person to
run things. Mythic becomes your GM, answering
your questions and progressing the adventure one
step at a time. While the system is based in your
expectations and interpretations, it’s designed
to periodically subvert those expectations and
introduce surprises to keep the narrative exciting.
This may sound complicated, but Mythic’s core

mechanics are deceptively simple, and once you
put them into practice it won’t be long before it all
starts to click.
Let’s go over the various ways that Mythic can
be used as well as the individual components that
make it all work.

MYTHIC, YOUR
ROLE-PLAYING
PARTNER

HOW DOES IT WORK?

There are a number of ways you can use the
Mythic Game Master Emulator. Here are a few to
get you started.

How does Mythic emulate and replace a living
human being who would otherwise be running
your game?

Solo Role-Play
Mythic is designed primarily for solo roleplaying, where you play alone with your RPG
system of choice and use Mythic to answer
questions, resolve the action, and guide the
narrative along.

Mythic uses a few concepts to achieve this end:
»

A Yes/No question and answer mechanic

»

Random Events that add surprises

»

Meaning Tables that offer inspirational
prompts for important details

»

Lists tracking important goals and characters
which are randomly selected when called for

»

A Scene structure to give your adventure
form and order

»

A Chaos Factor that changes the tempo of the
adventure as you play

Group Role-Play With No GM
The same rules that allow you to play solo
can also be used by a group of Players referring
to Mythic for answers instead of a GM. Group
play like this requires Players to agree on when
to ask questions, what questions to ask, and how
to interpret results. Exactly how you arrange
to play will depend on your particular group’s
dynamics; see the sidebar “Mythic With a
Group” on page 8 for some suggestions.

Everything above is guided by your expectations
and interpretations based on the ongoing
Context. This makes sure the adventure continues
in a coherent fashion while still allowing for twists
and subversions that keep things exciting.

7

MYTHIC ADVENTURES

Co-GM

MYTHIC WITH A GROUP

The tools that allow you to generate adventures
on the fly also allow a GM to run a traditional
role-playing group using Mythic behind the
scenes. This gives you the freedom to decide how
much you want to come up with yourself and how
much you want to discover in play.
You could start your adventure with no prep
and use Mythic to come up with everything as
you go, leaving you almost as surprised as your
players, or you could generate the adventure in
advance and tweak things to your liking before
you hit the table with your group. If you’d
rather split the difference, Mythic can be used
to come up with “adventure seeds” that act as
a springboard for your own ideas without you
having to start from scratch.
If you’d prefer to do most of the prep work
yourself, you could use Mythic to fill in the gaps
of your outline or shape anything you hadn’t
counted on once the adventure is live. Mythic can
easily become your advisor, suggesting twists or
alternatives to what you already have that you can
run with or discard as you see fit.

A group of players using Mythic to guide their
adventure should decide ahead of time how
decisions will be made, such as what the first
Scene will be, how to come up with Expected
Scenes, when to ask Questions, what Questions
to ask, and how to interpret Mythic’s answers
and prompts. Here are a few suggestions on
how to divvy up this work:
DECIDE AS A GROUP: Have everyone collaborate
and make decisions together. This can be efficient
if you all work well together; however, it can
also slow things down as you pause to reach a
consensus at every decision point.
CHOOSE A PRIMARY GUIDE: Pick one person
to have the final say after hearing everyone
else’s suggestions. This has the benefits of
group improvisation and moves faster than
deciding everything as a group.
ROTATING GUIDE: Choose a Primary Guide,
then periodically change who that Guide is,
such as every Scene or every dice roll. This is
probably the best balance of group input and
game efficiency. Everyone gets their chance
to be in control, and no one Player bears
the full burden of decision-making because
responsibility is shared evenly around the table.

... And Another Thing ...

The methods above all require Players to
cooperate and trust each other. Each of you
needs to accept that your ideas won’t always
prevail, and that’s okay. You’re a group of
storytellers working together in a tradition
going back thousands of years. There’s also the
satisfaction of knowing that none of you are
fully in control: Mythic is part of the group as
well, acting as the Game Master who ultimately
determines whether or not your ideas play out
as expected.

Above are the most common ways Mythic can
be used. However, imaginative players can find
other ways to use Mythic as well.
For example, Mythic can be used as a writing
tool to help you craft fictional stories. Since
Mythic is, at its heart, a narrative constructor, it’s
only natural that it’d make as good an assistant
writer as it does an assistant GM.
If you love being a Game Master, you can flip
the script and use Mythic to emulate live Players
instead, asking Fate Questions to see what the
Player Characters do as you run them through an
adventure or published module.
Speaking of published modules, Mythic can
also be used to run yourself through a published

adventure solo; you can find guidance for this on
page 156.
The possibilities are endless!

MYTHIC ADVENTURES

FATE QUESTIONS

WHAT YOU NEED

Fate Questions are the core of Mythic, the
mechanism through which the adventure moves
forward. The idea behind Fate Questions is that
you can ask Mythic anything, posed as a Yes/No
Question, just as if you were asking a live Game
Master. Is the room occupied? Does the alien
attack? Do I find any ammunition after searching
the house? Is the treasure chest locked? Does the
wizard cast a spell?
When you ask a Fate Question, you decide on
the Odds that the answer will be Yes based on
your impression of the adventure so far, or the
Context. Mythic uses common language for Odds
to make them as intuitive as possible, such as
Likely, 50/50, or Nearly Certain.
Once you have your Question and your Odds,
you consult the Fate Chart to get the percentage
chance of a Yes answer, then you roll 1d100. If you
roll that percentage or less then the answer is Yes;
if you roll above it then the answer is No. Rolling
very low or very high will give you Exceptional Yes
or Exceptional No, respectively. Once you have
your answer you interpret it in the Context of the
current adventure and keep playing.
With each Question having four possible
answers the narrative of your adventure will shift
slightly with every Question you ask, and the
answers you receive and how you interpret them
will shape the Context. This process of Question,
answer, interpretation builds on itself: every new
Question adds Context and sends the adventure
in a direction, leading to the next Question
which does the same, and so on. In this way Fate
Questions construct your adventure as you play.
The further along you get the more naturally the
process flows.
Fate Questions are discussed in the “Fate
Questions” chapter on page 17.

You don’t need much more than this book to get
a Mythic adventure off the ground.
Mythic Fate Questions and tables require the use
of two d10 dice. These are usually rolled to get
percentile results (1-100). You’ll also need a d4,
d6, and d8 for rolling on Lists.
Any sheets and forms you may need are included
with this rulebook. You can also find downloads
for them on the wordmillgames.com website.

CHAOS FACTOR
A good GM knows when to ramp up the
tension and when to ease off and let the players
catch their breath. This ebb and flow of action is a
crucial part of any adventure and it rarely stays the
same throughout.
The Chaos Factor is Mythic’s way of simulating
this changing tempo. It uses a value between 1
and 9 to measure how much control the PC has
over the action. The higher the value the more
Mythic generates active elements such as Random
Events, unexpected Scenes, and Yes answers to
Fate Questions.
The Chaos Factor is discussed in the “Fate
Questions” chapter on page 17.

MYTHIC ADVENTURES

WHAT’S CHANGED?
You may be familiar with the first edition of Mythic Game Master
Emulator and wondering, “What has changed?” While the rules
have been completely rewritten most of the core components
of Mythic are the same while much has been added or refined.
Here is a summary of the biggest changes:
THE FATE CHART: Odds have been slightly simplified and some
of their titles changed to hopefully give a more intuitive feel for
deciding Odds as you play. The table itself has been redesigned
to also make it more intuitive, and some of the percentages have
been lowered to add more uncertainty to Fate Question answers.
THE FATE CHECK: This mechanic was brought in from Mythic
Variations II. It has been refined to make it feel more like the
Fate Chart.
RANDOM EVENT FOCUS TABLE: The Focus Table has a new
addition to it, “Current Context”. The d100 roll values have also
been slightly re-balanced.
CHOICES: Mythic GME Second Edition gives more power to Player
choices. You’ll find rules pertaining to choices throughout the
book. For instance, choosing an Event Focus instead of rolling is
an option.
LISTS: There is more direction in how to handle Lists in a
defined way. Lists are also weighted, with elements able to
appear more than once on a List. This makes Threads and
Characters Lists more dynamic.
MEANING TABLES: Some of the words in the Actions and
Descriptions Meaning Tables have been changed to make their
meaning more clear.
ELEMENTS MEANING TABLES: In addition to the Actions and
Descriptions Meaning Tables there are 45 Elements Meaning
Tables that are more specifically themed. This gives you the
option to choose a Meaning Table that is most relevant to the
current Context.
OPTIONS: There are a lot of options throughout Second Edition,
more ways for you to customize your Mythic experience. These
run a wide gamut, from choosing how you want to start and end
Scenes to mechanics like Keyed Scenes to guide your adventure.
DISCOVERING MEANING: Referred to as “Complex Questions”
in Mythic Variations, Discovering Meaning is about generating
adventure details by rolling on a Meaning Table. This takes on
greater significance in Second Edition with the wider range of
Meaning Tables.

10

MYTHIC ADVENTURES

MYTHIC ADVENTURE ELEMENTS

RANDOM EVENTS
Although most of your adventure is built upon
Fate Questions, Mythic will periodically interject
new elements at random. These Random Events
allow Mythic to add surprises and plot twists that
aren’t based in your expectations, guaranteeing
that you’ll never know for sure what’s going to
happen next.
Random Events can occur when you ask a
Fate Question or when you start a new Scene.
They are generated using the Event Focus Table
and the Meaning Tables. The Event Focus tells
you which aspect of the adventure the Random
Event involves, while the Meaning Tables
give you a pair of words meant to inspire an
interpretation of what the Random Event is. If
the Event Focus Table gives you “PC (Player
Character) Positive”, and the Meaning Tables
give you the words “attainment” and “travel”,
you might interpret these words to mean that
your post-apocalyptic PC has found a working
vehicle, or that your high-fantasy PC has found
a possible means of escaping the dungeon they’re
trapped in.
Random Events are discussed in the “Random
Events” chapter on page 35.

SCENES
To keep your unfolding adventure within a
structured narrative Mythic divides the action
into Scenes. What constitutes a Scene is up to
you, but just like in a movie a Scene should
be a discrete portion of your adventure that
encapsulates an important moment or event. A
Warrior searching through a cave system and
battling lizardmen or a space-traveler walking
through a market and buying supplies for his ship
can both be a Scene.
When the important action in that Scene is over
the Scene ends and we move on to the next Scene.

11

MYTHIC ADVENTURES

The end of a Scene is when Bookkeeping takes
place: updating the Threads and Characters Lists
and adjusting the Chaos Factor.
Scenes are discussed in the “Scenes” chapter on
page 59.

USING THIS BOOK
The core rules for using Mythic Game Master
Emulator to run solo role-playing adventures
are spelled out in three main chapters: Fate
Questions, Random Events, and Scenes. These
chapters tell you everything you need to know to
run exciting and effective Mythic adventures.

LISTS

If you want to add more to your Mythic
experience check out the Variations chapter.
This section has additional rule supplements,
variations on the core mechanics that might
better suit your play style, and discussions on
how to use the Mythic system in different ways.

Mythic uses a simple List system to keep
track of important goals and characters in your
adventure. The Threads List is for adventure
objectives while the Characters List is for
important Non-Player Characters (NPCs). These
Lists are adjusted at the end of each Scene with
Threads and Characters being added or removed.
(You can also add Threads and Characters as they
appear if you’d prefer.) Lists come into play with
Random Events which use the Lists as random
tables that you roll on to select which Thread or
Character the Random Event is referring to.
Lists are discussed in the “Scenes” chapter on
pages 60 and 111.

If, on the other hand, you’re unfamiliar with
solo role-playing or unsure of how the rules in
this book are used in play, The Big Example
offers a detailed demonstration of Mythic in
action that will hopefully shed some light on the
system’s ins and outs.
You’ll find a quick reference guide to the core
rules in the Rules Summary chapter. This is
handy for when you need a brief refresher on
Mythic’s mechanics.
The final portion of this book is a collection
of all the tables and charts found throughout,
gathered in one place for easy reference during
play. These pages have had the top and bottom
borders removed for cleaner printing so that
you can make copies for your own personal use.

MEANING
Meaning Tables serve a purpose beyond
Random Events: they can also be used to add detail
to your adventure without asking a Fate Question.
Asking a Yes/No Question assumes that
you have some expectation for the outcome.
You might ask the Question “Is there a
mushroom person in the cavern?” because you’ve
encountered mushroom people in your adventure
before and have come to expect seeing them.
However, there will be Questions for which
you have no expectations, and times when you
want detail that doesn’t fit easily into a Yes/No
framework. Questions about what something
looks like or what someone does can fall into
this category. In cases like these, you can get the
information you need through Meaning Tables

or through one or more Fate Questions. Both
options can achieve the same narrative end, and
the one you use in a given situation may simply
depend on your preferences.
The Player Character (PC) encounters a new
Non-Player Character (NPC) in an alternate
dimension, and the Player has no idea who or
what the Character could be. They could ask
a Fate Question like, “Is this person hostile?”,
or they could go to the Meaning Tables to get
inspirational words for what the NPC looks
like and how they initially act. Maybe they roll

“ruin” and “mundane” and interpret this to
mean that when the NPC is encountered he is
vandalizing a building.

COMING TO TERMS WITH TERMS

You can consult the Meaning Tables at any
time to get a pair of words to use for inspiration
and learn more about your adventure world.
Meaning is discussed in the “Random Events”
chapter on page 46 and in the “Scenes” chapter
on page 84.

This book uses a lot of phrases and terms you may
or may not be familiar with. Here are the most
frequently used terms and their abbreviations:
Chaos Factor (CF): A value between 1 and 9
used to control how much activity Mythic throws
at you during an adventure.
Characters: Important people (and sometimes
non-people) who populate your adventure. Player
Characters (PCs) are characters controlled by you,
the Player(s). Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are
the characters your PCs interact with during an
adventure which are mostly controlled by Mythic.

EXPECTATIONS &
INTERPRETATIONS

d100: Shorthand for a pair of ten-sided dice
rolled together. You’ll see other dice types
mentioned as well, such as d4, d6, d8, d10, and
2d10 (rolling two ten-sided dice and adding them
together instead of treating them as a “tens” die
and a “ones” die like you do for d100).

The rules above are all tied together by two
things that come from you: expectations and
interpretations. The mechanics for generating
adventures on the fly while still forming a
cohesive narrative hinge on you following your
expectations, testing those expectations with
Questions as you see fit, and interpreting the
results of those tests. Your interpretations then
become narrative fact, which feeds into your everevolving expectations of what happens next.

Fate Questions: Mythic’s central mechanic for
generating information about your adventure as
you play.
Game Master (GM): The person in charge of
running an RPG. When playing solo, you and
Mythic share the role of GM.

Expectations

Lists: When capitalized, this refers to the Threads
List and Characters List of a Mythic adventure.

Most Mythic play is done improvisationally:
you decide in the moment what your PC does
and how they respond to a given situation. You
also improvise any details and circumstances in
the adventure world that you don’t feel the need
to test. This is you following your expectations
about the adventure.

Random Events: These are unexpected
occurrences in your adventure that Mythic uses
a special procedure to create.
Role-Playing Game (RPG): An organized system
of rules for playing out engaging, immersive
stories. While Mythic can be played on its own,
it’s most commonly paired with a separate RPG,
which the rules refer to as your “chosen RPG”.

For example, let’s say a sci-fi PC is walking
through a crowded market on a space station.
His Player doesn’t feel the need to randomly
generate the details of the market, so they decide
that the market is what they expect.

Scenes: Basic units of in-game time. When you see
the rules refer to Scenes with a capital S, they’re
referring to a Mythic Scene in your adventure.
Threads: Tracked goals your PC is pursuing in
an adventure.

Your expectations are used in Mythic to
determine what is happening in the adventure
much of the time. Just like with the space station

13

MYTHIC ADVENTURES

Player decided that their expectations did not
need to be tested.
While your expectations will often be
sufficient, you may choose to test them at any
time. Usually you’ll do this when you aren’t sure
exactly what to expect or when you have multiple
possible expectations.

SOLO PLAY EXAMPLES
This book assumes you’re familiar with table-top
role-playing; however, even seasoned role-players
may not be familiar with playing solo. If you’re new
to this style of play, one way to get accustomed
is to see others doing it. I’ve peppered this book
with italicized examples that illustrate various
Mythic concepts, and one of the later chapters is
an extended example that demonstrates how all
of these concepts work together.

Our sci-fi PC wants to hire more crew for his
ship, so he goes to a bar because he’s had success
in picking up crewmembers in such places before.
After buying a drink, he asks the bartender if she
knows of anyone looking for work. The Player
thinks the bartender would know, but they aren’t
sure. It’s time to test this expectation and see
what the bartender says.

There are also many talented solo roleplayers online who make videos and podcasts
documenting their adventures. Not only are
these episodes fantastically entertaining, they
also serve as excellent examples of how to solo
role-play. Each host runs their games in their
own ways, which gives you the opportunity to
see a variety of play styles. You can find these
shows through a Google search or by asking
around online role-playing communities; I’ve
compiled a list of some in the “Resources”
section of wordmillgames.com.

Testing an expectation in Mythic is done
through Fate Questions. You pose your
expectation as a Yes/No Question, assign it Odds
based on your confidence in getting a Yes answer,
and roll on the Fate Chart.
If you get a Yes, then events unfold as you
expected; if you get a No, then something else
happens instead.
The Player poses their expectation as a Fate
Question by asking, “Does the bartender direct
me to a possible hire?” with the chosen Odds of
Very Likely. A Yes would mean the bartender
does know of a hire and directs the character
to them; a No would mean she doesn’t know of
anyone looking for work.

example, we often have expectations about
what’s going on and what will happen next: how
something looks, how a creature acts, what’s
inside a treasure chest, whether the damaged
vehicle will operate, and so on. These expectations
will change throughout the adventure based on
the events that unfold.
Everything that happens in your adventure
which you establish as narrative fact is Context,
and Context is what you base your expectations
on. As the Context grows through play, your
expectations become more developed.
You follow your expectations when you are
sure of them. In the example above, the Player
felt they understood what the space station was
like because they had come across other space
stations earlier in the adventure. There was plenty
of Context to build these expectations on, so the

Interpretation
Once you’ve tested your expectations with a
Fate Question you then interpret the answer you
receive. Mythic provides a general framework
of four possible answers to your Questions: Yes,
No, Exceptional Yes, and Exceptional No. Just as
your expectations guide you through developing
detail in your adventure, they also form the basis
of your interpretations.

14

MYTHIC ADVENTURES

An Exceptional Yes might be interpreted this
way: The bartender taps the bar top, and a
monitor inside it lights up. “Check the board—
it’s full of people looking for work. Dozens,
maybe hundreds. You should have no problem.”

TUNING YOUR IMAGINATION
Playing an RPG by yourself can take some getting
used to, particularly if you’re accustomed to the
traditional dynamic between yourself, your GM,
and your fellow gamers. There is a dynamic to
solo role-playing as well, but it’s one you have to
discover on your own because it will be unique to
your style of play and what you enjoy most about
the gaming experience.

An interpretation of a No answer could be this:
The bartender shakes her head. “Sorry, you’re
not the only captain looking for crew. I don’t
know of anyone looking for work right now.”
An Exceptional No might be interpreted this
way: The bartender gives him a serious look.
“This station is corporation owned; it’s illegal
for independents to try and hire crew here. I’ ll
pretend I didn’t hear you.”

My suggestion is to try one or two “practice”
adventures with Mythic to get a feel for how it
works. Don’t try to force anything; let yourself
experiment and make mistakes. You’ll probably
hit a few sticking points, but as you work past
them, you’ll develop a sense of how everything
works. Once you get past those initial hurdles,
solo role-playing becomes much easier and much
more exciting, and you’ll find your adventures
flowing smoothly as you find your groove.

All of the interpretations above were
informed by the Context of previous encounters:
crewmembers often hang out in bars on stations;
there are other ship captains on this station;
corporations are a force in this adventure; their
influence is stronger in some places than others.

While a solo role-playing experience loses the
social aspects of RPGs, it gains whole new
aspects that aren’t possible with group play.
You can explore any theme or adventure in any
way you wish, make your adventures as big or
as small as you like, as epic or as personal. Solo
role-playing really is an experience like no other.

Putting It All Together
When you interpret an answer Mythic gives
you, that interpretation becomes narrative fact
and part of the Context for future Questions and
expectations. Mythic adventures proceed in this
fashion from one interesting moment to the next,
building your adventure detail by detail.

You may find that playing solo makes you a
better player or Game Master in a traditional
group setting. The solo experience gets you
to think about characters and adventures
in ways you may not have before, and these
perspectives and experiences can easily carry
over into social role-playing.

YOUR CHOSEN RPG
Mythic is meant to fill the role of Game
Master for your role-playing adventures. It can be
used with just about any RPG out there, allowing
you to play the game while Mythic answers your
questions just like a Game Master would.

An interpretation of a Yes answer from the
bartender could be this: The bartender smiles
and nods. “Oh yeah, there’s a few hungry people
around here looking for work. See that guy in the
corner booth? Go talk to him.”

Fate Questions
A

FATE QUESTIONS

sking and answering questions is the heart
of a Mythic adventure, your principal tool
for learning about the game world and
moving the narrative forward.
Mythic handles this process of inquiry using
Fate Questions: ask a Yes/No Question, determine
the Odds of the answer being Yes, consult the
Fate Chart to get the percentile chance, and roll
1d100. Your roll will determine whether the
answer is Yes, No, Exceptional Yes, or Exceptional
No. Interpret the result within the Context of
your adventure and continue playing.
All of your Questions about the adventure can
be resolved in this manner. “Are there monsters
in this room?” “Is the door locked?” “Is it raining
today?” Anything you would ask your Game
Master in a social role-playing game you can ask
Mythic in a solo game.

WHEN TO ASK A
FATE QUESTION
As you play through an adventure, you improvise
the details based on what you expect your Character
to experience. You can pause your improvisation
at any time to test an expectation with a Fate
Question; usually, you do this during a moment of
narrative tension or when you’re unsure of what will
happen next.
The Player Character is on a distant planetary
colony, trapped in a building overrun by
aggressive alien creatures. They find themself
in the building’s control room, where they plan
to activate the blast shields on all the windows
and doors in the structure. Everything seems to

17

FATE QUESTIONS

be functioning fine, so The Player expects the
blast doors to respond, but they aren’t sure. What
if the aliens damaged something? The Player
decides to ask the Fate Question, “Do the blast
shields go up?”

ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS
Mythic relies on Fate Questions to construct
the narrative of the adventure as you play; what
you ask and how you ask it will influence your
game. While it’s best to phrase Fate Questions as
naturally as possible, there are a few guidelines
you should keep in mind.

Later in that same adventure, the PC is searching
for weapons and has made their way to the
colony’s armory. The Player doesn’t know if there
are any weapons left. Maybe the original colonists
cleaned out the armory when they first faced the
alien invasion. Since the Player is unsure, they
ask Mythic, “Are there weapons here?”

Action Oriented
The Chaos Factor assumes that Yes answers are
typically more active than No answers, so you’ll get
the best results if your Fate Questions focus on
active and interesting elements. “Are there zombies
outside?” is better than “Is it all clear outside?”

THE FATE CHART
The Fate Chart on the following page is used
to determine the percentile chances of your Fate
Questions receiving a Yes answer. Along the left
side are probability descriptors (Impossible, Likely,
Nearly Certain, etc.), and along the bottom is the
Chaos Factor.
When asking a Fate Question, decide what you
think the Odds are of the answer being Yes. This
is a gut decision based on the Question you’re
asking and the Context you’re asking it in. The
Fate Chart’s Odds uses common language such as
Likely or Impossible to judge probability.

Guided By Expectations
It’s generally best to let your Questions be guided
by your expectations rather than your desires. A
party of adventurers prowling down a dungeon
hall might easily ask, “Do we hear anything?”
but it would make little sense to ask, “Do I look
down and see a Vorpal Blade of Instant Murder
at my feet?” The current Context offers no logical
expectation to prompt the second Question, but
it does for the first.

Let’s say the Player Character is an occult
investigator searching a library for tomes of
magic. The Player decides to make this search
into a Fate Question: “Does he find any tomes?”

Context is different from the previous one:
there’s less evidence that books of magic would be
present. Given this Context the Player assigns the
Odds of 50/50.

Maybe at this point in the adventure the PC
has come across strange magic and supernatural
events, and he knows that the library he’s
searching through once belonged to a sorcerer and
occultist. Given this Context the Player assigns
this Question the Odds of Likely.

Choosing Odds
Who determines the Odds of a Fate Question?
Well, if you’re playing solo, then you do. If
you’re playing with a GM, then they do. If you’re
playing with a group then the Players must all
reach a consensus on how the Odds are chosen.

On the other hand, maybe the original owner of
the library is unknown but the Player suspects
they might have been involved in magic. This

Your choices start in the middle at 50/50.
These are the Odds to choose if you think there’s
roughly a 50% chance of getting a Yes answer, or
if you have no idea of the probability. Odds range
upward from 50/50 to Likely, Very Likely, Nearly
Certain, and Certain, and downward from 50/50
to Unlikely, Very Unlikely, Nearly Impossible,
and Impossible.
You may wonder at the Certain and Impossible
Odds. After all, if something is impossible or
certain then it’s a foregone conclusion, right?
Not necessarily. The Odds are based on what
you think they should be at the current moment,
and that opinion is based on the Context of the
adventure. Allowing some wiggle room in the
results of extreme Odds acknowledges that what
you and your PC know about the adventure is
not absolute. Something may seem certain or

5

impossible, but unfolding events can still prove us
wrong about what we thought we knew.
Extreme Odds can also become more or
less likely based on the Chaos Factor. When
the narrative is in high gear the impossible can
become probable for the sake of keeping tension
and excitement high.

The Chaos Factor
The Chaos Factor is a value tracked throughout
the adventure that represents how much control
the Player Characters have over current events.
The more out of control Scenes get, the higher
the Chaos Factor will climb; the higher the Chaos
Factor, the greater your chance of getting a Yes
response to Fate Questions. The Chaos Factor

FATE QUESTIONS

CHAOS FACTOR VALUES

SHIFTING TONE
A live Game Master isn’t going to maintain
the same tone throughout an adventure; there are
times they’ll want to push more action and times
they’ll want to dial it back. The Chaos Factor
shifts throughout your adventure to simulate a
GM shifting the tempo while running a game.
Since Yes answers to Fate Questions tend to be
more action oriented, they become more and more
likely the higher the Chaos Factor climbs. Higher
Chaos also means higher chances of Random
Events and a greater likelihood that your Scenes
will start in unexpected ways; these aspects of the
Chaos Factor are discussed more in the “Random
Events” and “Scenes” chapters, respectively.
Here’s an example of how the Chaos Factor
influences Fate Questions to regulate the
atmosphere of a game:
The Player Character Safrid, a high fantasy
druid, has been exploring a dungeon. Safrid has
handled the dungeon’s various perils well so far,
and the Chaos Factor has fallen to 4.
Suddenly, he comes across a Bog Beast, a truly
terrifying creature! The battle doesn’t go well,
and he retreats, fleeing from the monster to
relative safety. This Scene was a mess for Safrid;
the PC definitely wasn’t in control. The Chaos
Factor goes up to 5.
In the following Scene, as Safrid flees, he runs
afoul of a trap in the dungeon and barely escapes
it with his life. Once again, this is a Scene where
Safrid had difficulty dealing with trouble. The
Chaos Factor goes up again to 6.

Things have been fairly calm in the last few
Scenes, with the Character maintaining control
for the most part, so the Chaos Factor currently
sits at a value of 3. Comparing the Odds of
Likely to the current Chaos Factor, the Player
determines that there is a 35% chance of finding
a tome of magic sitting on one of the shelves.

The higher Chaos Factor means Safrid faces
greater chances of active elements during the
adventure. Is there a trap in this room? Yes. Is
the door locked at the end of the hall? Yes. Is
the Bog Beast still chasing him? Yes. Chaotic
conditions in each Scene encourage more chaotic
conditions in following Scenes, creating a

22

FATE QUESTIONS

Using The Fate Chart

QUESTIONABLE CHAOS

You have your Question, you have your Odds,
you know the Chaos Factor; now it’s time to consult
the Fate Chart. Cross reference the determined
Odds with the current Chaos Factor to get the
probability of a Yes answer to your Fate Question.
You’ll notice that the values in the Fate Chart
are expressed with a large central number flanked
by smaller numbers on both sides. The central
number is the percentile chance of a Yes answer.
Roll 1D100 and compare the result to this value.
If you roll within the value, then the answer is
Yes; if you roll above it, then the answer is No.
By rolling very low or very high you can
achieve Exceptional results. The smaller numbers
to the left and right of the central number
represent the extreme 20% of the Yes and No
ranges, giving you a 1 in 5 chance of a Yes or No
answer being Exceptional. Rolling equal to or
less than the left-hand number is an Exceptional
Yes; rolling equal to or higher than the right-hand
number is an Exceptional No. A value of “X”
means an Exceptional result is not possible with
those Odds.

The Chaos Factor is a major influence on the
answers to Fate Questions. While this is meant
to vary the tone throughout the adventure, you
can adjust the Chaos Factor’s influence to suit
your tastes. Check out “Choose Your Chaos
Flavor” in the “Variations” chapter on page 147
for variant rules that change how much power
the Chaos Factor exerts.

snowball effect where the tension slowly increases
and the Chaos Factor continues to rise.
Eventually, Safrid gets a handle on things
again. He finds a place to rest; he prepares for
the Bog Beast and defeats it; he finds a potion
that heals some of his wounds. The Character
is facing the challenges of the adventure headon and overcoming them. This control over the
adventure reverses the rising tension, and things
calm down as the Chaos Factor falls to 4, 3, and
even 2.
The lower Chaos Factor starts to have the opposite
effect from before: now that things are calm in
the adventure, and the Chaos Factor is low, No
answers to Fate Questions are more common.

TO ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION

When the Character is in control, No answers
tend to be negative for them. Is there treasure in
the chest? No. Does he have any food left? No.
Now the lower Chaos Factor is working against
Safrid; this encourages the pendulum to start
swinging back the other way, setting the stage for
future challenges that the character may face.

Mythic will yield one of four responses to
a Fate Question: Yes, No, Exceptional Yes, or
Exceptional No. This gives you four possible
paths of interpretation.

Yes

Not every Scene or Fate Question follows
these assumptions exactly, but when you look at
the course of an adventure as a whole they tend
to hold true. The overall result is that the Chaos
Factor shifts the tone of the adventure so you
never get too comfortable or too sure of exactly
how things are going to unfold.

A Yes response to a Fate Question means the
answer is your Expectation of what a Yes would
mean. This is the most straightforward of the
possible answers and likely won’t require much
interpretation.

A No response to a Fate Question means
the answer is the next most Expected outcome
from what a Yes would have meant. With simple
Questions, a No may be the opposite of a Yes and
therefore easy to interpret; a complex Question
might require more interpretative legwork.

The answer is No. Go

expected outcome.

“Is the door locked?” No, it’s unlocked. “Does the
black hole begin to suck us in?” No, you’re fine
for now. “Is the gladiator armed with a sword?”
No, he’s armed with a spear.

The answer is the opposite
of a Yes, or the opposite
of a Yes intensified.

Exceptional Yes
An Exceptional Yes is the same as a Yes but
intensified, meaning you take your Yes answer to
the next logical level.
“Is the door locked?” Yes, and it’s a darn good
lock. “Does the black hole begin to suck us in?”
Yes, and the stressors are causing damage all
across the ship. “Is the gladiator armed with a
sword?” Yes, a huge greatsword.

Exceptional No

Values on the Fate Chart are expressed with a central, large number
showing the percentage chance of a Yes answer. Rolling 1d100 equal
to or less than this number is a Yes answer. Rolling equal to or less
than the number on the left, the lower 20% of the Yes answer range,
is an Exceptional Yes. Rolling above the central number is a No, and
rolling equal to or above the rightmost number is an Exceptional No.
In the cutout above, a roll of 1-10 would be an Exceptional Yes, 11-50
a Yes, 51-90 a No, and 91-100 an Exceptional No.

An Exceptional No is the opposite of a Yes
answer. If that would be the same as a regular No,
then it’s the opposite of a Yes intensified.
“Is the door locked?” No, in fact the door is
partially open. “Does the black hole suck us in?”
No, you’re actually moving away from it. “Is
the gladiator armed with a sword?” No, he’s not
armed at all.

FATE QUESTIONS

Random Events

THE ART OF INTERPRETATION

One consequence of asking Fate Questions is
inviting a Random Event to occur. When rolling
d100 to answer your Question, if you get a double
number (11, 22, 33, etc.), and the single value of
that number (1, 2, 3, etc.) is equal to or less than
the current Chaos Factor, then you’ve triggered a
Random Event. We’ll delve more into Random
Events in the next chapter.

Interpretation is an important part of the
emulating process. Mythic answers your
Questions, but these answers are merely
prompts for you to make sense of.
Often interpretations will come easily. If the
Question was, “I open the desk drawer; is there
a gun inside?” then a Yes or a No will be clear.
Sometimes, though, interpretations elude you,
or an answer won’t give you enough to interpret.
If you feel like you need more information you
can try to clarify the answer with another Fate
Question. “Is the gun a pistol?” “Is it loaded?”

THE FATE CHECK
Not everyone likes looking up percentile
values on a table. If you’d rather not use the Fate
Chart to answer Fate Questions you can skip the
Chart and use a Fate Check instead. You still roll
2d10, but this time you add the dice together
instead of treating them like a percentile. This
method of answering Fate Questions can be
faster than using the Fate Chart and it matches
the Odds fairly closely aside from a higher chance
of Exceptional results.

Be careful not to fall into the trap of asking for
more detail than you need. A string of narrow,
specific Questions can easily stall the flow of the
game. Unless it’s something important to the
adventure it’s generally best to ask a few “big
picture” Questions and run with your expectations
as far as you can. The goal is to gather just enough
information to move things forward.

Fate Check Answers

Adjust For Odds & Chaos Factor

The “Fate Check Answers” table summarizes
what your roll total means. A modified total of 11
or more is a Yes answer, while a total below 11 is a
No answer.
As with the Fate Chart, rolling very high or
very low will give you an Exceptional answer. If
the modified total falls within the 18-20 range
then the answer is an Exceptional Yes; if the
total falls within the 2-4 range then the answer
is an Exceptional No. Your final total must fall
somewhere within those ranges to count as an
Exceptional result. A modified roll of 18 is an
Exceptional Yes, while a modified roll of 22 is
a regular Yes. This means modifiers will push
your dice total toward those ranges but may also
cause the total to exceed them, in which case no
Exceptional result occurs.

Like the d100 Fate Chart, a 2d10 Fate Check is
modified based on the current Chaos Factor and
the Odds assigned to a Fate Question. The “Fate
Check Modifiers” table on the next page breaks
down how the Odds and Chaos Factor affect your
roll results.
For instance, if you asked a Fate Question
with Odds of Very Likely you would apply a +2
modifier to the roll. If the Chaos Factor currently
stood at 4, you would apply another modifier of
-1. Adding both modifiers together gives a final
modifier of +1.
If your next Fate Question had Odds of Nearly
Impossible you would get a modifier of -4.
Combined with the Chaos Factor modifier of -1
your total modifier is -5.

Random Events

The Player assigns this Question the Odds of
Nearly Impossible (-4 modifier), and the Chaos
Factor is currently 6 (+1 modifier), resulting in
a final modifier of -3. This means the Player has
to roll at least a 14 to receive a Yes answer.

Random Events are handled the same way with
a Fate Check as they are with the Fate Chart. If
both dice come up as the same number (11, 22,
33, etc.), and the single digit value (1, 2, 3, etc.) is
equal to or less than the Chaos Factor, then you
get a Random Event. As with the Fate Chart, the
result that triggers an Event is still used to answer
your Fate Question as well.

The Player rolls 2d10 and gets a 3 and a 3. The
rolled total is 6 with a -3 modifier for a final
result of 3. That’s below the target number of
11, so the answer is a No. This result also falls
within the 2-4 range, making it an Exceptional
No. And since a double number was rolled (3
and 3), and 3 is within the CF value of 6, this
Question also results in a Random Event.

Safrid the Druid has survived the Dungeon of
Galzarad … so far. Now, in his travels through
a deep, subterranean cavern, he’s come across
a rope bridge suspended over a chasm. Using a
Fate Check, his Player asks the Fate Question,
“Does the bridge look stable?”

It looks like Safrid may be in for an interesting
time trying to get across that bridge.

FATE QUESTIONS

WHEN TO RUN WITH
EXPECTATIONS
AND WHEN TO
QUESTION THEM

SAMPLE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
“We crash land the plane in an open field as safely as
possible. Did it sustain any damage?”
Yes: The plane is damaged but not in any way
that can’t be repaired.

Fate Questions should be asked when you aren’t
sure whether an expectation you have is true. The
more you use Mythic to create adventures the more
you’ll get a feel for when to ask a Fate Question and
when to stick with your expectations.
If you find yourself conflicted, follow your
interests, consider the Context of the adventure,
and listen to your gut. Does it feel right to pose this
detail as a Fate Question, or are you certain enough
to take it for granted?
As your adventure progresses and develops more
Context Fate Questions and their answers will get
easier and easier to come up with. Much of the
narrative’s richness will come from details that were
fleshed out by prior Fate Questions. Establishing
that a certain NPC is unfriendly will shape your
later expectations about that Character and
might impact the Odds of future Fate Questions
concerning their actions. In this way, a logical
chain of events will build upon itself, shaping the
structure of the adventure and spinning it into a
narrative just like a Game Master would.

No: The ground was smooth enough that you
were able to roll it to a stop in one piece.

Give Me More!

No: All is peaceful.

Exceptional Yes: The ground was rough. One
of the wheels came off in a ditch and pitched us
sideways, crumpling a wing as we slammed into
the ground. The plane is an unflyable wreck.
Exceptional No: A perfect touchdown without
any damage. In fact, the plane is well-positioned
for takeoff once you find fuel.
“We succeed in breaking open the vault. Do we find
the vaccine inside?”
Yes: Yes, you do.
No: The vaccine isn’t there.
Exceptional Yes: You find several cases of the
vaccine, many more than you expected.
Exceptional No: You find the broken, ruined
vials of the vaccine—it’s been destroyed.
“We make our way through the woods. Do we
encounter anything today?”
Yes: Yes, now you have to figure out what the
encounter is.

Exceptional Yes: More than one encounter.
Figure out what the first one is, then once that’s
resolved figure out the second one.

In order to keep things moving in your
adventure a good rule of thumb is to try and limit
yourself to no more than two Fate Questions
for any one detail; that should give you enough
information to reach a reasonable expectation for
just about anything. If you can manage with only
one Question so much the better.

Exceptional No: All is peaceful today and tonight
as well, so there’s no need to check again when
you make camp.

A pair of occult investigators are creeping through
a graveyard at midnight, searching for the walking
dead. They come across a mausoleum and inspect
the entrance to see if it’s been opened recently.

One of the Players asks, “Do we hear anything?”
Mythic says Yes, but the Player doesn’t have a
clear expectation of what is heard.

27

FATE QUESTIONS

“Does it sound like something scrambling inside
a tomb?” No. “Does it sound like someone
walking through the graveyard?” No. “Does it
sound like something flying through the air?” No.

USING MYTHIC AS AN RPG
So far, this section has focused on using Fate
Questions to replace “spot rules” in your chosen
RPG, thereby reducing the time you spend
flipping pages in search of a mechanic you can’t
remember. You can take this further by replacing
any rules you don’t feel like using, or you can even
forgo the rules entirely and just use Mythic. This
spectrum from Mythic to mechanics lets you be
flexible with how you play.

The Player is muscling through a run of
No answers in search of a Yes, but they could
have stopped after the second Question (“Does
it sound like something scrambling inside a
tomb?”). They already know that the investigators
hear a noise that isn’t coming from inside the
mausoleum, so a logical expectation at this point
might be that they hear something outside in the
graveyard—perhaps a shuffling sound—or that
they hear something too faint to identify and will
have to investigate further.
After two Questions the Player has enough
information to make a reasonable interpretation
that matches their expectations.

For instance, if you wanted to use a chosen
RPG but felt more inspired by its setting than
its actual rules, you could just take the setting
and replace the mechanics with Fate Questions.
But maybe there are some rules in the game
you really like, such as a sanity system or a
cybernetic hacking minigame. These you could
port over as Fate Questions, following the tone
and intent of the original rules but resolving
them with Mythic instead.

USING FATE
QUESTIONS TO
REPLACE RPG RULES

You can also use this approach to learn a new
RPG. Rather than reading it cover to cover, you
can just start playing and replace anything
you don’t understand yet with Fate Questions.
Then, as you learn more of the RPG, you can
incorporate more and more of the game rules
into your adventure.

You can ask any Fate Question during an
adventure, even one that would normally be
handled with the mechanics of your chosen RPG.
If you can’t recall a certain rule or haven’t fully
learned the game, you can use Fate Questions
as an on-the-spot substitute, similar to the “snap
judgements” a live GM might make to save time.
You can assign Odds to these Fate Questions
based on the Context of the adventure and your
current understanding of the RPG’s rules.

This is another beautiful thing about solo roleplaying: you have tremendous control over how
you play, not just in the narrative of the adventure
itself but in the meta aspect of what rules you use
and how you use them.

and they don’t want to stop in the middle of
playing to look them up.

The Player is playing a post-apocalyptic game
that has rules for randomly determining details
about any surviving settlements the Player
Character comes across. During an adventure,
the PC encounters a village, but the Player can’t
remember the rules for generating settlements

They do remember that the process involves
determining key factors like population size,
technology level, and systems of law and order,
so they take this knowledge of the RPG rules and
turn it into Fate Questions: “Does the village
have a decent size population?” “Do they have
advanced technology?” “Is the village ordered and

structured?” Once the Player has enough to go on
the PC can begin to interact with the new location.
Later on in the adventure the PC ends up in a
situation where she is at risk of drowning. The
Player can’t remember the rules for determining
whether a character drowns, so to keep things
moving they leave it up to a Fate Question: “Does
the PC start to drown”? They then interpret the
resulting answer and continue playing.

Mythic’s Fate Questions are intended to
guide the narrative of an adventure and the
Chaos Factor is there to regulate that narrative.
Questions like “Does the kingdom have harsh
laws?” are narrative, story-oriented Questions; the
answers to them can vary depending on the CF,
and the CF varies depending on what’s happened
in the adventure so far. Past narrative impacts
current narrative.

29

FATE QUESTIONS

But when you’re using Fate Questions to
replace the rules of an RPG (combat “to hit”
rules, recovery from damage, task resolution,
etc.), what matters more than the ebb and flow
of narrative tension is consistency. I suggest, in
these cases, that you disregard the current CF and
treat it as a value of 5. This will give those Fate
Questions default, middle of the road percentiles
without the Chaos Factor skewing results.
You should also consider whether to honor
Exceptional results. Unless you know that the
rule you’re replacing has degrees of success and
failure, it may be best to treat Exceptional results
as regular answers.

FATE QUESTIONS AS RPG RULES

The Player has just picked up a new superheroes
role-playing game. They understand enough of
the rules to make a Character, so they decide to
jump right in with a solo Mythic adventure.
During the first Scene, the PC finds themself
in an apparently empty building. They have
a power that allows them to sense when other
people are nearby, but the Player can’t remember
the rules for how to use it. Looking it up would
break the narrative tension, so the Player decides
to pose it as a Fate Question instead: “Do I
successfully use my power to sense if there are
others nearby?”

FATE
QUESTION

Pose the Fate Question
to act as the RPG rule.

CHAOS
FACTOR

Treat the Chaos Factor
as a value of 5 for these
Questions, regardless of
what the actual Chaos
Factor value is right now.

EXCEPTIONAL
RESULTS

Treat Exceptional Yes and
No as a regular Yes and No
if the rule being replaced
doesn’t use degrees of
success or failure.

RANDOM
EVENTS

Ignore Random Events
unless they make sense
to include with this rule.

The power worked; the PC is psychically
scanning the building for the presence of others.
So, do they detect anyone?
Asking a Fate Question to use the power was
done to replace a rule in the RPG. Now that we
know the power succeeded asking if we detect
anyone is a normal, narrative Fate Question.
The Player goes back to using regular Mythic
rules: they ask a Fate Question, “Do I detect
anyone?”, assign it Odds, and allow the Chaos
Factor of 7 to influence the result.

The Player knows that the PC’s power should be
strong enough to cover the entire building (unless
the building is actually bigger than it looks), so
they decide that the Odds of a Yes are Nearly
Certain. Since this Fate Question is replacing a
rule in their chosen RPG, they ignore the current
Chaos Factor of 7 and treat it as a 5. According
to the Fate Chart, this gives the PC an 85%
chance of successfully using their power.

Another thing you may want to consider
is ignoring Random Events that result from
Fate Questions used as RPG rules. As with
Exceptional results this may depend on whether
the rule from your chosen RPG has a similar
mechanic that allows for additional consequences.
Ignoring Random Events in these cases are a
judgement call on your part; sometimes it may
make sense to generate the Random Event, and
sometimes it may not.

The Player rolls and gets an 8. With the modifier
from the Odds, this puts the result within the
range of an Exceptional Yes. However, the Player
knows that this RPG doesn’t have degrees of success
for this power—it either works or it doesn’t—so
they treat the answer like a simple Yes.

FATE QUESTIONS

THE BIG FATE
QUESTION EXAMPLE:
Henny In Z Land

exit there would likely be stuff left along the way
that could be useful to others.
The Player next generates the Random Event
(using the rules in the next chapter, which we’ll get
to soon) and interprets the results as Henny and
Malcolm coming across a seemingly abandoned
encampment. This Random Event works well with
the Yes answer to the Fate Question.
The Player interprets all of this as Henny and
Malcolm discovering an abandoned encampment
in the woods. There are remnants of a fire, a
backpack that’s seen better days, and a torn tent.
The discovery of the camp was interpreted
from the Random Event. For the Question about
finding anything useful, the Player interprets the
Yes answer as the Characters finding a few cans
of food while digging through the abandoned
campsite. Considering they haven’t eaten in over
24 hours finding food is certainly useful.

Let’s put the rules of this chapter into action
with a trip into zombie territory.
In this example, the Player Character is Henny
Lassiter, a barista turned zombie apocalypse
survivor. Henny’s Player is using their favorite
end-of-the-world RPG with Mythic acting as the
Game Master of their solo adventure campaign.
Henny has already been through a few
adventures: surviving the initial outbreak, escaping
the city, and learning to get by in the wild. In
the current adventure, Henny and her rescued
companion Malcolm have made their way into a
forest in search of shelter, staying alert for zombies.
The Player asks, “Do I see any movement in
the trees ahead?” The current Chaos Factor is
4, and considering how deep in the forest the
Characters are, they figure the Odds of seeing
movement right now are Very Unlikely. This gives
them a 15% chance of a Yes on the Fate Chart.
They roll d100 and get 50, a No. The Player
interprets this to mean that the coast is clear, and
the two Characters continue on.
After what the Player decides is an hour’s worth
of walking, they ask, “Do we find anything useful
along the way?” The forest is on the outskirts of a
city, and Henny and Malcolm have been walking
for some time, so the Player figures the Odds of
coming across something now are Likely. They
check these Odds against the CF of 4 and get a
50% chance on the Fate Chart.
Rolling again, the Player gets 33 for a Yes, with
a possible Random Event since they rolled double
digits (a 3 and a 3). The 3 is equal to or less than
the CF value of 4, so a Random Event does occur.
The Player thinks about the Yes answer to the
Question first. What they would most expect to
find would be random supplies dropped by people
fleeing the city. In the pandemonium of the mass

When interpreting the Yes for the Question of
“Do we find anything useful along the way?”
the Player chose to follow their expectations
for what a Yes means.
If they weren’t sure, they could have tested
this expectation with another Fate Question,
such as “Do we find food?”
The Player decided to limit this to a single
Question and run with an interpretation
that made the most sense.
Henny and Malcolm continue their trek
through the forest. The day is wearing on; they’ll
need to find shelter before nightfall, when the
temperature will drop drastically.
The Player asks, “Do we find shelter in the
woods before night?” With hours of walking
between now and then the Player decides that
it’s Likely for them to find shelter of some kind
in that time. With the Chaos Factor at 4 the
percentile chance of a Yes is 50%.
The Player rolls and gets 9. Not only is that a
Yes it’s an Exceptional Yes since it falls within the

31

FATE QUESTIONS

lower 20% of the Yes range (for Odds of 50%, that
would be a roll of 10 or less). The Player interprets
this to mean that as the sun begins to dip towards
the horizon Henny and Malcolm spot a two-story
house, a full domicile, nestled deep among the
trees. This is a wonderful find! Not only will it
give them shelter for the night but there might be
all kinds of supplies and goods inside.
The two cautiously approach the house, wary
of any lurking zombies or fellow survivors looking
to protect what’s theirs. Henny takes a deep
breath and tries the door to see if it’s locked.
The Player asks, “Is the door locked?” but has
to think about the Context for a moment to try
and come up with Odds. Henny and Malcolm are
several weeks into a zombie apocalypse, and the
area has been mostly evacuated. However, this is a
nice house so anyone still around would probably
have sought shelter here just like Henny and
Malcolm are trying to.
The Player isn’t sure of the Odds to this
Question so they go with 50/50. With the Chaos
Factor at 4 the chance of a Yes is 35%. They roll a
92, an Exceptional No. The Player interprets this
to mean that not only is the door unlocked but
the house inside is in excellent shape. A valuable
find. Henny and Malcolm step inside.
Using Odds of 50/50 are good for when you
think the chances of something are about
even, but also when you have no idea what
the Odds for something should be.
Since the Exceptional result calls for
intensifying the answer the Player follows their
expectation for what that means in this situation.
Not only is the door to the house unlocked, the
interior is well stocked with food and goods and
even has running water and electricity. Whoever
lived here evacuated quickly, taking only essentials
and leaving everything else. It appears that Henny
and Malcolm are the first people to come across
the place since the outbreak began.

TYPES OF RANDOM EVENTS

ythic adventures may be guided by your
Questions and expectations to maintain
narrative congruence, but they’re also
filled with plenty of action that comes at us from
out of the blue. No matter how you think a
situation will unfold, Mythic can always step in to
take things in a new and unexpected direction.
These interjections are called Random Events.
They’re Mythic’s way of adding a dimension of
surprise to your adventure, resulting in plot twists
you might never have seen coming.
Random Events can occur at two points during
a Mythic adventure: when a Fate Question is
asked and when a Scene is first generated (see the
“Scenes” chapter for more information).

Random Events From
Fate Questions

Random Events From
Interrupted Scenes

Whenever you ask a Fate Question, there
is always the possibility of a Random Event
occurring. When rolling 1d100 for the Fate Chart
(or 2d10 for a Fate Check), if you get a double
number (11, 22, 33, etc.) whose digit (1 for 11,
2 for 22, etc.) is equal to or less than the Chaos
Factor, then a Random Event occurs. So if you
rolled a 55 while answering a Fate Question, and
the Chaos Factor was 8, then a Random Event
would take place, but if the Chaos Factor was 3,
then there would be no Random Event.

An Interrupted Scene is a twist that derails
your expectations about what will happen next to
create a new, surprise Scene.
Mythic adventures are broken into cinematic
Scenes that are generated from your expectations.
At the beginning of each Scene you decide how
you think that Scene will begin and then roll
to see if you are correct. Sometimes the Scene
will begin as expected; sometimes it will be
changed slightly; and sometimes a Random
Event will create an entirely new and unexpected
Scene called an Interrupt Scene. This process is
described more fully in the “Scenes” chapter.

35

RANDOM EVENTS

GENERATING RANDOM EVENTS

GENERATING
RANDOM EVENTS
Once a Random Event has been triggered you
need to figure out what happens. There are two
components to a Random Event: Event Focus and
Event Meaning. Both of these components are
interpreted through the lens of Context. Interpret
those elements together to get your final result.

CONTEXT
Context includes everything that’s happened
in the adventure up to this point. It is the
backdrop that should be taken into account when
interpreting any Random Event.
If the Player Character is a spy sneaking
through an enemy stronghold in search of stolen
plans for a military satellite, Random Events
should be interpreted with this setting in mind.
If an Event indicates that something negative
happens to the PC, then perhaps they are spotted
by a guard or drop their gun down a stairwell.
The Fate Question or tested Scene that
prompted the Event also counts as Context. If
your Fate Question was “Does the guard hear me
approach?”, and you generate a Random Event,
then the Event itself may have something to do
with the guard.
Keeping Context in mind will help you make
the logical leap toward resolving the Event in a
satisfying manner.

EVENT FOCUS

aspect of your adventure. For instance, the Event
might directly affect a Player Character, or it
might introduce a new Non-Player Character.
Here’s what all the table results mean:

When a Random Event is triggered you need to
establish where the action of the Event is focused.
This is done by rolling 1d100 on the Random
Event Focus Table. The result will point to an

36

RANDOM EVENTS

REMOTE EVENT

RANDOM EVENT FOCUS TABLE

A Remote Event means that something has
happened that your Character wasn’t present
for; they’re only learning about it now. This can
happen in many ways.
Maybe the Player Character encounters
the dead body of an NPC they met earlier in
the adventure, and the Remote Event is this
Character’s death, which the PC did not directly
witness. Or maybe the PC wanders into a tavern
and learns by word of mouth that the enemy
horde has advanced, destroying the next town
down the road.
Remote Events are a way of introducing new
twists into an adventure without the PC being
directly involved with them.

AMBIGUOUS EVENT
Most of the Event Focus Table results give you
a clear indication of what the Event is about. NPC
Action means that an NPC does something; PC
Positive means whatever that happens is good for
the Player Character. Maybe a Thread is being
closed, or maybe a new NPC enters the adventure.
Whatever it is, its impact on the adventure is clear.
An Ambiguous Event, however, is purposefully
vague. It’s something that happens which is
neither harmful nor helpful, at least not initially.
The PC in a zombie apocalypse adventure is
exploring an abandoned building in search
of useful items or food. Suddenly, they hear
something from the floor above: a bumping
and scraping, followed by rhythmic thumps
that might be footsteps. Is it a zombie? Another
survivor? Maybe it’s someone who can help them,
or maybe it’s just the wind blowing through an
open window. The PC doesn’t know.

This makes an Ambiguous Event an opportunity
to explore.
Or perhaps the Ambiguous Event is a new
element in your adventure that doesn’t make
sense now but might make sense later. If your
PC comes across a photo of several people while
exploring an empty house, is this photo a clue
related to what you’re searching for, or is it just a
random photo with no relevance to your mission?
Only time will tell.

An Ambiguous Event can be interpreted in
several different ways. Perhaps the Event is vague,
and you won’t know whether it’s good or bad
until you check it out, like in the example above.

37

RANDOM EVENTS

case they fit with future Context and help you
interpret later events.

EVENT FOCUS OVERLAP

The PC encounters a man in town he recognizes
from the photo he found in the house. After some
detective work, the PC discovers that the man
killed his own cousin, who is now haunting the
mansion. This turn of events—discovering the
murderer of the ghost—would not have been
possible without first having the Ambiguous
Event with the photo.

The results of the Event Focus Table are specific
about what aspect of the adventure the Random
Event is centered around: Player Characters,
NPCs, something bad, something good, and so
on. However, just because the table indicates
what element the Event includes doesn’t mean
it has to be the only element. There’s plenty of
overlap between results.
For instance, you might generate a PC Positive.
Yay! Something good just happened to your
Character, finally. Maybe the good thing that
happened is you gained an ally, someone who will
help you accomplish your goals.

NEW NPC
A new Non-Player Character enters the
adventure. This new Character plays a role in
the current Scene and will likely be added to the
Characters List when the Scene is over.

Well, hold on. Wouldn’t that be a Move Toward A
Thread or New NPC?

The PC in a sword-and-sorcery fantasy game
is exploring a dungeon. In a Scene where she’s
checking out a room, the Player gets a Random
Event with a New NPC, which they determine
to be a giant mutated rat. After a short battle,
the Player realizes that there are likely more of
these rats in the dungeon, so they add “Giant
mutant rats” to the Characters List.

Yes, it would be. You could have rolled any of
those for an Event Focus and come up with the
same interpretation. Whatever Event Focus you
roll is not meant to limit you; it’s simply meant
to be a starting place that helps you interpret
the final result. If that result includes multiple
elements from your adventure, then all the better.

In the examples above, the Ambiguous Events
don’t say anything about the narrative. A random
sound, a photo—these are details that may or
may not expand into something meaningful
later on in the adventure. They might turn out
to be significant, or they might turn out to be
red herrings or bits of ambiance. Interpreting an
Ambiguous Event doesn’t require you to figure
out what it means; you just have to leave yourself
open to the possibilities.
Ambiguous Events can easily turn into
narrative foreshadowing. Maybe those animal
sounds your PC heard in the woods are the
passage of small creatures they’ll soon encounter.
Maybe that photo you found will come in
handy later when you run afoul of a ghost in the
house. Keep those ambiguous details in mind in

NPC ACTION
An existing Non-Player Character does
something that impacts the adventure. Roll on
the Characters List to see which NPC acts for
this Event.
The PC, a zombie apocalypse survivor, is trying
to find antibiotics for a sick friend. She’s just
discovered a pharmacy, and searching through it
is the basis for this Scene.
As the PC cautiously enters the building, the
Player asks a Fate Question that generates a
Random Event with the Focus of NPC Action.
They roll on the Characters List and get “Dillard
Gang”, a violent group the PC encountered in an
earlier Scene that the Player subsequently added

38

RANDOM EVENTS

to the List. The Player determines that a member
of the gang is lurking in the store and ambushes
the PC as she approaches the pharmacy counter.

CHARACTER CRAFTING
If a Random Event calls for a New NPC but you
have no idea who or what it could be asking a
Fate Question or two can help you figure it out.
Alternatively, you can use an Element Meaning
Table.

NPC/PC NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE
Something bad or good happens to a Player
Character or Non-Player Character, depending on
which result you got on the Event Focus Table.
If the Event calls for a PC, determine which
PC it is. If you’re playing solo with a single Player
Character then this Event is automatically about
them; if there is more than one Player Character,
then choose the one you would most expect this
Event to apply to.
If the Event calls for a Non-Player Character,
roll on the Characters List to determine which
Character it is.
Negative and Positive outcomes of this
Random Event can run a gamut of possibilities
depending on the Context of the adventure
and how you interpret the result. The Positive
or Negative Event can be something storyshifting and important, or it can be something
minor, as long as you think it’s the most expected
interpretation of your results.

There are Element Meaning Tables for all kinds
of things pertaining to NPCs: what they look like,
how they act, their background, their motivation,
what they say, and more. You can pick and choose
which tables seem most pertinent in the moment
and use them to get to know the new Character
that was just
introduced into
your adventure.
You’ll find
more in-depth
discussion of
the Element
Meaning Tables
in the “Scenes”
chapter on page
84.

An occult investigator PC is trying to rid a
manor house of an angry, powerful ghost, but it
isn’t going well. During a Scene where the PC
is trying to banish the ghost with magic, Mythic
generates a Random Event with a Focus of PC
Negative. The Player is playing the game solo but
controlling two Player Characters—the primary
investigator Nigel and his assistant Clara—so
they have to choose which of them this Event
pertains to. They decide that Nigel is probably
the target of the Event since he’s the one casting
the spell.
The Player interprets this Event to mean that the
ghost exerts tremendous supernatural force and
pulls the entire house into a nightmare realm
where reality is shifting and uncertain.

39

RANDOM EVENTS

In a later Scene, Nigel and Clara are trying to
break down the door to the room where the angry
ghost originally died. They believe that this room
contains a family painting that’s serving as the
ghost’s anchor to the house, and that if they can
destroy it they’ll be returned to the normal world.

BUT, THEY’RE NOT HERE
Generating Random Events in Mythic is,
well, random. Any NPC you’ve placed on the
Characters List can turn up if the Event Focus
calls for it. But what do you do when the
Character called upon couldn’t possibly be there
for that Scene?

Mythic generates another Random Event during
this Scene, this time with a Focus of NPC
Positive. Rolling on the Characters List, the
Player gets Warren, the gardener and caretaker
of the mansion whom the PCs met in an earlier
Scene but haven’t seen for some time. Up until
now the Player assumed that Warren must
have met an unpleasant end somewhere on the
property. They interpret this Event to mean that
Warren comes running up the hall after hearing
Nigel and Clara’s attempt to break into the
room. The “positive” for Warren in this case is
that he’s still alive. Maybe he’ ll also be of help in
getting this door open …

When an NPC is invoked for a Random Event,
it doesn’t necessarily mean that the Character
themself is present and active, just that the Event
involves them in some way.
For instance, in the example on the previous
page, the survivor PC is searching a pharmacy
for antibiotics when the Player rolls a Random
Event with a Focus of NPC Action that invokes the
Dillard Gang. In that case it makes sense that a
member of the group would be physically present
in the store to cause problems for the PC.
But what if the Player got the same Event Focus
result later in the adventure when the PC
was flying in a small airplane? Here are a few
interpretations that would make sense:
»

MOVE TOWARD A THREAD
Threads are the goals and missions that the
Player Character is pursuing. This Random Event
brings the PC one step closer to resolving an open
Thread. Roll on the Threads List to see which
Thread the Event involves.

The pilot has been friendly and helpful up to
this point, even offering to fly the PC to a safe
place. But now she notices a tattoo on his
wrist, the same tattoo that the other Dillards
have. He’s one of them! The NPC Action in
this case is that he’s lying to the PC about
who he is and what he’s doing.

»

En route to the PCs destination, the pilot picks
up radio chatter from a settlement below.
They’re being attacked by the Dillard Gang!

»

While relaxing on the plane the PC checks
through her backpack to see what supplies
she has left. To her dismay, the Dillards must
have gotten their hands on it during her most
recent clash with them because all of her
ammo is gone.

The Player Character is a pulp era treasure
hunter exploring an ancient pyramid. During
this exploration, the Player runs into a Random
Event and gets Move Toward A Thread, with
the Thread being “Find the ancient tomb of
Ank-Tonen.”
The Player determines that the PC comes across a
wall inscribed with a crude map of the pyramid
complex, at the center of which is a symbol that
can only be the tomb itself. This is a major clue
for the PC: it shows her exactly how to get to
where she wants to go!

RANDOM EVENTS

MOVE AWAY FROM A THREAD

WHY THERE IS NO “NEW THREAD”

While the previous Random Event helps the
Player Character get closer to resolving an open
Thread, this Event does the opposite: it represents a
new hurdle or setback that hinders the PC’s progress
toward closing a Thread. Roll on the Threads List
to see which Thread the Event involves.

The Random Event Focus Table has three entries
pertaining to Threads, including Close A Thread, but
no New Thread. Characters have a New NPC entry,
so why don’t Threads have one as well?
There is no New Thread result because the Threads
you follow are decided by you, not the adventure.
Mythic will present you with opportunities and
ideas for goals to pursue, but it is your choice
whether to make any of them a priority.

The Player Character, a hired mercenary, is
tracking a criminal through the jungle when
a Random Event comes up with the Event
Focus of Move Away from a Thread, in this
case, “Capture the escaped criminal”. The
Player interprets this to mean that the trail has
disappeared and there is no sign of the criminal.
No tracks in the mud, no broken branches,
nothing. The PC must double back to find the
trail again, losing valuable time in their pursuit.

a large, locked chest. When he opens it Warren
pops out, gasping for breath. The ghost locked
him in the chest to get rid of him for good. With
that goal resolved, the Player removes “Find
Warren” from the Threads List.

The Event should make resolving the Thread
more difficult but not necessarily impossible; the
elimination of a Thread is handled with the next
result on the table or through normal role-play.

In another Scene, while consulting with a mage,
Nigel is informed that tampering with the spell
that summoned the ghost would only strengthen
its power. He had hoped it would help them
banish the ghost but now he knows there’s no
point in looking for it. The Player removes “Find
the spell” from the Threads List.

CLOSE A THREAD
This Random Event brings about the closure of
an open Thread. Roll on the Threads List to see
which Thread this involves.
Determining how the Thread is closed will
require interpretation, but whatever the Event is
it should either resolve the Thread or nullify it
somehow.

CURRENT CONTEXT
Whatever is happening in the Scene right now
becomes the Focus for this Event. If the Random
Event was generated from a Fate Question
then use the Context of the Fate Question as
the Focus. If the Random Event was triggered
as a Scene Interrupt then the Event is directly
related to whatever is currently going on in your
adventure. A Random Event with a Focus of
Current Context takes whatever is going on and
adds a new layer to it.

Nigel and Clara, the occult investigators, have
succeeded in returning the mansion back to the
normal world, but they still need to banish the
ghost, find Warren (who‘s disappeared again),
and find the spell that summoned the enraged
ghost in the first place.
While Nigel is rummaging in the cellar, Mythic
generates a Random Event with the Focus of
Close a Thread. The Player rolls “Find Warren”
on the Threads List and interprets this to mean
that Nigel hears knocking sounds coming from

The Player’s gunslinger PC bursts into a barn,
expecting to find the bandit he’s been pursuing.
The Player asks the Fate Question, “Is he in
here?” Mythic comes back with a No and a

Choosing The Event Focus

Random Event. The Event Focus Table comes
back with Current Context.

When a Random Event is generated you don’t
always have to roll on the Event Focus Table. If you
have a good idea of what the Event Focus should be
you can choose that result instead of rolling.
The PC, a space adventurer, is in a tight,
dramatic spot: caught in a phaser battle in the
engine room while the warp drive is spiraling toward
a meltdown. The Player asks a Fate Question
that generates a Random Event, but with so much
already going on having an Event introduce a brand

The Player thought this might be a big moment
in the adventure—capturing the bandit—but
they were wrong. This unexpected letdown is the
Context right now and this Random Event will
have something to do with that. Depending on
the Event Meaning generated, maybe the PC
finds a taunting message scrawled on the wall or
discovers a bedroll in the corner indicating the
bandit had been here but moved on.

RANDOM EVENTS

new and potentially unconnected element into
the Scene would be more cumbersome than
helpful. The Player decides to skip rolling for
the Event Focus and instead chooses Current
Context to ensure that this Random Event
will have something to do with the phaser
battle or the engine crisis.

WHEN TO CHOOSE
THE FOCUS

AMBIGUOUS
EVENT

The adventure has slowed and you
are ready for a mystery to pursue.

NEW NPC

There is a logical reason for
a new NPC to appear in your
adventure right now.

NPC ACTION

Your PC is waiting on the
action of NPCs to move the
adventure forward.

NPC NEGATIVE
or
NPC POSITIVE

You want to shift the focus of
your adventure onto an NPC
right now, maybe to develop new
storylines in your adventure.

There are circumstances in an adventure
where choosing the Event Focus may make
more sense than rolling for it. For instance,
in the example above the Player was
concerned a new wrinkle in the adventure
would disrupt the current Scene so they
chose Current Context to have a Random
Event that clicked with what was going on.
The Choosing The Event Focus Table
gives some situations where you might want
to choose a specific Event Focus.
How often you choose instead of roll
is your choice as well. If you want to have
more narrative control over your adventure
you may choose frequently or always. If
you want a game with more surprises you
may choose rarely or never.
If you want a middle ground approach
that allows some limited choice then give
yourself one choice every five Scenes. This
means you can choose any result on the
Event Focus Table for one Random Event
within any span of five Scenes. Once spent
you have to wait until the next span of five
Scenes begins before you get a choice again.
The Player above with the space adventurer
was in Scene 4 of their adventure. They
hadn’t chosen an Event Focus yet so the
option was available. After choosing the
Focus for that Event the Player won’t have
the option to choose again until Scene 6
through 10, then again at 11 through 15,
16 through 20, and so on.

RANDOM EVENTS

Empty List

LISTS AS
RANDOM TABLES

If you don’t have anything on your Threads or
Characters List—perhaps the adventure has only
just begun—then some results from the Event
Focus Table won’t be usable for you. When the
Event Focus Table calls for an element from an
empty List ignore the roll and treat the Current
Context as the Event Focus instead.

Lists are updated during the Bookkeeping phase
at the end of a Scene (discussed in the “Scenes”
chapter). This is when you decide which Characters
in the Scene were important enough to add to the
Characters List and if anything stands out as a goal
you may want to add to the Threads List.
The two Lists act as random tables used for
Random Events. Each List is broken up into 5
sections of 5 lines each. When you add to a List
you start at the top and make your way down
line by line. When you’ve filled one section of 5
elements and go on to the next that new section is
now activated and becomes part of the active List.
There are two columns of numbers on the
left of each List: rolling for the first column
determines which active section of the List to use,
and the second column determines which element
in that active section is chosen.
The first roll is determined by how many
sections of the List are active. If you have up to 5
elements on your List then you don’t roll for the
first column, you are only dealing with the first
section of the List (lines 1-5).

In an adventure set during a futuristic world
war, the PC is slowly moving through the snow
down a bombed-out street, staying behind cover
as much as possible while she searches for activity
in the area. The Player asks the Fate Question,
“Does she see anyone?”
Mythic comes back with Yes and a Random
Event. The Player rolls on the Event Focus Table
and gets NPC Negative, but this is the first Scene
of the adventure and the Characters List is empty.
Since this Event Focus isn’t possible, Current
Context becomes the Focus instead.

Get off the island
Find missing crew
Find mystical stone

Get off the island

Tocky McAdams
Bertha The Angry Avian
Jungle
Dinosaurs

If a Random Event calls for an NPC you don’t have to roll for the section
of the Characters List with this List, only the first section has any elements
in it. The player would just roll a 1d10 to determine which element is
invoked. A roll of 6, for example, would indicate “Jungle”.

Tocky McAdams
Bertha The Angry Avian
Jungle
Dinosaurs
Active volcano
Minga the lizard man
Unknown survivor

A few Scenes later the Characters List is more built up. When a Random
Event happens now that calls for an NPC the player must roll a d4 to
determine which section to use since there are now elements in the
second section on lines 6 and 7. A roll of 3 on the d4 and a roll of 1 on the
d10 would result in “Minga the lizard man” being selected.

RANDOM EVENTS

EVENT MEANING

WHAT’S THE NUMBER FOR?

You know the Context in which the Random
Event is taking place and you know what its
Focus will be. An interpretation may already be
forming, but it needs more. It needs a spark of
life. It needs Meaning.
Mythic uses Meaning Tables to generate a
pair of words that you use as inspiration to help
interpret a Random Event. Generating the Event
Meaning involves rolling 1d100 twice on an Event
Meaning Table to get two words. You pair these
words together and use their combined meaning
to suggest interpretations for your Event.

On the Adventure Lists there’s a number to the
right of each element slot listing the element
lines from 1 to 25. That’s there to give you a quick
reference for the current count of your Thread
and Character elements.
The numbers are also helpful if you’re using The
Adventure Crafter with Mythic and want to use
Mythic’s Adventure Lists. For more information
about combining The Adventure Crafter and
Mythic see page 171.

In our war example the Player knows the Focus
of the Random Event (Current Context), so they
roll on an Event Meaning Table and get the
words “Attach” and “Lies”.

If you have 6-10 elements you roll a d4, 11-15
elements is a d6, 16-20 elements is a d8, and 2125 elements is a d10.
When a Random Event requires you to roll on
a Threads or Characters List use the number of
active sections to determine which die to use then
roll to see which section this Event will use.
Once you know the section roll a 1d10 and
compare it to the second column of numbers
to determine which line in that section is being
invoked.
If you roll a line that has a Thread or Character
written on it then that Thread or Character is being
called upon by the Random Event. When you roll
a line that is empty of an element the result is
considered Choose. You have two options:
» CHOOSE AN ELEMENT: Select an
element recorded on the List that makes
the most sense in the current Context.
» CHOOSE TO ROLL AGAIN: If you
would rather be surprised then roll again
until you get an active element on the List.
The chances of rolling Choose will vary
throughout the adventure from zero chance (when
the active boxes in your List are full) to likely
(when an active box only has one element in it).
The more full your List gets the more rare Choose
will become.

After considering the Context of the adventure
and the Fate Question that generated the Event,
the Player makes this interpretation: as the PC
ducks behind a burnt-out car, she sees someone
tacking a sign to the wall of a building (Attach).
It’s a propaganda poster (Lies); this must be a
soldier from the Ministry of Information.

Meanings To Choose From
Event Meaning Tables come in three varieties:
Actions, Descriptions, and Elements.
The Actions and Descriptions Meaning
Tables each have a set of two d100 tables, while
the numerous Elements Meaning Tables each
have a single, specialized d100 table. You can
find the Actions and Descriptions Meaning
Tables, as well as the three most general Elements
Meaning Tables, on the next few pages. For more
specialized Elements Meaning Tables visit the
“Scenes” chapter on page 84.
Before rolling, choose the Meaning Table that
seems most appropriate for the current Event. You
really can’t go wrong with any of them—they all

RANDOM EVENTS

provide a starting point for interpretation—but
choosing a table that more closely matches the
Context of the Event gives you a better chance of
getting results that are easier to interpret.

DOUBLING DOWN
It’s possible to get the same result twice when
rolling on the Elements Meaning Tables. In this
case, consider that word “doubled down” and
interpret it with greater intensity than you would
have otherwise.

The Player’s sci-fi PC has successfully fixed the
ship’s engine, avoiding a devastating meltdown.
As they wrap up repairs and check on other
damage to the ship Mythic generates a Random
Event. The Player rolls a Focus of PC Negative,
indicating that something bad is about to happen
to the PC. That sounds active, so the Player rolls
on the Actions Meaning Tables.

For instance, let’s say your PC is searching
through an alien starship when they come to a
closed door. You ask a Fate Question: “Is the door
locked?” Mythic says No and triggers a Random
Event with a Focus of PC Positive.

Later in the adventure the PC leads a team
to the surface of a newly discovered planet.

You reason that the Event has something to do
with what’s beyond the door, so you use the
Location Element Meaning Table to get your
Meaning, rolling “Open” and “Extravagant”. You
might interpret this as finding a room full of
gizmos and fancy tech built into the walls with
windows looking out into space.
If you had instead rolled “Open” and “Open”, you
might describe the room as a platform jutting
out into open space, surrounded by a clear force
field—truly open in the most extreme way you
can think of.

ROLLING FOR MEANING

CHOOSING THE RIGHT MEANING

Both the Actions and the Descriptions
Meaning Tables are made up of two tables,
each with 100 results. To determine the Event
Meaning roll 1d100 on the first table and again
on the second table. This will give you a word
from each table to pair together.
The Elements Meaning Tables are each a single
d100 table; roll 1d100 twice on your chosen table
to get a word pair.
Whichever table you got them from, this pair
of words will help inspire your interpretation of
the Random Event.

With multiple Meaning Tables to choose from,
how do you know you’re selecting the right one
for your Random Event? It comes down to a
matter of taste: every table gives useful results,
but each of them gives slightly different results.

Actions Meaning Tables
The Actions Meaning Tables give word pairs
associated with active narrative elements. These
tables are best used to find out what someone or
something is doing or having done to them. For
instance, if a Random Event involved something
negative happening to an NPC then you could roll
on the Actions Meaning Tables to get an idea of
what occurred.

The Event Focus is New NPC and the Player
has chosen to use the Descriptions Meaning
Tables to get an idea of what this NPC looks
like. They roll “Calmly” and “Mundane”. The
Player might interpret this to mean that the
Character looks like every other traveler passing
through this space station, just calmly going
about their business.

Descriptions Meaning Tables
The Descriptions Meaning Tables give descriptive
word pairs that are useful for deciding what
something or someone looks like. For instance, if
the Random Event involved the introduction of a
new NPC you could use the Descriptions Meaning
Tables to determine their appearance.

If the Player had rolled “Roughly” and
“Bizarre” on the Descriptions Meaning Tables
they might have interpreted this to mean that
the NPC is a strange-looking alien, and a
rough-looking one at that. Maybe they’re a
bounty hunter with insect-like features wearing
battle scarred armor.

Elements Meaning Tables
The Elements Meaning Tables are themed,
giving more targeted results. The most general
Element Meaning Tables are Location, Character,
and Object; the Element Meaning Tables in the
“Scenes” chapter are even more specialized with
options such as Character Personality, Scavenging
Results, and Dungeon Traps.

INTERPRETING
THE EVENT

While they’re exploring Mythic triggers another
Random Event, this one with a New NPC
Focus. The Player considers which Meaning
Table to roll on. Maybe Action to indicate what
this new Character is doing? After thinking it
over they change their mind and decide to roll on
the Character Element Meaning Table, which is
more applicable to creating a new Character.

Mythic provides the foundation for your
Random Event: the Event Focus tells you what
aspect of the adventure to turn your attention
to, the Event Meaning suggests details, and the
Context of the adventure gives you a background
of previous events to draw from.
Now it’s up to you to determine how it all fits
together.

RANDOM EVENTS

The Lens Of Expectation

TRUST YOURSELF

Just as your expectations guide your
interpretation of Fate Questions, they also guide
your interpretation of Random Events. When you
combine the Context with the Event Focus and
Event Meaning, whatever your gut tells you this
all means is your expectations speaking to you.

Interpretation of Mythic prompts (Fate Question
answers, Meaning Table results, etc.) is more art
than science. You may encounter struggles such
as getting past the literal meaning of the prompts
or coming up with an idea you’re happy with.
My advice is to listen to your gut and trust
yourself. Open your mind, and don’t treat the
prompt like it defines your interpretation. Instead,
see the prompt for what it is: a starting point from
which you can take your interpretation anywhere
that’s fun and makes sense to you.

The Player Character is a wandering barbarian
in a medieval setting. Earlier in the adventure,
the PC undertook a quest to bring a fugitive to
justice. His search brought him to a forest village
and he’s decided to rest there for a while, doing
chores in exchange for room and board.
As he heads to the river to fetch water his Player
asks the Fate Question, “Is there anyone else at
the river?” The answer comes back No, but the
roll also generates a Random Event.

home so they can talk about something,
which turns out to be related to the fugitive.
All three interpretations are valid because they
all try to make sense of the Event Meaning
word pair, “Lure” and “Interior”. But which is
the best interpretation?

The Player rolls on the Event Focus Table and
gets a Focus of Move Toward A Thread. They
have one Thread on the List: “Capture the
fugitive”. Whatever this Random Event ends up
being the Player knows it’s going to help the PC
in his quest.

The first one, the PC finding tracks, could
be considered the most logical and expected
interpretation. The second one, finding a hut,
is possible but unlikely, certainly less likely than
finding tracks. The same is true for the third
interpretation, though it may be more expected
than finding the hut.

For the Event Meaning the Player decides it makes
the most sense to roll on the Actions Meaning
Tables because it seems like something active is
going to happen. They get “Lure” and “Interior”.
Given the Context, the Event Focus, and the Event
Meaning, a number of ideas spring to mind:
»

There is no wrong answer when it comes
to interpretations, but you should allow your
expectations to help you choose what makes the
most sense in the moment.

While fetching water the PC discovers
footprints in the muck that match the
fugitive’s. The tracks lead to a cave near
the river.

»

The PC spots a makeshift hut in the woods
beyond the river. Perhaps the fugitive used it
for shelter; he might even be inside it now!

»

While fetching water the PC is approached
by a villager who invites him inside her

You Need More Information
If the Event Meaning doesn’t give you enough
information to spark an interpretation, or if you
get stuck trying to come up with one, you can
always ask a Fate Question or two to narrow
down your options. For instance, the Player of the
medieval barbarian in the example above might

52

RANDOM EVENTS

ask the Fate Question, “Do I find the fugitive’s
footprints in the mud?”
Keep in mind that the Event Focus and Event
Meaning are inspirational prompts that don’t
have to be followed to the letter. As long as it fits
within a reasonable expectation, feel free to go
with any interpretation that makes sense, even if
it means stretching the Event Meaning a little.

RANDOM EVENT EXAMPLES
CONTEXT: The Player Character is a vampire
cruising a nightclub in search of your next meal.
EVENT FOCUS: NPC Positive; the NPC is a
random human.
EVENT MEANING: Triumph & Friend
INTERPRETATION: The human is sitting alone
in a secluded part of the club. The perfect
time to approach … but then his friends arrive;
apparently, he was waiting for them. Now he’s
in a group and much harder to feed on without
drawing attention.

While the PC is exploring the wreckage of a
starship on an alien planet, Mythic generates a
Random Event with a Focus of New NPC. To
find out what the new NPC is doing, the Player
rolls on the Actions Meaning Tables and gets
“Attack” and “Needs”.

CONTEXT: The PC is an old west gambler
stumbling through a graveyard at night when the
dead begin to rise.
EVENT FOCUS: NPC Action; the NPC is the town
sheriff.
EVENT MEANING: Abandon & People
INTERPRETATION: With all the PC’s whoopin’
and hollerin’ as the zombies claw out of the
ground, the sheriff comes running to see what’s
going on. He takes one look at the rising dead,
screams, and runs away.

A literal interpretation of this Meaning might
indicate that the NPC is attacking something
they need, but the Player could also abstract
the prompts and interpret the NPC as a
malfunctioning robot that’s attempting to break
into (“Attack”) a storage locker to replace its
dwindling energy cells (“Needs”).

MINING FOR MEANING

CONTEXT: You’re a smuggler piloting your ship
through space when you get stopped by an
Imperial cruiser that wants to board and search
you.
EVENT FOCUS: Move Toward A Thread; the
Thread is “Deliver the rebel commander to her
secret base”.
EVENT MEANING: Attain & Business
INTERPRETATION: While you scramble for
a lie to tell them over the comms, the rebel
commander hands you a code she says is a valid
shipping license. You send it to the Imperial patrol
and they let you go, seemingly satisfied.

Another way to figure out what a Random
Event means when you’re stuck for an
interpretation is to do another Meaning roll to
see what additional information an extra pair
of words suggests to you. You can use the same
Meaning Table you used for the Event or a
different one if it seems more appropriate.
The Player in the above example still isn’t sure
what to do with this Event Meaning, “Attack”
and “Needs”. It could be a robot banging away
on a storage locker, but that interpretation just
isn’t sitting right.

CONTEXT: You’re a magic-based superhero
investigating the crash site of a meteor.
EVENT FOCUS: PC Positive
EVENT MEANING: Trust & Possessions
INTERPRETATION: Your magic-detecting amulet
begins to glow, indicating that whatever was in
that meteor was mystical in nature.

The Player jumps to the Characters Elements
Meaning Table for more inspiration and rolls
the words “Fast” and “Official”. These seem to
reinforce the initial interpretation with a few
added details. The Player interprets this result to
mean that the NPC is indeed a robot breaking

THE BIG RANDOM
EVENT EXAMPLE:
Weird Times At
Wutwo Labs

THE “I DUNNO” RULE
Random Events add twists and turns to your
Mythic Adventure that aren’t the direct result of
Fate Questions. Sometimes, interpretation will
come quickly and easily; other times, it may be
more difficult.
If you find yourself well and truly stuck when
interpreting a Random Event, and clarifying Fate
Questions or additional Meaning words aren’t
helping, feel free to invoke the “I Dunno” Rule.

This example takes place in a contemporary
adventure using an RPG that’s all about sciencey
weirdness and strange tales. The Player Character
is Dyson McGrew, a security guard at Wutwo
Labs. Dyson never knew what the scientists
were making at the facility until the day their
experiments went haywire and brought on what
might be the end of life as we know it.
Dyson’s adventure begins ten stories
underground, where the errant experiment
exploded. The release of potent radiation and a
noxious gas cloud has led to mutations and the
warping of reality throughout Level 10 and above.
Dyson is fighting his way through the dangers
to get all the way up to the ground floor, Level
1, where he hopes to initiate Protocol WWZero,
an emergency failsafe that would lock down the
entire facility and keep the horrors contained
from an innocent and vulnerable world.
So far in the adventure, Dyson has had to
contend with spiders mutated to monstrous size,
random portals to a Doom Dimension that let
in the occasional interdimensional imp, fellow
workers of Wutwo Labs who will do anything
to survive and get the heck out of there, and
the endless search for security key cards needed
to access doors and make his way ever upward
toward sunlight and freedom.
In this Scene, Dyson has finally reached the
stairwell that leads to Level 9. He has his security
baton for a weapon and the battered door of a cola
vending machine for a shield. With him is Sandra
Copenhagen, a Wutwo scientist who is also trying
to get out. She’s letting Dyson use her security
clearance cards in exchange for his protection.

The I Dunno Rule is a way of saying that it’s okay to
let the Random Event drop and just move on with
your adventure. If no interpretations are coming
to mind, or the Random Event just isn’t making
sense, then forget about it and proceed as though
you never rolled it. Continue your adventure rather
than hold it up.
Be careful not to overdo the I Dunno Rule. There’s a
difference between taking forever to come up with
the perfect interpretation and taking a moment to
craft something workable. It’s easy to overthink the
results of Random Events; I suggest you go with the
first thing that comes to mind, just like you would
when interpreting Fate Questions.
But if you really are stuck on an interpretation then
let it go and move on for the sake of narrative flow.
Your adventure will thank you for it.

into a locker to get a new energy cell. Specifically
it’s a security robot (“Official”), likely part of
the downed ship’s original crew, and it’s making
short work of the locker with a laser built into its
arm (“Fast”).

overrun with mutated plants. Vines crisscross the
walls and ceiling, some of them writhing.
Later in the Scene Dyson and Sandra find
themselves trapped in a laboratory with a former
scientist who’s turned into some sort of moss
person. He seems to have lost his mind and Sandra
suggests that if he touches them they may become
infected with the same creeping moss condition.
No one wants to turn into creeping moss.
Dyson looks for a way out of this room, ideally
one that won’t require pushing past the shambling
moss-man. His Player asks the Fate Question, “Is
there a way out of here?” Mythic says Yes but also
gives them a Random Event.
Up to this point the Player hasn’t determined
what the moss-man is doing, just that he’s in the
room with them and appears to be contagious.
They decide to use Current Context as the Event
Focus instead of rolling on the Event Focus Table.

Dyson cautiously peers around the corner in
the corridor. The fluorescents are out, but the dim
red emergency lights have kicked on, and he can
see the stairwell door at the end of the hall.
Dyson’s Player asks the Fate Question, “Is there
anything in the hall?” Mythic says No but triggers
a Random Event.
The Context doesn’t suggest any particular
Event Focus, so the Player rolls on the Event
Focus Table and gets NPC Negative. Rolling on
the Characters List, they get “Giant spiders.”
It looks like something bad is going to happen
to a giant spider. That sounds like an action to the
Player, so they roll on the Actions Meaning Tables
and get “Betray” and “Weapon”.
The Player thinks about this a moment and
decides that “Betray” means the spiders are
fighting amongst themselves. Weapons could refer
to the spiders as well since they were part of a
secret weaponizing project.
The player runs with this interpretation: as
Dyson peers around the corner, he sees that the
hall is clear but there is motion in a room along
the hall. It’s a big conference room with a large
plate glass window facing the hall. Inside the
room are a group of giant spiders.
While Dyson watches one giant spider
approaches another spider and suddenly pounces
on it. They begin thrashing about in a violent
battle. Several more spiders join the fray and now
it’s an arachnid brawl!
“Let’s make a run for the door while they’re
distracted with each other!” Dyson says, perhaps
too brave for his own good.
With his shield raised, he and Dr.
Copenhagen make a mad dash for the door.
Dyson hopes that giant spiders are only a Level
10 problem, but of course Level 9 is sure to have
its own horrifying obstacles.
The Player plays out the Scene with Dyson
having to defend against a spider that spilled out
into the hall. Despite this, his plan is successful
and they make their way through the door and up
to Level 9. This level, they discover, has become

While Random Events are unexpected events
that inject themselves into your Scene, like the
spider brawl in the previous Random Event,
they can also be used to help explain something
your Character is already dealing with.
In this example, the Player is using the
Random Event to determine what the mossman is doing. His behavior is the Random
Event. The Player likely would have had to
determine the NPC’s behavior eventually
anyway, maybe with a Fate Question, but
the appearance of the Random Event seemed
like a good opportunity to do so now.
Since this Event is about an NPC, the Player
rolls on the Characters Elements Meaning
Table and gets “Frantic” and “Ambush”. An
interpretation immediately springs to mind.
The moss-man, aware of their presence, begins
to franticly wave his arms in a slow, shambling
way, seemingly trying to attack. For a slowmoving, slow-witted moss-man, this might be his
best attempt at an ambush.

55

RANDOM EVENTS

Interpreting the Meaning words of “Frantic” and “Ambush” to mean
the moss-man attacks in its own slow motion frantic way is a bit of
a stretch as an interpretation, but that’s fine. It’s what came to the
Player’s mind and it still fits close enough with the results generated.
“Don’t let him touch you!” Dr. Copenhagen cries as Dyson rushes
the creature and slams him with his shield to knock him back. He just
needs to clear enough room for them to get to the door at the other end
of the room without being turned into walking plants.
They succeed in battering their way past the moss-man and close the
door behind them.
Level 8 is perhaps the strangest level so far, with one of the oddest
mutations. This floor has been taken over by sentient water coolers
that stab people with their water dispenser faucets—which are now
fanged—to suck their blood.
Dyson has witnessed enough of the coolers’ dastardly deeds to know
he doesn’t want to become their next drink. He and Dr. Copenhagen
manage to cobble together a makeshift explosive they hope to use to
clear the cafeteria where a group of vampiric coolers have gathered to
hang out and gossip about humans.
Dyson needs to plant the bomb close enough to hit the coolers, so he
sneaks into the cafeteria. As he crawls across the floor, the Player asks a
Fate Question that triggers a Random Event.
Rolling on the Event Focus Table, they get PC Negative. Uh oh. The
Player rolls on the Actions Meaning Tables to see what’s happening and
gets “Fight” and “Outside”. An interpretation comes easily.
Dyson’s about halfway to the table he wants to stick the bomb under
when a commotion erupts in one of the adjoining halls. Dyson hears
yelling and gunfire.
The coolers in the cafeteria go berserk, angrily sliding around as
they prepare to attack whoever’s out there, probably other survivors also
trying to get to the stairwell.
This is bad timing for Dyson, who’s crouched under a table in the
middle of a cafeteria full of agitated, blood-sucking water coolers.
Of the three Random Events in this example this one was the easiest
for the Player to interpret. A Focus of PC Negative and Meaning
Words of “Fight” and “Outside” immediately suggested an idea to the
Player that fit exactly with Mythic’s prompts. Sometimes that’s how it
is, the Random Event prompts fit so neatly with the current moment
that there’s hardly any interpretation required.

F

ate Questions and Random Events cover almost
anything you could think to ask about in an
adventure and anything unexpected that might
be thrown your way. But before you can get to
playing, there’s one more thing we need to go over:
structure. Without a framework to connect one part
of the narrative to the next, all those Questions and
Events aren’t much more than a jumble of details.
In a typical social role-playing scenario, the
Game Master maintains this structure implicitly,
but solo play requires something more concrete.
Mythic uses a simple Scene structure that’s
mostly there to help you keep track of where your
adventure is going so you’re less likely to get lost
in the weeds.

THERE’S MORE!
This chapter gives you everything you need to
run exciting and effective Mythic adventures,
but there’s more to discover. Once you’ve gotten
the hang of the basics, you can head to the
“Variations” chapter for additional rules on the
mechanics we’ve covered elsewhere in this book,
as well as strategies for dealing with issues you
may encounter along the way.

Elements Of A Scene
Here are the elements common to all Mythic
Scenes that shape our adventures:
» LISTS: A collection of adventure goals to
pursue and Characters to interact with.
» SCENE STRUCTURE: The way you
determine the beginning and end of a
Scene. Besides the First Scene, there are
three kinds of Scenes: Expected, Altered,
and Interrupt.
» PLAYING: The content of a Scene everything that happens and what your
Player Characters do in response. This is
where the adventure takes place.
» BOOKKEEPING: Updating Lists and
the Chaos Factor, usually at the end of a
Scene. If you’re recording your adventure
in some way this is also a good time to
update that record.

MAKING A
BIG SCENE
Scenes are a unit of time we use to identify what’s
going on and who is involved. Think of it like a
movie or show: something happens in the Scene,
and certain Characters are part of the action. When
the main action of the Scene is resolved, the Scene is
over, and the story moves on to the next Scene.
The same is true in traditional social roleplaying. Your Characters enter a room and deal with
what’s inside; they have a surprise encounter in a
forest; they visit a town to procure new equipment.
Something specific happens with certain Characters
in a finite amount of time, and then you move on.
You’re forming Scenes; you just aren’t stating it.
Mythic adventures work the same, but the Scene
structure is explicit instead of implicit. This makes
it easier to keep track of everything as you go.

59

SCENES

ELEMENTS OF A SCENE

PREPARING LISTS
Before you begin an adventure you need to
get your Adventure Lists ready. You can find the
Adventure Lists sheet in the “Random Events”
chapter and at the back of this book.
Often you’ll start with a fresh, empty set
of Lists, but you can populate your Lists with
any elements you’d like to begin the adventure
with. There are many reasons you might do
this. Maybe you already have some ideas, like
interesting Characters to encounter or a starting
goal to pursue. Or maybe this adventure is part
of an ongoing campaign, and you want to add
Characters and Threads from previous adventures.
Adding elements to your Lists before you begin
is a good way to seed your adventure with ideas.
Mythic will take these ideas and weave them into
the narrative as you play, guiding you toward the
experience you want.
The Player is beginning a fantasy adventure
of court intrigue in which the PC is the royal
magician. They’ve been thinking about this
adventure for some time so they’re coming to the
table with a few ideas.
They have a couple NPCs in mind, so they
add them to the Characters List: King Renfry,
the royal family, and the castle staff. These
Characters will develop organically through the
adventure. The Player also has a goal in mind for
the PC—“Survive court politics”—which they
add to the Threads List. This gets the ball rolling
for the themes and tropes they want to explore.
That’s everything the Player’s come up with for
the adventure going in. Now it’s up to Mythic to
help them shape it all into something interesting.

THREADS &
CHARACTERS LISTS
There are two Lists that will help you
keep track of the important elements in your
adventure: the Threads List for the PC’s goals
and the Characters List for the various NPCs that

60

SCENES

Characters List

populate the adventure
world. These Lists
are important for the
development of your
adventure—they’re
what Mythic uses to
bring the important
adventure elements into
play whenever you roll on
the Event Focus Table.
If you get the Event
Focus of NPC Action
for a Random Event,
for example, then
you would roll on
the Characters
List to see which
NPC was acting,
while getting the result of
Move Toward A Thread
would call for a roll on
the Threads List to see
which Thread you’d be
making progress on.

The Characters List is where
you record important Non-Player
Characters and other active adventure
elements as the PC encounters them.
It’s up to you to decide whether a
Character is important enough to
make the List, but a good rule
of thumb is to add anything or
anyone that can influence the
adventure.
The PC starts the adventure
with the first mate of his
stranded ship, “Tocky
McAdams”, on the
Characters List. Later,
when the PC runs afoul of a
particularly bad-tempered bird
of prey, the Player decides to add
“Bertha the Angry Avian” to the
List so she’s more likely to make
another appearance.

Threads List

NON-CHARACTER ELEMENTS
In Mythic terms, a Character is anything
your PC can interact with in some way, shape, or
form. This category isn’t exclusive to people and
creatures—anything can be a Character as long as
it has some activity of its own.

Threads are the quests, tasks, and missions you
choose to pursue through your Player Character.
You can make anything into an open Thread at
any time by writing it on the Threads List. Once
a Thread has been added to the List it becomes an
important part of your adventure and will likely be
invoked by Random Events.

LOCATIONS
Adding locations to your Characters List is a
good way to draw out interesting encounters linked
to those places.

The Player’s pulp-era sailor, marooned on an
island of dinosaurs and strange prehistoric
creatures, starts out with the Threads “Find a way
off the island” and “Locate missing crewmembers.”
Later in the adventure, after learning about a
magic stone that heals wounds, the Player adds the
Thread “Find the mystical stone.”

The island the PC’s stranded on is thick with
jungle plants and wild animals, and there are
many natural dangers from quicksand to sudden
cliffs. The Player decides to make the jungle itself
a Character by adding “Jungle” to the Characters
List. A Random Event invoking the jungle as an
NPC could involve a danger or boon from the

61

SCENES

jungle itself, such as being attacked by a wild
animal or discovering a source of drinkable water.

ADDING EVENTS TO THE LIST

GROUPS
Including a group as a Character is a good
way to represent a common type of NPC in your
adventure. In our pulp adventure, the Player
might put “Dinosaurs” on the Characters List as
a catchall for any dinosaur the PC comes across.
In a medieval fantasy adventure, the Player might
add “Townspeople” to represent any random
character the PC might meet in town.
As Random Events create encounters with a
group, Mythic may generate individual NPCs
you can also add to your Characters List. This
is a great way to introduce a general class of
Characters to your adventure that becomes more
detailed with specific NPCs as you play.

Adding events to the Characters list (especially
before your adventure begins) is a great way
to seed your adventure with desired situations
without knowing exactly when or how Mythic
will add them in. This helps you make sure you
have the kind of adventure you want while still
maintaining a level of surprise.
For example, an adventure set in a zombie
apocalypse might include “A horde appears”
or “A zombie attacks!” as elements on the
Characters List. This increases the chances of
encountering wandering zombie hordes and
experiencing random zombie attacks in your
adventure, which is exactly what you want in a
zombie apocalypse!
Just like with other Characters, treat an event
as something that can act on its own. An Event
Focus of NPC Action that invokes “A zombie
attacks!” from your Characters List means this
Random Event is about a zombie attacking. If the
Event Focus invoking “A zombie attacks!” is NPC
Negative, then maybe the attacking zombie is at a
disadvantage, such as being trapped in a car and
unable to reach the PC once they move away. As
with any other Random Event, the Meaning Tables
will give you more specific details.

OBJECTS
Much like locations, objects that can act on
their own make good Characters. A starship
prone to mechanical problems might go on
your Characters List to represent adventure
opportunities when the ship has a sudden and
unexpected system failure.
WHEN TO ADD
SOMETHING TO THE LIST
Adding non-character elements to the
Characters List is a judgement call on your
part. My advice is to consider whether adding
the non-character element will enhance your
adventure. If you expect trouble in Rattlesnake
Gulch during your western adventure, or if you
want an increased chance of surprises while
you’re in town, then you may want to add it
as a Character. If, on the other hand, you only
expect this location to serve as the place your
PC meets with the sheriff, you may decide not
to give it the added emphasis of being on the
Characters List.

Likewise, it’s your choice whether to add
traditional NPCs to the List when they show up
in your adventure. The sheriff might be important
because he’s your contact for finding bounties to
hunt down, or he might just be there to kickstart
a Thread. The bartender at the local saloon might
be important because she’s a good source of local
gossip, or she might just be there to give your PC
a drink.
In the end, deciding what should be an active
element in your adventure comes down to
expectations and your own desires.

62

SCENES

Updating Lists

SEEDING LISTS

Lists are updated during the Bookkeeping
phase at the end of a Scene with anything you
didn’t add during play. This is when you decide
which Characters in the Scene were important
enough to add to the Characters List and whether
anything stands out as a goal you want to add to
the Threads List.

The start of a new adventure leaves you faced
with a pair of stark, blank Lists. These Lists will
gradually fill with Threads and Characters as the
adventure unfolds, but the First Scene presents
you with a unique opportunity to jumpstart the
process and make your Lists a little less lonely.
Maybe you have certain goals you want to
achieve or NPCs you want to encounter, or maybe
you’re importing Threads and Characters from
previous adventures as part of an ongoing series.
Regardless of your reasons, you can start your
adventure with any elements you want already on
your Lists.

SCENE STRUCTURE
Time in Mythic adventures is conceptualized
as cinematic Scenes in which the action of your
adventure occurs. Scenes usually take place at
certain locations, involve certain Characters,
and revolve around certain actions or events.
When these actions or events are resolved, the
Scene is over.
A Scene could be your warrior PC exploring
a dungeon chamber, or your smuggler PC
meeting with a potential new client, or your
cryptozoologist PC searching for a mysterious
creature in the forest.
The amount of narrative time a Scene
encompasses is up to you—it could be the fifteen
minutes it takes to explore a room or the year it
takes your PC to hone their swordsmanship skills.
No matter what time frame you’re dealing with,
the Scene is about something specific.
There are four types of Scenes: the First
Scene, Expected Scenes, Altered Scenes, and
Interrupt Scenes.

Another way to pre-build your Lists is with the
creation of your First Scene. No matter which
strategy you go with—Inspired Idea, Random
Event, Meaning Tables, or 4Ws—you can use
elements from your opening prompt to seed your
Lists before you start playing.
If, for example, you were using the Inspired Idea of
your psychic Character journeying into the astral
realm in search of their missing friend, you could
put “Find my friend” as a Thread and “Lost friend”
on the Characters List. Starting your adventure with
these elements on the Lists allows you to make
early-game Random Events even more meaningful.

INSPIRED IDEA
Mythic adventures are full of surprises, but you
can always start with a fully formed idea of your
own. You can think of these as “what if” ideas,
such as “What if my cybernetic superhero PC gets
a lead on the shadowy organization that created
him?” Starting with an idea that excites you
makes for a solid beginning that will lead to a
solid adventure.

THE FIRST SCENE
The First Scene of your adventure is a special
one because it gets the story rolling. There are a
few different ways you can come up with a First
Scene depending on how much Context you’re
starting with and how surprised you want to be.

The Player Character in a sword-and-sorcery
fantasy world is a knight named Weyland.
Weyland’s Player wants to come up with their own
First Scene. Since this is their first time playing
Weyland they only have a handful of ideas about

63

SCENES

FIRST SCENE STRATEGIES

RANDOM EVENT
If you want to start surprised or don’t have
anything in mind you can generate a Random
Event to use as inspiration for your First Scene.
Since this is the beginning of your adventure
there’s a good chance that your Threads and
Characters Lists will be empty. Ignore any result
from the Event Focus Table that calls for an
element from an empty List and use Current
Context as the Focus instead, just like you would
during a regular Random Event.
You may not have a lot of Context to draw
from yet, especially if you’re starting from
scratch, but you aren’t completely empty-handed:
you have a PC, a setting, and an idea of what
you’d like to see in this adventure, especially if
you’re using a chosen RPG that’s built around a
specific world or genre. This is more than enough
to form an interpretation for the First Scene.
Mythic will hone your adventure with more
specific goals and ideas as you play, but at this
stage the possibilities are wide open and all you
need are the Context and the Meaning Tables to
get things off to a good start.
Weyland’s Player decides to start the adventure
with a Random Event. They roll for the Event
Focus and get NPC Negative. Since there aren’t
any NPCs on the Characters List they ignore this
roll and treat the Current Context as the Focus.
Then they roll on the Actions Meaning Tables
and get “Praise” and “Hope”.

who he is. They want to use this adventure as a
way to flesh him out as a Character, starting with
his desire to be a hero.

The Player interprets the Random Event this
way: Weyland is making camp after a long day
of trekking through the forest when he hears
someone approaching. He rises to his feet, his
sword drawn.

The Player chooses this for their First Scene:
Weyland has entered a wild part of the kingdom
where monsters are known to wander freely and
terrorize local villages. He travels to one such
village, whose locals are said to cower in their
homes at night for fear of the creature that’s preying
upon them. Weyland intends to root out the
monster and end its reign of terror once and for all.

A haggard man stumbles out from the trees, and
his desperate eyes lock on to the rabbit roasting
over the fire. He beseeches Weyland for food,
saying he’s been lost in the woods and starving for
many days. This becomes the basis for the First
Scene of the adventure.

64

SCENES

FIRST SCENE 4W STRATEGY

MEANING TABLES
You can skip the Event Focus altogether and
go straight to the Meaning Tables for inspiration,
rolling up as many word pairs as you need to
string together an opening narrative.
Weyland’s Player decides to fish for a different
idea by skipping the Random Event and simply
rolling word pairs on the Meaning Tables. On
the Actions Meaning Tables, they get “Observe”
and “Benefits”. They move to the Locations
Elements Meaning Table for a starting location
and get “Enclosed” and “Extravagant”.
This is how the Player interprets these results:
Weyland has been tasked by his king to spy on a
neighboring nation that appears to be prepping for
war. His job is to pose as a soldier in their military
long enough to assess the strength of their forces.
He successfully falls in line with a column of
recruits marching towards a garrison. Once
inside, he finds the outpost to be much more
lavish and well-guarded than a standard border
keep. Something is going on here and Weyland
aims to figure out what.

THE 4W
A more structured way to use Meaning Tables
for the first Scene is to apply a 4W approach:
Who, What, Where, and Why. You can roll
for these in whatever order you find the most
logical; you can even add How or When if a
randomized method or time period would add
something meaningful to your adventure.
WHO: To find out Who is primarily
involved in the Scene roll on the Characters
Elements Meaning Table and go with whatever
interpretation makes sense, whether that’s your
own PC, an existing NPC, or a new NPC
inspired by the word pair.
WHAT: Roll on the Actions Meaning tables to
see What the main activity of the Scene will be.

65

SCENES

WHERE: For the location Where the main
activity is taking place roll on the Locations
Elements Meaning Table. Just like with Who, this
can be any new or existing location that fits the
word pair.
WHY: Roll on the Actions Meaning Tables to
learn the motivations behind Why the Characters
are taking these actions.
Once you have your 4Ws combine them into the
most interesting interpretation you can think of.

When the Player Character gets to the party he
sees an assortment of undead in varying stages of
decay socializing with each other. The festival is
spirited (though the PC dares not eat any of the
food served), but the undead revelers have a goal
beyond merrymaking: they hope to open a portal to
the Underworld so they can all return to rest. The
festival is one part celebration of unlife and one
part conference as they invite local mages to help
them solve their dilemma.

The PC is a modern mage living in Los Angeles.
The Player has no idea what the adventure will be
about and they want to be surprised.

The Player is happy with this interpretation and
decides to add these ideas to their Lists before
beginning the adventure. To the Threads List they
add “Help the undead return to the Underworld”;
to the Characters List they add “Community of
undead” and “Other mages at the festival”. The
Player is now ready to begin their adventure with
a nicely detailed First Scene.

Starting with Who, the Player rolls on the
Characters Elements Meaning Table to get
“Excited” and “Unusual”. Interesting. The Player
decides to wait until they have more information to
attempt an interpretation.
Next is What. Rolling on the Actions Meaning
Tables gives the Player “Fail” and “Portal”. Hmm,
a failed portal … Again the Player decides to hold
off on interpreting for now.
For Where the Player rolls on the Locations
Elements Meaning Table and gets “Lively” and
“Festive”. This sounds like a party or festival.
Finally, the Player rolls for Why on the Actions
Tables and gets “Travel” and “Project”.
So, they have a Who of “Excited” and
“Unusual”, a What of “Fail” and “Portal”, a
Where of “Lively” and “Festive”, and a Why of
“Travel” and “Project”.
The Player thinks about this for a moment then
they decide on this interpretation: The PC has
been invited to a special Day of the Dead Festival.
The partygoers themselves are dead—or rather,
undead. They are a community of beings who
have been summoned by spellcasters over the years.
Unable to return to the afterlife, they now live
quietly in Los Angeles searching for a way to get
back to where they belong.

SCENES

EXPECTED SCENES

Testing The Expected Scene

Mythic adventures move fluidly from one
Scene to the next, with each new Scene adding
details to the growing narrative. New plot twists
develop, new Threads are discovered, and new
NPCs emerge, while existing Characters take
new actions. Every choice you make affects the
outcome of future Scenes as you strive to achieve
your goals, fulfill open Threads, and reach a
satisfying conclusion.
When a Scene comes to an end the first thing
you do before beginning the next one is decide
how you think it’ll start, usually based on what
you want your PC to do next. This is called an
Expected Scene.

Before we dive into the new Scene we have
to check if your expectations happen using the
Chaos Factor. Roll a d10 and compare it to
the current CF value. If you roll above the CF
then the Expected Scene starts exactly how you
thought it would; if you roll equal to or less than
the CF then your Expected Scene changes in
some way.
In cases when your Expected Scene is changed
check the number you rolled. If the number is
odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) then it becomes an Altered
Scene; if the number is even (2, 4, 6, or 8) then it
becomes an Interrupt Scene.

The First Scene of the Player’s adventure saw
their detective Character visited in his office
by a mysterious new client begging him to
investigate the murder of her late husband. The
police ruled his death a suicide, but she thinks
otherwise. Through her, the PC learned that
the victim owed a great deal of money to an old
army buddy who threatened his life if he didn’t
pay it back—a promising lead with which to
start the investigation.

TESTING THE EXPECTED SCENE
Roll 1d10 and Compare It To The Chaos Factor.

With the opening Scene concluded the Player
must now decide how they think the next Scene
will begin. They decide the Expected Scene is
about their PC dropping in on the suspect at his
place of work to question him.

Roll Over

ALTERED SCENES

Most of the time the Expected Scene will be
based on what you decide your Character plans
to do. Our detective Character wants to follow
up on a lead so that forms the basis of the Player’s
Expected Scene.
Whatever your Expected Scene is you won’t
know for sure whether or not it will happen that
way until you test it.

If your Expected Scene becomes an Altered
Scene then the Scene begins in the next most
expected way, as though Mythic heard your idea
and said, “Let’s try something else instead.” The
Altered Scene may be nearly identical to the
Expected Scene except for one detail, or it may
be quite different, but it must make sense for it to
happen instead of the Expected Scene.

67

SCENES

ALTERED SCENE STRATEGIES

The Player’s Expected Scene of the detective
dropping in on a suspect at work is changed to
an Altered Scene. They decide that the next most
expected Scene would be the PC discovering that
the suspect isn’t at work and dropping by his
home instead.
Below are some ideas for coming up with
Altered Scenes.

The Next Expectation
This is the default method, as explained above:
Mythic said No to the Scene you expected, so go
with whatever Scene you’d most expect besides
that one.

A Tweak
Altering a Scene can be as simple as making a
single tweak to your Expected Scene.
In a fantasy adventure, the local forest spirits are
lashing out at the forest’s inhabitants. The Player
Character is trying to figure out what angered
the spirits when a wild fire breaks out. The next
Expected Scene is the PC venturing into the fire
zone to find what caused it, but when the Player
tests that Expected Scene an Altered Scene is
triggered instead.
The Player decides to stick to the Expected Scene
with one small tweak: instead of needing to
investigate, the PC immediately finds the fire
spirit that started the blaze. Now the Player can
begin the Scene by playing out the encounter.
Think about all the different elements of an
Expected Scene: the activity taking place, the
NPCs involved, the objects of importance, and
the location it all happens in. A change to any of
these elements would give you an Altered Scene.
Since our Expected Scene with the forest fire
had no NPCs in it, adding a Character, the fire
spirit, was an easy tweak. The activity in this
Scene is the fire itself, so tweaking that could

68

SCENES

mean that the fire is bigger or smaller than
expected. There were no important objects in our
Expected Scene so a tweak there could be adding
one, like a magical stone provided by an ally to
protect the PC from the fire.

FIND YOUR STYLE
This section covers a number of strategies for
turning an Expected Scene into an Altered Scene.
The method you choose will depend on how
you like to play and how easy it is to modify the
Expected Scene you’re working with.

Fate Question
If you’re not quite sure how to Alter the Scene,
or you have several ideas with no clear winner, you
can always ask a Fate Question to help you choose.

If you’re fine with assuming some narrative control
over your adventure, and the Expected Scene
has an obvious second choice, then The Next
Expectation or A Tweak is probably the way to go.
If you want more randomness, aren’t sure how
to Alter the Scene, or simply feel uncomfortable
assuming that much control, then a Fate Question,
Meaning Tables Inspiration, or Scene Adjustment
Table roll may be more to your liking.

In an occult horror adventure set in ancient
Rome, the Player’s Roman soldier Character is
investigating reports of cattle going missing in the
countryside. The PC, along with a handful of
fellow soldiers, has spent several Scenes marching
deeper into the hills, encountering signs of rituals
and black magic.

As you role-play using Mythic you’ll likely find
yourself favoring one of these strategies most of
the time and using a second one as backup based
on what best fits your style of play and adds the
most fun to your game.

The current Scene ends when the PC returns to
camp one night and finds his compatriots missing.
The Player decides that the Expected Scene is this:
“I arm myself and go into the woods in search of
the soldiers.”

An Exceptional Yes might mean taking Yes one
step further and finding not just footprints but a
live soldier.

A roll against the Chaos Factor turns this into an
Altered Scene. The Player has a couple of ideas
for Alterations: finding footprints of the soldiers
leading into the woods; finding a dead soldier
(which would make sense with how the adventure
has been going lately); finding a soldier who’s still
alive. All three ideas seem equally plausible so the
Player isn’t sure which one it should be. They’re
leaning slightly toward finding footprints as the
alteration so they test this with a Fate Question:
“Is the Altered Scene finding footprints?”

An Exceptional No might mean taking No one
step further and finding multiple dead soldiers.

Meaning Tables Inspiration
Just as the Meaning Tables offer inspiration
for Random Events they can also offer inspiration
for an Altered Scene. Choose whichever Meaning
Table seems the most appropriate given the
Context—Actions, Descriptions, or Elements —
and then roll for a word pair to help you change
the Expected Scene.

With a Yes the Player would go with finding
footprints of the soldiers as the Altered Scene.
A No might mean it’s not footprints that are
found. With that option off the table the next
most likely idea for an alteration is finding a
dead soldier.

In the fantasy adventure about angry spirits the
PC discovered in the previous Scene that the forest
fire was caused by a fire spirit. They successfully
calmed the spirit, halting the spread of the fire,
and learned in the process that the spirits are

69

SCENES

restless because something has disturbed a sacred
space beneath the earth.

SCENE ADJUSTMENT TABLE

In the next Scene, the PC makes their way to the
mouth of a cave that leads deep underground.
Somewhere down there is the sacred space the
spirit mentioned.
The Player decides that the next Expected Scene
is “My Character enters the cave to search for the
sacred space.” Testing that Expected Scene results
in an Altered Scene.
Unsure of how to alter the Scene, the Player seeks
inspiration from the Actions Meaning Tables for
an additional element to Alter the Scene. They roll
“Distrust” and “Innocent” which they interpret
to mean that the ground shakes intermittently
(their reasoning is that the ground is usually solid
and therefore “innocent”, so now it should be
“ distrusted”.) The whole cave seems somewhat
unstable, so cave-ins and other such perils may be
an issue during the exploration ahead.

The Scene ends when they discover an ancient,
crumbling castle nestled in the wilderness.
The Player comes up with a new Expected
Scene: “We enter the castle, our torches held high
to help us search.” When tested this becomes an
Altered Scene. The Player rolls a d10 on the
Scene Adjustment Table and gets Remove A
Character, which they interpret like so: “When
we approach the castle the terrified soldier
refuses to venture inside, too scared to go any
further. I must go in alone.”

Scene Adjustment Table
For a more randomized Tweak, roll a d10
and consult the Scene Adjustment Table to see
what element changes in your Expected Scene.
Options include adding or removing a Character,
changing the intensity of an activity, and adding
or removing an object. Interpret the result in the
Context of your Expected Scene to change it. If
you roll a result that isn’t possible in the current
Context (such as Remove A Character when the
Expected Scene didn’t mention any Characters),
roll again.

Let’s go over each of the table’s possible results.

REMOVE A CHARACTER
Choose the most logical Character to remove
from the Expected Scene.
In the example above, the Player would remove
the frightened soldier since he was the only other
Character in the Expected Scene. If there were
no NPCs in the Expected Scene then the Player

In the ancient Roman horror adventure, the
Player Character finds one of his comrades in

a creature that attacked him and dragged the
others away.
In the next Scene, the PC and his terrified
companion comb the forest in search of the others.

ADD A CHARACTER

INCREASE AN ACTIVITY

Choose the most logical NPC on the
Characters List and add them to the Scene.
Sticking with our Roman horror adventure,
a Scene Adjustment Table result of Add A
Character could mean that the PC and his
companion encounter another missing soldier as
they enter the crumbling castle.

Increase the intensity of an activity in the
Expected Scene.
Sticking with the forest fire, a roll of Increase
An Activity could indicate that the fire is much
bigger than originally envisioned, and the PC will
need to be very careful if they’re going to venture
into it.

REDUCE/REMOVE AN ACTIVITY

REMOVE AN OBJECT

Reduce the intensity of an active element in
your Expected Scene, or remove it completely if
that makes more sense.
In the earlier example with the restless spirits,
the forest fire was an active element in the
Expected Scene. A Scene Adjustment Table result
of Reduce/Remove An Activity could indicate
that the fire is of lesser intensity than originally
expected, perhaps just a wisp of smoke signaling
the start of a fire.

Remove a significant object in your Expected
Scene, choosing whichever object makes the
most sense.
For the Roman example, maybe the PC and his
companion enter the castle only for their torches
to run out of fuel and gutter out.

ADD AN OBJECT

EXAMPLES OF CHANGED SCENES

Add a significant object to your Expected
Scene. If nothing logical comes to mind you can
roll for inspiration on the Meaning Tables.
Perhaps as the Roman Characters enter the
castle the PC sees a sword lying on the ground
that belonged to one of the missing soldiers,
indicating that they were brought this way.

EXPECTED SCENE: A fantasy warrior PC is
exploring the Dungeon of Fel-Azar, an ancient
undead wizard. After checking a few cobwebby
rooms and battling a giant scorpion, the PC
makes her way down a corridor by torchlight. The
Player expects the next Scene to be checking out
another room to see what’s in it.

MAKE 2 ADJUSTMENTS

ALTERED SCENE: Instead of exploring the next
room the PC has an encounter in the corridor.

Make two adjustments to the Expected Scene
instead of one, rolling on the Scene Adjustment
Table until you have determined both
adjustments. If this result is generated again
simply ignore it and reroll. If you roll two results
that conflict with each other ignore the second
roll and just use the first.

INTERRUPT SCENE: The Player rolls PC Negative
on the Event Focus Table and gets “Ambush”
and “Pain” on the Actions Meaning Tables. They
interpret this to mean that their Character springs
a trap as she makes her way down the corridor.

EXPECTED SCENE: A post-apocalyptic PC sneaks
through an enemy encampment at night to steal
gasoline for his vehicle.

INTERRUPT SCENES

ALTERED SCENE: The PC finds a cache of fuel
right away, but it’s guarded by two soldiers.
Instead of sneaking through the camp the Scene
will be about overcoming the guards without
raising an alarm.

While Altered Scenes play off your
expectations, Interrupt Scenes ignore them
entirely; anything can happen.
If your Expected Scene becomes an Interrupt
Scene, then Mythic derails your expectations
to send the narrative in a new and unforeseen
direction. You generate an Interrupt Scene the
same way you’d generate a Random Event: roll
for the Event Focus and Event Meaning, then
interpret the results in Context.

INTERRUPT SCENE: The Event Focus Table gives
NPC Negative with the NPC result of “Choose”.
The Player chooses “Enemy warband” since
that’s who the PC is currently robbing. The
Event Meaning Tables give “Punish” and “Battle”.
The Player comes up with this interpretation:
Before the PC can attempt his planned theft the
encampment is attacked by a rival road gang,
resulting in all-out battle the PC will have to
survive long enough to swipe the fuel he needs.

The detective PC investigating the death of his
client’s husband is about to visit a suspect at his

together organically. Maybe your Character
finishes ransacking a room and leaves to explore
the dungeon further, and you get an Altered
Scene that you interpret as a monster in the hall.
Interrupt Scenes disturb that flow of events,
so it may not be immediately obvious how it
connects to your previous Scene. Keep in mind
that this Event is interrupting the expected
transition from one Scene to the next. If you take
into account how the previous Scene ended and
what the Player Character is currently trying to
do, you should be able to interpret this new Scene
in a way that fits the current Context.
In the example above, the Player Character was
about to drop in on a suspect when the Interrupt
Scene happened. This Context gives the new
Scene a logical tie-in to the adventure.

following Interruption: The PC heads downstairs
from his office to go and pay Johnny Loanshark
a visit, but there’s someone waiting for him.
Leaning against the PC’s car door is a large and
angry-looking man whom the PC unfortunately
recognizes as Ricky No-Thumb.
This Interruption stopped the Expected
Scene from happening and created an entirely
new Scene, one that forces the detective into an
encounter with another Character. Considering
Ricky’s hostile demeanor, this Scene will likely
lead to new revelations about the relationships
between the PC’s client, her dead husband, and
the suspects in his case.

Making Connections
Expected Scenes flow together organically:
they start as you expect them to and follow the
trajectory of the Player Character’s actions. If your
Character chooses to enter a room and search it,
that’s the basis for an Expected Scene. If your
Character then leaves the room and explores the
dungeon further, that’s another Expected Scene.
Altered Scenes are close enough to your
Expected Scene that they,
too, tend to flow

PLAYING OUT
THE SCENE
Once you have the concept for your Scene
ironed out (whether it’s the first Scene, Expected,
Altered, or Interrupted), it’s time to get into the
Scene and do some role-playing! Now the action
of your adventures can take place, with Fate
Questions there to tell you anything you
need to know as you play.
A sci-fi Player Character who stole a set
of blueprints for an off-world client is
fleeing a cybernetic agent tasked with
retrieving them. The PC should be
able to escape if they can make it to their
ship hidden in the foothills.
Their Player rolls an Interrupted Scene that
begins with the agent spotting the PC on
a busy nighttime street. The PC takes off
running, hoping to lose the agent in the crowd.
The Player asks the Fate Question, “Is the area
busy tonight, with lots of people on the street?”

SCENES

giving it Odds of Very Likely. Mythic says Yes.
Their Character pushes through the throng with
the agent in hot pursuit. Strangers yell at them
both as they jostle past, and a car honks its horn
as the PC darts across the street.

MYTHIC WITH ANOTHER RPG
Mythic’s framework (using Fate Questions to
gather information and a Scenes structure
to contain the action) is all about building the
narrative details of your adventure. Fate Questions
are the kinds of things you’d ask a live Game
Master if you were playing with one.

The Player asks, “Do I see any shops that would
be good to duck into?” giving it Odds of 50/50.
Mythic comes back with Exceptional Yes.
The Player interprets this to mean that their
Character spots the perfect place: a fancy multistory restaurant with plenty of people inside
to serve as distraction. The plan is for the PC
to dash inside, run upstairs, and escape out a
window to one of the neighboring buildings.

If you’re using Mythic with another role-playing
game, then Mythic will act as the Game Master by
answering your questions while you use the rules
of your chosen RPG to handle the situations they
cover, such as combat and skill resolution.
When the Player in the earlier sci-fi example asked
a Fate Question to see if the pursuing agent was
close behind, they could have replaced it with a
task resolution roll against the agility skill of the
RPG they were using. If they succeeded on the
agility roll, then the PC would outrun the agent.

The PC bursts into the restaurant, startling a
waiter into dropping a tray of food. Diners cry
out in alarm as the PC sprints across the dining
room and races up the stairs.
The Player asks, “Is the agent close behind me?”
setting the Odds to Unlikely. Mythic comes back
with No. That’s good news—maybe the agent
got bogged down by the crowd like they hoped.

There’s a lot of overlap between what you can
frame as a Fate Question and what can be
resolved with your chosen RPG. How you choose
to handle these uncertainties is up to you, but
Mythic gives you the tools to ask Fate Questions
at any time. You can even use them to replace
certain rules in your RPG, as covered in the “Fate
Questions” chapter.

Now it’s time to make a move and lose him
completely. When the PC reaches the second
floor, the Player asks, “Is there a window I can
go through that leads somewhere?” setting the
Odds to Very Likely. Mythic comes back with
Yes. The PC opens a window and leaps to the
roof of another building.

or Expected Scenes, and sometimes they’re
completely subverted by Random Events or
Interrupt Scenes that introduce unforeseen twists
and turns. Mythic’s mechanics for introducing
the unexpected can change the narrative of your
adventure in ways you never would have guessed.

The action in a Mythic Scene progresses in
this fashion, with Fate Questions helping you plot
your way. Details for the adventure are built Scene
by Scene. The further into an adventure you get,
the more detail your narrative has, until the story
takes on a life of its own.

The Player is using Mythic with their favorite
fantasy RPG to play a solo adventure. Bering
the Magnificent, their fantasy warlock PC, is
attempting to cast a powerful spell that will
summon and bind a demon. The wild magic
required for the summoning means there’s a good
chance of failure or mishap.

Twists & Turns
Your expectations set the standard for what
happens next in your adventure. Sometimes
these expectations are tested with Fate Questions

74

SCENES

After an unfortunate toss of the dice, the Player
determines that Bering’s casting attempt fails,
badly. The RPG rules state that for a casting
failure this bad, the Game Master should come
up with a suitable mishap. Since this is a GMless solo adventure, the Player asks the Fate
Question, “Does something unexpected happen as
a result of the failed spell?” with Odds of Nearly
Certain. Mythic comes back with Yes and a
Random Event.

ADVENTURE JOURNAL SHEET
The Adventure Journal sheet (found on the next
page and in the back of the book) gives you a
place to title your adventure, record the current
Chaos Factor, summarize Scenes in the order they
happen, and write down any other important
notes. This sheet, along with the Adventure Lists
(also found at the back), is all you need to keep
track of your ever-expanding solo adventure.

The Player decides that the Yes means there’s
an explosion that leaves Bering a little burned,
since that seems like the most logical expectation
for the failure of a spell like this. Since they
also got a Random Event, the Player decides to
make it a part of the failed spell mishap. The
Event Focus Table gives them “Introduce New
NPC”, and the Meaning Tables give the words
“Recruit” and “Outside”.

adventure should be a string of interesting Scenes,
with each one leading to the next.
When a Scene ends, and you’re ready for the
next one, come up with an Expected Scene for what
you think that Scene will be about. If your PC is
a superhero who just thwarted a robot rampage
downtown, then the Expected Scene might be your
Character meeting up with their scientist friend to
figure out where the robot came from.
Coming up with an Expected Scene is a
starting point for that Scene. Mythic will tell
you whether the Scene starts as you expect or is
changed into an Altered or Interrupt Scene.
Below are some ways to determine when to
start and end a Scene.

The Player interprets this to mean that although
the spell failed to summon a demon, it did
summon someone from the future. This is an
unexpected twist in the adventure. Not only
does the rest of the Scene play out in a way the
Player didn’t expect, but the whole course of the
adventure changes direction as Bering figures out
what to do with this stranger from a distant era.

INTEREST

Beginning And Ending Scenes

The default approach to starting and ending
Scenes is to focus on points of interest: start a
Scene when something interesting happens and
end it when the interesting event is over.

Just as the time frame of a Scene is up to you,
so too are its beginning and ending. A Scene may
start when your Character physically enters an area
and end when they leave, but that’s only one way
of doing it. Time can just as easily mark the start
and end of Scenes. If you have a Scene in which
your Character checks out a cave to make sure
it’s safe before camping there for the night, then
your next Scene might begin in the same location
the next morning. Let yourself be guided by your
interests and the main action of the Scene. Your

The Player is playing a sci-fi investigation game
set in the big city. Their PC is a cybernetically
enhanced police officer on the hunt for an

picked up a few clues, including evidence that the
android is getting tech from the black market.

SCENE START AND
END STRATEGIES

The Player considers what’s catching their
interest. The PC could look up an underworld
contact to question them for leads, or stake out
a black-market dealer in hopes of spotting the
fugitive android, or meet with a colleague in the
police department who might be able to point
him in the right direction. All of these are valid
Expected Scenes that are based on what is most
interesting to the Player and what action they
want their Character to take.
The Player settles on the PC visiting an
underworld contact to question them. Now,
what’s the most interesting way to start the
Scene? The Player decides that the PC meets his
contact at their “office”, a café that serves as a
front for illicit activities. The Scene consists of
the PC sitting at a table to chat with them about
illegal weapons deals.
After a few Fate Questions, the PC starts to get
nervous. His contact is being evasive, and there’s
an unusual amount of muscle in the room. Is this
a setup?
The tension snaps when the contact signals for
the bodyguards to gang up on the PC and kill
him. In the ensuing brawl, the PC manages to
hold them off long enough to leap out a window
and escape.
The Player could decide to continue this Scene
by having the PC search for a safe place to hide,
but the original point of interest was the meeting.
After the fight and the escape, this point of
interest has ended—a good sign that the Scene
should come to a close.

TIME OR LOCATION
A jump in time or change in location is
another way to mark the transition from one
Scene to the next.
The PC is a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world.
She spent a Scene exploring a wrecked airplane

77

SCENES

The Player ends the Scene there and decides
that the next Expected Scene should be the PC
visiting his underworld contact at the café. The
meeting goes smoothly at first, but then it turns
violent. This time, instead of playing out the
fight like they did in the previous example, the
Player stops the Scene here because it represents a
shift in the narrative. The next Expected Scene
is how the Player thinks this situation is going to
go down. The PC is still at the café, still meeting
with the contact, and is just about to get into
a fight. The time, place, and situation haven’t
changed, but the narrative focus has.

and decided to make camp there for the night. If
the Player wanted a time-based transition, then
the Scene could end with her bunking down, and
the new Scene could start when she wakes up a
few hours later; if the Player wanted a locationbased transition, then the Scene could end when
the PC completes her exploration of the wreck
and moves on.

NARRATIVE SHIFT
Instead of viewing Scenes as discrete units of
activity or interest, another way to view them is as
a continuous stream whose transitions are marked
by narrative shifts. Let’s revisit our earlier example.

By placing the emphasis on narrative shifts, you
get a greater degree of control over how those shifts
play out.

The cybernetic cop is investigating a crime scene
when he finds evidence of illegal weaponry.
That’s a shift in the narrative, a dramatic new
piece of information that changes the Context of
the adventure.

The Player’s Expected Scene is that two of the
bodyguards pull guns on the PC and rush at
him while his contact slips away. Details like
this would normally be determined with Fate

78

SCENES

Questions (e.g., “Do a couple of guards come at
me with guns?”), but the Player is using them as
an Expected Scene instead.

SIMULATIONIST VERSUS THEATRICAL

MOOD

Solo play styles can broadly be broken down
into two categories: simulationist and theatrical.
A simulationist Player wants their adventure to
emulate a virtual reality, with events proceeding
in a logical fashion regardless of whether they
serve a larger plot. A theatrical Player, on the
other hand, is more interested in treating the
adventure like an ongoing story, with all the
narrative structure one would expect.

Similar to basing Scenes on narrative shifts,
you can also base Scenes on mood shifts, ending
a Scene when you feel that the mood of the
adventure has changed. This doesn’t have to
involve interest, time, place, or story changes—it’s
entirely based on how you feel.

Both styles of play have differing expectations. A
simulationist player tends to prioritize surprises,
while a theatrical player tends to prioritize
drama and tension. Each of the suggested
strategies for starting and ending Scenes fits
one style or either.

The Scene then plays out along the established
narrative lines—a big brawl in this case. When
the PC leaps through a window and escapes, the
narrative shifts again, and it’s time for a new
Expected Scene.

The Player’s fantasy barbarian is exploring a
dungeon. She goes from room to room, killing
monsters, claiming loot, and surviving traps.

SCENE
STYLE

If the Player were taking an interest-based
approach, they might make each room its own
Scene, building up curiosity for every search. A
time- or location-based approach would be much
the same, with Scenes changing as the PC moves
from one portion of the dungeon to the next.
Using narrative shifts, the PC might spend the
same Scene exploring rooms and hallways until
something new happens, like encountering a
monster or springing a trap, and then start a new
Scene to play out this event.

With a mood-based approach, the Player might
do any of the above or none of them. Maybe
busting into rooms and battling beasts and
springing traps all fit their current mood, so the
Player keeps going until it gets old and they want
something different to happen. Their mood is
shifting, so it’s time for a new Scene.

AUTOMATIC INTERRUPT
Your adventure is moving along nicely until
you hit a dead end in the narrative. You have
no idea where to go from here or what the next
Expected Scene should be. Now what?
This dilemma happens in traditional, guided
role-playing, too. Maybe the Players missed some
cues earlier in the adventure, or maybe they didn’t
choose the route the GM expected them to take,

79

SCENES

to interact with and should be enough to get you
back in the groove.
If you want to take it a step further, you can
also skip the Event Focus Table and make the
Focus an automatic Move Toward A Thread.
This guarantees that the Scene will bring your PC
closer to resolving an open goal, thus moving the
adventure forward.

THE MULTI APPROACH
Here is a summary of the five strategies for
starting and ending Scenes.
»

INTEREST: Scenes are based on a goal or
activity. (The default method.)

»

TIME OR LOCATION: Scenes are triggered by
a change in time or location.

»

NARRATIVE SHIFT: Scenes end when
something important happens that shifts the
focus of the adventure.

»

MOOD: Scenes end when you feel like it’s time
to energize the adventure with a new Scene.

»

AUTOMATIC INTERRUPT: The new Scene is
automatically an Interrupt. (Best for when you
feel stuck on what should happen next.)

The Player’s barbarian has explored much of the
dungeon, overcoming traps and battling restless
undead. At this point the Player isn’t sure what
should happen next. They’ve generated room
after room, using Fate Questions and Meaning
Tables to determine encounters, but now they
think something should happen to give the
dungeon crawl more flavor.
The Player has a few different goals on their
Threads list, including to find the dungeon’s
fabled treasure. They could make something
happen with an Expected Scene, like “The PC
finds a clue about the treasure”, but that feels too
much like railroading, and they want to keep
some level of surprise.

You can use any one of these strategies in your
adventure, or you can switch them up as needed.
Maybe you normally base Scenes on interest,
but the current Scene isn’t going anywhere
interesting, so you use a shift in location to mark
the end of the Scene instead. A few Scenes later,
things start to feel stale, so you end the current
Scene based on mood and start a new one. When
the adventure heats up later on with a lot going
on at once, you use a narrative shift to break
things off into a new Scene so the fast-paced
action stays relatively organized.

They decide to let Mythic choose what happens
next by making the next Scene an automatic
Interrupt Scene. This way they don’t have to
come up with an Expected Scene or roll against
the Chaos Factor.

Each method has its own distinct feel, and there’s
no right answer for which to use when. Do
whatever works best for you.

Since they want this Interrupt Scene to progress
the adventure, the Player also chooses to make
the Event Focus an automatic Move Toward A
Thread. Whatever the next Scene is about, the
Player knows it will be something unexpected
that pushes the PC toward one of their goals.

derailing an important part of the adventure.
However it happened, The Players find themselves
at a loss for what to do next. This is the point
where a savvy Game Master will make something
happen to get the PCs back on track.
You can simulate this intervention with
Mythic by choosing to make the next Scene an
automatic Interrupt Scene. Skip the roll against
the Chaos Factor and go straight into generating
a Random Event. This will create something new

The Many Questions Pitfall
With Fate Questions always ready to give you
information, it’s tempting to fish for more specific
answers. While you can ask as many Questions as

80

SCENES

you like, asking too many can easily slow down
your game.

LEADING WITH EXPECTATIONS

Edward, a pirate Player Character, finally
locates the Cove of Sorrows that houses the
treasure hoard he’s been searching for.

Asking as few Fate Questions as possible keeps
the game moving swiftly, since most of the details
in your adventure can be derived from your
expectations. When you’re no longer certain
about what happens that’s when you ask another
Fate Question. Mythic adventures flow from Fate
Question to Fate Question, with your expectations
filling the gaps in between.

The Player asks the Fate Question, “Is the
treasure just as the stories foretold?” Mythic
comes back with a Yes.
The Player wants more information, so they ask,
“Is it mostly gold?” Mythic says No.

Whether you’re playing solo or using Mythic to
guide a group adventure, the goal is to have fun
and enjoy the experience. To that end it’s helpful
when interpreting Mythic’s answers to trust
your gut and listen to your instincts. Tapping
into your imagination will turn Mythic prompts
into opportunities for you to run with your
expectations, leading to wonderful improvisation
as new ideas are unleashed.

“Is it mostly jewels?” Mythic says Exceptional Yes.
The Player interprets this to mean there is some
gold here and there, but the jewels are piled high.
In the example above, the Player asked three
Questions to get a sense of what the treasure
hoard looked like, but they could have stopped
after the first one, “Is the treasure just as the
stories foretold?” There is so much expectation
and Context behind that Question. The Player
could have run with it, improvising a description
of the treasure based on what they expected, since
Mythic confirmed that the treasure is “just as the
stories foretold”.
A good rule of thumb is to try and limit
yourself to one single Question for a given
situation. If that doesn’t give you enough to go
on, ask a second one. Most of the time your
expectations will take over from there.
Keep in mind that there are four possible
answers to any Fate Question: Yes, No,
Exceptional Yes, and Exceptional No. This gives
you a nice range of potential outcomes with just
one Question.

YES: It’s just as the stories say. There are heaps
of gold and jewels pouring from overstuffed
chests, fine art and antiquities stolen from long
lost ships, and weapons from warlords forgotten
to time.
NO: The stories exaggerated. There are a few
chests stuffed with gold and jewels, but the hoard
isn’t as epic as you hoped.
EXCEPTIONAL YES: The hoard is beyond
what the stories say, with more gold and jewels
than you could fit on your ship. The cavern is
stuffed with it, the ceiling shimmering with the
reflections of a nation’s worth of wealth.
EXCEPTIONAL NO: There’s nothing but
empty chests and a few gold pieces scattered on
the ground—someone beat you to the plunder.

In the pirate example above, the Question, “Is
the treasure just as the stories foretold?” has four
possible answers, each drawing from expectations
based on the Context of the adventure so far. The
interpreted answers could be something like this:

In this example one Question leads to four very
different results, and each result is packed with
a wealth of detail just from expectations; there’s
hardly any need to ask for more information.

Tension Building Questions

Mythic adventure will happen when you ask a
hard Question whose answer you’re genuinely
worried about. How will Mythic respond?
What will happen to the PC? These are exciting
moments, the kind of moments you’ll remember
long after the adventure is over. You reach these
tension-laden junctions by asking hard Questions
when the time is right.

The excitement of any good story lies in
the tension, and a role-playing adventure is no
different. The best way to build tension in a
solo or GM-less adventure is by asking conflictoriented Questions. Such Questions may be
difficult to ask—the answer might put your
Character in peril or lead your adventure into
a whole new direction—but embracing those
difficult Questions makes for a more exciting
experience. Some of the best moments in a

Bering The Magnificent’s adventure has taken
an odd twist with the arrival of the NPC from
the future. The Traveler is a warrior who says
that in twenty years a legendary dragon will be
unleashed that will destroy the world. Bering
decides to help the stranger avert this dark future
by ensuring the dragon remains trapped inside its
volcanic prison.
The key to their quest is a mystical amulet with
the power to unlock the gateway into the volcano,
a passage that was sealed by the gods an age ago.
A doomsday cult is also seeking the amulet, with
the goal of freeing the dragon and unleashing
its chaos upon the world. The Traveler wants to
find the amulet before they do and destroy it.
Their eventful journey includes the search for
a lost map that reveals the amulet’s location,
exploring ancient catacombs to uncover clues,
run-ins with cult members, and a king who
wants the amulet for himself to control the
dragon for his own ambitions. Bering and the
Traveler agree to team up with the king’s spy,
and they all work together to survive the dangers
of a trap-infested dungeon while cultists hunt
them down.
After helping each other through many deadly
perils, they finally reach the central chamber
where the amulet is located. No sooner do they
enter the room than the stone slab door begins
to slide shut, and molten lava seeps in from
vents near the ceiling. The spy uses a piece of
timber to block the door from sealing them
inside, narrowing averting their fiery fate.

82

SCENES

Just when they think they’re safe, undead
skeletons crawl up from crypts in the chamber.
While Bering and the Traveler fight them off,
the spy takes the opportunity to seize the amulet
from the central altar.

NARRATIVE-KILLING QUESTIONS
Hard Questions build tension in your adventure,
but narrative-killing Questions block it. How can
you tell the difference?

The Scene culminates in Bering and his
companion defeating the undead just as the spy
makes his way to the door, amulet in hand. The
spy could easily betray them in this moment. All
he’ d have to do is kick the timber out of the way
and let the door close on his companions. Then
he could bring the artifact to his king and receive
a handsome reward.

You may be nervous to ask a tension-building
Question because it might steer your adventure
into very different territory, but this kind of
tension is exciting because it involves the
unknown. Narrative-killing Questions, however,
stop the story in its tracks. The plot doesn’t
continue into the unknown—it just ends. All
storylines conclude at some point but ending one
too soon robs you of the chance to reach a more
satisfying resolution.

Up to this point the spy has been a trustworthy
ally. They’ve all worked together against their
common enemy, the cultists. But the Player
knows that the spy has his own mission to
accomplish. The question now is, will the spy
choose his king over his companions?

One way to tell whether your Question builds
on the narrative or kills it is whether you’re
interested in the outcome. Does the answer to
the Question interest you, or are you only asking
it because you feel like you have to?

Narratively, it would be easier to assume that the
spy will wait for Bering and the Traveler—after
all, he’s been helpful so far. But after an honest
look at the Context, the Player has to admit that
the spy’s motivations have always been suspect.
This alliance is one of convenience, and if there
were ever a moment he’ d throw the others under
the bus this would be it.

For instance, when Bering and his companions
entered the room, the Player asked the Fate
Question “Does the door slide shut?” That’s a
good, tension building Question, and it makes
sense to ask given how many traps they’ve
encountered in the dungeon. The Player expects
this room to be trapped, too, and the possibility
of the door closing seems logical and interesting.
Alternatively, the Player could have asked, “Does
the door slide shut, crushing the spy to death?”
That Question could kill off the spy just like that
and end an entire storyline with no real payoff.

“Does the spy betray Bering?” is a difficult
Question to ask because it fundamentally changes
the story. If the answer is Yes, then Bering has
lost both the amulet and a valuable ally and
is now stuck in a death trap. Bering can likely
use his magic to escape the room, but from then
on he’ d have to consider the spy and his king
as much of an enemy as the cult, which would
make his quest even more of a challenge.

Between those two Questions, the Player
probably finds the first more interesting than the
second, not to mention more plausible from an
expectations point of view.
Focusing on tension-building Questions that draw
your interest will keep you from asking Questions
that send your adventure off a cliff.

You can imagine how genuinely nervous the
Player feels as they roll the dice to learn the
outcome. It’s a Question filled with tension—
which is exactly what we want.

DISCOVERING
MEANING

A LITERAL PROBLEM
When you trust yourself and listen to your
instincts, Mythic’s prompts can be a magic carpet
ride to unlimited possibilities. But if you view the
prompt too literally, they can hold you back instead
of propelling you forward.

Mythic’s Meaning Tables aren’t just good for
adding important Context to Random Events,
they can also be used to add detail to your
adventure world without asking a Fate Question.
You can roll on a Meaning Table any time you
want to know something a Yes/No Fate Question
doesn’t easily cover: determining Character
backgrounds, learning what a new NPC looks like,
discovering what action is happening in a Scene …
any detail you like. This is especially useful when
you don’t have any concrete expectations.

For example, let’s say your spacefaring Character
picks up a distress beacon from a nearby planet
on their ship’s scanners, so they decide to
land on the planet and explore it in search of
the beacon’s source. As you’re playing out the
Scene you get a Random Event with a Focus of
NPC Action that invokes a mercenary Character.
Rolling on the Meaning Tables gives you “Disrupt”
and “Location”.

The Core Meaning Tables

Taken literally these words may be hard to
interpret. But if you move beyond their literal
meaning, a distress beacon could be seen as
a marker for a location. Maybe the mercenary
tells you the beacon isn’t really from a stranded
ship, but from pirates trying to lure people in to
raid them! In this interpretation, the mercenary
“disrupts” what you thought the “location” was by
informing you it’s actually something else.

The “Random Events” chapter introduces
the core Meaning Tables: Actions, Descriptions,
Locations Elements, Characters Elements, and
Objects Elements. These five tables should cover
just about anything that might come up in your
adventure.
In our earlier example, pirate captain Edward
discovered a cavern full of wondrous treasure. As
he digs through the find with his crew he comes
across a closed chest.

the Objects Table could focus on a specific,
noteworthy item in the chest.

The Player wants to know what’s inside the
chest. They could go with their expectations
and say it’s the same as everything else in the
hoard—gold, jewels, and art—but they want to
add more detail to this treasure haul Scene, and
getting specific about the contents of the chest is a
good way to do it.

After thinking it over the Player decides to go
with the Objects Table to represent the one thing
in the chest that stands out the most.
Rolling twice on the Object Elements Meaning
Table gets them “Natural” and “Moving” —
definitely not what the Player expected! They
come up with this interpretation: Edward opens
the chest, eager to see what new delight is inside,
and falls back in surprise when dozens of live
crabs spill out. The chest is full of them! He
quickly stands and brushes himself off, reminding
himself that the treasure’s been here for a very
long time—apparently long enough to collect
crustaceous stowaways.

Since the Player wants to be surprised
Discovering Meaning seems like a better option
than coming up with a Fate Question. Out of
the five core Meaning Tables they narrow it
down to two options: Descriptions and Objects.
In this Context the Descriptions Tables could
describe the general contents of the chest, while

Getting More Specific

GET ROLLING!

The “Random Events” chapter offers five core
Elements Meaning Tables, but there are even
more than that. You’ll find 45 Elements Tables on
the following pages, each themed to something
specific. There are tables for describing dungeons,
forests, spell effects, and more. There’s also a whole
suite of Character-oriented tables for determining
what an NPC looks like, what they’re doing, their
motivations, their background, etc.
These specialized Elements Tables offer you
another degree of granularity for when you want
it. There’s no wrong choice when picking which
table to use. The main Actions and Descriptions
Tables are general enough that they can be
applied to anything; the core Elements Tables get
a little more specific when it comes to Locations,
Characters, and Objects; and the extra Elements
Tables take it a step further by getting even more
specific about certain subjects.

With so many Elements Meaning Tables to
choose from you may find yourself unable to
pick or wanting to roll on more than one. I say
do it! The purpose of the Meaning Tables is in
the name: they’re meant to add meaning to your
adventure. There’s no reason why you can’t roll
on as many tables as you want, as many times as
you want, until you have enough input to make a
solid interpretation.
Say you encounter a new NPC while exploring
a burnt-out building in a post-apocalypse
adventure. A Fate Question tells you this is a
hostile encounter; now you need to determine
who they are and what they’re doing.
You could roll on any or all of the following
Elements Tables: Character Appearance to
get an idea of what they look like, Character
Descriptors to add more detail to that
description, Character Identity to determine
what kind of NPC they are, Character Actions,
Combat to see what hostile action they take,
and Character Conversations when your
Character tries to talk with them to find out why
they’re attacking.

After loading up his ship with loot, Edward
explores the Cove of Sorrows and encounters
a new NPC. The Player wants to generate a
description for this Character using Meaning
Tables. They could use the most general tables,
Descriptions Meaning Tables; or they could get
more specific and use the Characters Elements
Meaning Table; or they could get even more
specific and use the Character Descriptors
Elements Meaning Table. Any of these tables
would give good, useful results to the Player—all
they have to do is pick one and run with it.

If you chose to roll on all of them you might get
something like this: (Dirty/Official) The attacker
is wearing a weathered Northern Army uniform.
(Colorful/Strange) His skin is a bright purple color;
presumably he’s been mutated by the Quantum
Bombs that destroyed the city. (Leader/Law) You
can tell by the insignia on his uniform that he
is a high-ranking administrator in the Northern
Army—a non-combat position. (Ambush/
Frightening) He was hiding behind a pile of rubble
until you entered the building, when he wildly
opened fire on you. (Assist/Mistrust) As you
duck behind cover you ask why he’s shooting at a
fellow Northern soldier; he says he doesn’t trust
the army anymore and that everyone is out for
themselves now.

Some Additional Thoughts
Most of the Elements Meaning Tables are selfexplanatory—for instance, the Creature Descriptors
table can be used for describing creatures, and the
Animal Actions Table for defining what an animal
does. To help you choose which ones to use, below
are descriptions of the various tables.

TABLES AT A GLANCE

The three default Elements Meaning Tables—
Locations, Characters, and Objects—are repeated
on the following pages to keep the Elements
Meaning Tables all in one place for easy reference.
You can also find a collection of all the Meaning
Tables, including Actions and Descriptions,
grouped together at the back of this book.

ADVENTURE TONE
& PLOT TWISTS
If you’re constructing an adventure in advance
and want some help from Mythic you can use the
Adventure Tone Elements Table to guide you.
You’re constructing a fantasy adventure and
want to determine the overall tone. A few rolls
on the Adventure Tone Elements Table give us
“Bizarre” and “Reassuring”. You may interpret
this to mean that this is a high-magic adventure
world with lots of fantastical creatures and
spell-craft as a part of everyday life. Despite these
extraordinary elements, the adventure world is
a stable one for your Character who fits right in
with all the strangeness.
The Plot Twists Elements Table can be used
to modify your results from the Adventure Tone
Table or as your Meaning Table for a Random
Event that you think will change the course of
your narrative.

ALIEN SPECIES DESCRIPTORS
This is meant for sci-fi adventures that feature
aliens on distant worlds. The table is biased
toward intelligent species, the kind found in a
functioning civilization.

ANIMAL ACTIONS
This table focuses on actions a wild animal
might take. This is useful for describing the
behavior of animals or any other creature that’s
feral, out of its mind, or extremely confused.

This table will give you the characteristics of
an army. It’s applicable to any large military force,
independent of genre.

The following is a list of all the Elements
Tables for describing locations:
» THE CAVERN TABLE is good for
natural, enclosed spaces such as cave systems.

details of a living space, such as the outside
of a house or the inside of a bedroom.
» THE DUNGEON TABLE gives the kind
of atmospheric descriptions one would
expect from a classic dungeon crawl.
» THE FOREST TABLE is good for thick
jungles or woods full of forbidding trees.
» THE LOCATIONS TABLE is the most
generic of the bunch, useful for defining
any location.
» THE STARSHIP TABLE can be used
for any sci-fi structure, from the inside
of a spaceship to the hallways of an
underground moon base.
» THE TERRAIN TABLE describes the
topographical details of an area of land or an
entire world viewed from orbit.

CHARACTERS
Tables describing Characters are the most
numerous category of Elements Meaning Tables,
making up 12 of the total 45. You can use these
tables to build entire Characters from the ground
up—including your own Player Character!—or
to generate important details about NPCs as you
encounter them.

102

THE CHARACTERS TABLE is the most
generic of the Characters Elements Tables,
meant to cover anything Character-related.
THE CHARACTER ACTIONS,
COMBAT TABLE suggests actions an
NPC might take in a battle.
THE CHARACTER ACTIONS,
GENERAL TABLE covers any kind of
action an NPC might take.
THE CHARACTER APPEARANCE
TABLE offers inspiration for what an
NPC looks like.
THE CHARACTER BACKGROUND
TABLE is for a Character’s history.
THE CHARACTER
CONVERSATIONS TABLE is useful
when figuring out what a Character is
saying.
THE CHARACTER DESCRIPTORS
TABLE gives more general descriptors about
a Character’s life, appearance, or personality.
THE CHARACTER IDENTITY
TABLE is meant to help determine what
the Character’s role or occupation is.
THE CHARACTER MOTIVATIONS
TABLE reveals why a Character does what
they do.
THE CHARACTER PERSONALITY
TABLE focuses on the Character’s
demeanor and temperament.

SCENES

»

THE CHARACTER SKILLS TABLE
tells you what talents a Character has.
» THE CHARACTER TRAITS &
FLAWS TABLE is similar to Character
Personality but focuses more on things that
help or hinder the Character.
Using several of these tables together can help
you quickly flesh out an NPC.

DOUBLE DUTY
While the Elements Meaning Tables are more
specific than the Actions and Descriptions
Meaning Tables, they’re still vague enough to
allow for a wide range of possibilities. This makes
it simple to apply an Elements Table to situations
it may not seem intended for.

The Player Character in an espionage adventure
needs to meet with a new NPC, Nate Calhoun,
to acquire a fake passport and identity papers. In
this Scene the PC is introduced to Calhoun late
at night on a street in San Francisco.

You could use the Powers Table to describe
the abilities of a superhero or to determine
what a piece of alien technology does. Animal
Actions seems appropriate for a wolf in the wild,
but it could also help you determine what a
malfunctioning robot does. If an NPC is telling you
shocking news that changes the narrative, you
could roll on the Character Conversations Table
or on the Plot Twists Table.

The Player knows nothing about Calhoun
other than that he is a known source of fake
identification, servicing both government spies
and the criminal underworld. They want to start
off the encounter with a physical description of
Calhoun, so they roll on the Character Appearance
Elements Table, getting “Frail” and “Aromatic”.
The Player interprets this to mean that Calhoun is
a very thin man smoking a cigarette.

While the Elements Tables aren’t as broad as the
core Actions and Descriptions Tables, they can
still be applied to more than one thing.

established the look and personality of Nate
Calhoun. These facts build Context around this
NPC, making it easier to figure out what he does
for the rest of the Scene.

As the PC engages Calhoun in conversation, the
Player rolls on the Character Personality Table
to get an idea of what kind of person Calhoun
is. They roll “Interesting” and “Perceptive”.
The Player’s interpretation is that Calhoun
listens closely to what the PC says, asking a
few questions along the way and dropping an
interesting statement in the process.

CIVILIZATION DESCRIPTORS
This table is meant to conceptualize the broad
strokes of an entire civilization, such as their average
technology level or predominant social attitudes.

To figure out what interesting thing Calhoun
says, the Player rolls on the Character
Conversations Table and gets “Classy” and
“Innocent”. The Player’s interpretation is that
Calhoun plays it cool during the conversation,
not wanting to know anything more than he
needs to for both their sakes. “I heard what I
need, but I didn’t hear anything else. Who you’re
working for is your business—just yours.”

CREATURE DESCRIPTORS,
CREATURE ABILITIES, &
UNDEAD DESCRIPTORS
These tables are useful for generating strange,
fantastical creatures or monsters and assigning
them powers and abilities. The Creature
Descriptors Table is designed for any kind of
creature, while The Undead Descriptors Table is
more targeted to zombies and the like.

With these rolls on the Character-oriented
Elements Meaning Tables, the Player quickly

CRYPTIC MESSAGE

GODS

This table is perfect for when you need a
foreboding message that says something without
saying much at all, with words that focus on
communication, conflict, and obscurity.

This table focuses on generating aspects of a god
that might be worshiped by a fantasy culture or
alien race. It’s not meant for the gods themselves
as individuals, but more for what they represent—
their domains, in other words.

CURSES
This table is meant for magical curses, with
words that focus on misfortunes.

DUNGEON TRAPS
Everyone loves a good dungeon trap. The
words on this table are meant to suggest how a
trap functions once it’s sprung.

LEGENDS
This table, meant to inspire ancient legends,
lends itself to multiple rolls building layers of
story around the tales of long ago.

MAGICAL ITEM DESCRIPTORS
This table is meant to suggest what a magical
item looks like and does.

MEANING WORD CONNECTORS
Word pairs generated from the Meaning Tables
are meant to be thought of together to inspire an
interpretation. But what do you do if the words you
get aren’t inspiring you?
The PC triggers a magical trap while exploring the
ruins of an ancient temple. Their Player determines
through Fate Questions that they stepped on a glyph
inscribed on the floor that triggers a spell. To figure
out what the activated spell does, the Player rolls on
the Spell Effects Elements Table for inspiration, getting
“Strength” and “Environment”. They aren’t sure how to
interpret these two words together in this Context.
When you’re stuck for an interpretation you can
change the relationship between the two words by
inserting a connector word that turns them into a
short phrase. This slight change in meaning may
inspire an interpretation. For instance:
Of: Inserting “of” between Meaning words combines
them by having the first word highlight an aspect of
the second word. In this case it gives us “Strength of
Environment”, suggesting that the environment itself
is strong. The Player could interpret this to mean that

the entrance to the ruined temple is suddenly and
magically sealed up.
-ly: Adding “ly” to the end of the first word turns it
into a crude adverb that modifies the second word.
Using it here gives us “Strengthly Environment”. The
Player could interpret this to mean that the glyph
isn’t a trap; it’s a boon that makes the PC super
strong while they’re inside the temple.
And: Placing “and” between the words separates
them into two different, unconnected concepts. In
this case we get “Strength and Environment”. The
Player could interpret this to mean the Character gets
stronger and is also teleported to a new environment.
But: Adding “but” is the opposite of “and”: the first
word is diminished by the second word. In this case
we get “Strength but Environment”. The Player might
interpret this to mean that the building suddenly
loses strength and begins to collapse.
Adding a connector between Meaning words is
a useful technique if a good interpretation isn’t
springing to mind. After you’ve tried a few different
options one interpretation will likely stand out.

104

SCENES

MUTATION DESCRIPTORS

Names for people, places, and things can run
a very wide gamut. The Names Table is meant to
narrow down the possible selections and inspire
a certain sound for the generated name, lending
itself to loose interpretation. Rather than rolling
twice you may want to keep rolling until you get a
sound that comes across as a valid name to you.

This table is similar to Powers, with some
subtle differences that take into account the
mixed nature of abilities derived from mutations.
There’s more emphasis on the subject’s body, and
some results imply that a mutation is detrimental.

The Player Character, a starship captain, is
approaching a new planet that their Player
wants a name for. Rolling on the Names
Elements Table they get “Tal” and “El”. That
doesn’t sound quite right to them yet so the Player
rolls a third time and gets “Action”. This inspires
the name Tallelrun.

NAMES
This table requires a bit more explanation than
the others. It’s a collection of sounds and concepts
that, when combined, are suggestive of names.
Most of the entries are meant to be sounded out
rather than used literally.
The Player is coming up with the name of a
fantasy warrior. They roll “Hee” and “R”. After
sounding these out, they might create names such
as Hir, Huir, or Heer.

After discovering an advanced civilization on
the planet the PC arranges a meeting with their
leader. To generate his name the Player rolls
“Len”, “In”, “Pr”, “Tar”. This inspires the name
Lennin Pertar.

Concepts such as “Number” or “Emotion” are
meant to evoke a word related to those concepts
that you can slot into the name.

NOBLE HOUSE
For creating the general characteristics of a
noble or royal household. It can be thought of as
generating the current state of the Noble House,
or its history.

Generating the name for a town, the Player rolls
“In” and “Elements”. They might come up with
names like Innsea, Inice, or Inflam.

Bern is ready for another day of searching for supplies, the Player making heavy use of the Scavenging Results Elements Meaning Table. Just another day
in the apocalypse.

GENERATING
NPC BEHAVIOR

OBJECTS
There are several other tables for describing
specific kinds of items but the Objects Table is
general enough that it can be applied to anything.
It works best for when you don’t know what an
object is and want prompts to figure it out.

The PC has battled his way through the Canyons
of Chron, slaying beast after beast on an alien
world to prove his worth to a powerful warlord.
He returns triumphant to the warband’s
encampment and is summoned to the warlord’s
tent. The warlord, flanked by guards, leans
forward in his chair and says … .

POWERS
This Elements Meaning Table is meant to
inspire powers of all sorts, from heroic superpowers
to the strange abilities of an alien creature.

SCAVENGING RESULTS
Designed for post-apocalyptic settings, or any
other site of desolation you’re picking through
for goods, this table tells you what type of items
you’ve uncovered and if the act of scavenging has
put you in danger.

SMELLS & SOUNDS
These two tables are good for generating sensory
information. They can be applied to any situation
where a Character is testing the air or listening.

What does he say? Where do we go from here?
You figure out what an NPC does in your
adventure the same way you figure out anything
else in Mythic: with expectations, Fate Questions,
and Meaning Tables.
In the example above, if the Player
had a clear expectation for
what the warlord would say,
they might go with that. “The
warlord says he’s impressed
with your performance.”
If they have some idea but

SPELL EFFECTS
This table helps you determine what kind of
spell is being cast—useful when facing an enemy
sorcerer or after springing a magical trap with
a spell-like effect. The results are generalized,
intended to give you a rough category of spell.

VISIONS & DREAMS
Similar to Cryptic Messages, Visions &
Dreams focus on potential future conflict with
words about warnings and solutions.

STRATEGY FOR GENERATING
NPC ACTIONS

aren’t sure, they might frame it as a Fate Question
such as, “Does the warlord say he’s impressed?” If
they had no idea what the warlord would say, they
might roll on a Meaning Table for inspiration.
Using expectations for behavior is good for
unimportant NPCs or when you don’t want to
slow down your adventure to randomize NPC
actions. If you have an idea of what the NPC will
do, and their action is important to the adventure,
you could pose the expected action as a Fate
Question. This adds some randomness to the
NPC’s action—you think you know what they’ll
do but they might do something else.
If you have no idea what the NPC will do then
you can roll a completely random action on a
Meaning Table. The most useful Meaning Tables
for determining NPC actions are:
» Actions
» Characters (Elements)
» Animal Actions (Elements)
» Character Actions, Combat (Elements)
» Character Actions, General (Elements)
» Character Conversations (Elements)

Expectations As Actions
Most NPC actions will be determined by your
expectations; you’re probably not going to roll
for every single thing an NPC does. If Bering
the Magnificent is walking through a village
market, then his Player will probably assume that
the NPCs around him are going about their own
business. When you have a clear expectation for
an NPC action, and the action isn’t important
to the course of your adventure, then simply
following your expectations will do.

Discovering Meaning As Actions

A warrior PC sits down in a tavern, intent on
getting something to eat and questioning the
barkeeper for news about the area.

Maybe the Player has no idea what the NPC
will do or they want to randomize it. Instead of
following their expectations they can use words
from Meaning Tables.

The barkeeper is a new NPC, but the Player
decides their initial action in this encounter is
obvious: they come over to the PC’s table and say,
“What can I get you?”

The warrior’s Player changes their mind and
decides to determine the tavern keeper’s action
using Meaning Tables. Rolling on the Characters

107

SCENES

Elements Table gets them “Odd” and “Passive.”
They interpret this to mean that the barkeeper
shambles over to the PC and grunts at them,
apparently his way of asking the PC what they
would like.

KEEP IT LOOSE AND FLOWING
You can check for NPC actions as often or as
rarely as you like. Maybe you choose to only
determine an NPC’s first action in an encounter
and follow your expectations from there, or
maybe you’re in a tense confrontation with an
important NPC and want to randomly determine
the Character’s actions round-by-round.

Fate Questions As Actions
If you have an expectation for the NPC’s
behavior that you’d like to test you could ask a
Fate Question. This is a good choice if the NPC’s
actions are important to your adventure or you
just want to randomize the behavior.

If you’re frequently asking Fate Questions or
consulting Meaning Tables to determine NPC
behavior it’s important to keep your adventure
moving smoothly by taking the broadest
interpretations you can. This will help you not get
held up on a difficult Interpretation.

The Player decides to test their expectation with a
Fate Question. They ask, “Does the barkeeper come
to take my order?” assigning Odds of Certain.
When determining NPC actions with Fate
Questions choose a behavior the NPC is likely to
do. You don’t have to be sure about this choice since
you’re going to test it with a Fate Question anyway.
If you’re in the middle of an encounter where
the NPC has already taken action you could ask,
“Does the NPC keep doing what they’re doing?”
This is especially useful in tense situations where
an NPC’s actions matter every round but you
don’t want to slow down to think about what
they’ll do each time. Instead, you simply check to
see if they continue a previous action.
Bering the Magnificent is facing off against an
assassin on the deck of a ship during a rough
storm. The Player has a good idea of what the
assassin will do, so they ask the Fate Question,
“Does the assassin attack Bering with his sword?”
with Odds of Nearly Certain. Mythic says Yes,
and the battle begins.
In the next round, the Player wants to see if the
assassin continues fighting in this way, so they
ask, “Does the assassin continue with his current
action?” with Odds of Certain.
Phrase the action as a Fate Question and
assign it Odds like you would with any other Fate

Question. If it’s a behavior you expect it’s probable
that your Odds will at least be Likely if not
stronger. If you’re unsure then consider the Odds
50/50. If you’re really unsure and just taking a
shot in the dark with a random behavior you
might go with lesser Odds such as Unlikely.
You can resolve these Fate Questions using
Mythic’s normal rules or you can consult the
NPC Behavior Table for suggestions on how to
handle NPC actions.

NPC BEHAVIOR TABLE
The NPC Behavior Table offers suggestions for
how to interpret Fate Questions about NPC actions.
A Yes answer to a behavior Fate Question is easy
to interpret: the NPC either does what you thought
they would do or continues to do what they were
already doing.
A No answer means the NPC does something
other than what you expected. If you have an idea
of what that would be you can use that as the
action; otherwise, choose a Meaning Table to roll
on for inspiration.
An Exceptional Yes means the NPC does what’s
expected with greater intensity.

108

SCENES

The Player asks the Fate Question “Does the
assassin continue with his current action?” Mythic
answers with an Exceptional Yes. The Player’s
interpretation is that the NPC launches himself at
Bering in an aggressive attack without taking any
defensive precautions.

NPC BEHAVIOR TABLE
FATE
QUESTION
RESULT

An Exceptional No means the NPC either does
the opposite of what you expected or does the
next most expected action with greater intensity.
If you don’t have any ideas for an expected
behavior roll on a Meaning Table for inspiration
and make the resulting action more intense.
A few rounds later Mythic answers Exceptional
No to “Does the assassin continue his current
action?” The fight hasn’t been going well for the
assassin, with Bering using magic to fend him
off. The Player decides that the opposite of what
they expected would be for the assassin to break
away from the fight and flee.
If the Fate Question about NPC behavior
generates a Random Event consider the Event
an additional part of the NPC’s actions, with
Current Context as the Event Focus and the
nature of the action determined by rolling on
a Meaning Table. Combine the result with the
original action if it makes sense; otherwise, treat
them as two separate actions, basing the first
action on the result of your Fate Question and the
second action on the result of the Random Event.

YES

The NPC does what you
expect or continues with
their ongoing action.

NO

The NPC does the next
most expected behavior.
If you’re unsure what that
is then roll on a Meaning
Table for inspiration.

EXCEPTIONAL
YES

The NPC does the expected
action, or continues
their ongoing action,
with greater intensity.

EXCEPTIONAL
NO

The NPC does the opposite
of what you expected or
does the next most expected
behavior with greater
intensity. If you’re unsure
then roll on a Meaning
Table for inspiration and
intensify that action.

RANDOM
EVENT

When Bering’s Player rolled Exceptional No for
the assassin’s action they also rolled a Random
Event. The Player rolls on the “Character
Actions, Combat” Elements Table and gets
“Charge” and “Lie”.

“DOES THE NPC DO X?”

Roll on a Meaning
Table for an additional
action from the NPC.

leaps over the ship’s railing. The charge attack
was a bluff to make Bering hunker down and
give the assassin an opportunity to escape.

The Player decides it makes sense to combine the
Random Event with the Fate Question’s answer
of Exceptional No; the Event will help clarify the
NPC’s unexpected action. They interpret it this
way: the assassin charges at Bering again with
a wild battle cry. Bering braces himself for the
impact, his mystic barriers up. But just before he
reaches Bering, the assassin veers to the side and

Conversations
Saying something is an action, too. When
determining what an NPC says in a conversation
it’s helpful to focus on the overall tone and
message the NPC is trying to convey. Like

109

SCENES

anything in a Mythic adventure, the rules
presented here are meant to give you general
guidance; the actual words the NPC uses are up to
you. Feel free to use creative license as long as their
dialog is in line with the result you generated.
Nemenor, a knight PC, has joined forces with
the dragon Gregroth to work against a mutual
foe. They’re currently traveling together through
a forest. As evening draws near the knight asks
the dragon where he thinks they should camp for
the night.

Social Skills
If you’re using Mythic with an RPG that has
social skills you can incorporate skill rolls into
your interactions with NPCs. The results of these
skill rolls become part of the Context, helping
you formulate expectations, adjust the Odds
of Fate Questions, and interpret the roll results
(including any Meaning Table rolls) to interpret
NPC behavior.

The Player frames the expected action as a Fate
Question: “Does Gregroth suggest camping next
to a pile of boulders?” They don’t really know
what the dragon will say but this response seems
plausible, so they give the Question Odds of
50/50. Mythic returns a Yes.
Later, after they make camp, Nemenor asks
the dragon who should take first watch during
the night. The Player asks, “Does Gregroth say
he will take first watch?” assigning this Odds
of 50/50. Mythic comes back with a No. The
Player interprets this to mean the dragon says the
knight should take first watch since that seems
like the next most expected thing he would say.
If specific language is required (maybe you’re
playing in a group setting and want to give the
interaction more color, or maybe you’re writing out
your solo session for a blog post or your personal
journal), then the Player can use any words that
make sense with the rolled results.
The Player words the first exchange between
knight and dragon like this: Nemenor glances at
the sky, noting that they have about an hour left
until dark. “We should start looking for shelter
before nightfall.” He turns to the dragon. “Do
you have a preferred way to camp in the woods?”
Gregroth glances around at their surroundings.
“Rocks. I like rocks. Big rocks. Let’s find a nice
pile of boulders to curl up against, get all warm
and cozy.”

From combat to conversations you can determine NPC actions
by using a combination of expectations, Fate Questions, and
Discovering Meaning.

SCENES

END OF SCENE
BOOKKEEPING

GETTING TO KNOW YOU
The more interactions you have with an NPC
during an adventure the more you’ll come to
understand them. Over time you’ll get a feel for
what a Character would do or say in any situation,
making it easier to determine actions and
conversations as you go.

It’s your call when to end a Scene (as discussed
in the “Scene Structure” section on page 63),
but usually a Scene ends when the primary action
in that Scene wraps up. Before you move on to
the next Scene you have a few Bookkeeping tasks
to do.

For example, maybe your sci-fi spaceship captain
is trying to talk another ship into assisting them
with repairs, and you roll against your Character’s
Persuasion skill to get them to cooperate.
Let’s say your Character succeeds. In game
terms this means you talk the other ship into
helping you. If you wanted to use Mythic to play
out this interaction in more detail you’d approach
it with the knowledge that the other ship’s captain
will say yes, so whatever results you get from
Mythic will have to fit into that Context.
On the other hand, maybe the skill roll
indicates that your Character did a good job at
presenting their case, but it doesn’t guarantee a
specific reaction. You may decide that the skill roll
results adjust the Odds of the Fate Question, “Do
they help us with repairs?”, so that while a failed
roll would give 50/50 Odds of a Yes a successful
roll bumps that up to Very Likely.
You can also use skills to help you decide
what an expected behavior would be. Maybe
your Character succeeded exceptionally well
on their Persuasion roll, and the negotiation is
going so smoothly that you think the other ship
might not only help with repairs but also join
your Character’s quest through space. You may
use these rolls as the basis for a behavior Fate
Question like, “Does the ship captain decide to
join us?”

Add List Elements
The end of a Scene is the time to add Threads
and Characters to your Lists if they were active in
the Scene. Think about the Scene that just played
out and add any Threads or NPCs that seem
important to the adventure.
If any Threads or Characters already on a List
played a part in the Scene add an additional entry
for them as well. This creates weighted Lists that
make important elements more likely to reappear
in your adventure. Once a specific Thread or NPC
has filled three slots on its List don’t add any more
entries of that element, even if it’s important in a
later Scene.
You can consider a Thread or Character
“important” to the Scene if it was invoked by a
Random Event or something meaningful happens
in a Scene that involves the Thread or Character.

THREADS LIST
Threads are goals that your Player Character is
pursuing. You can add any Thread to the List that
you want, even if it hasn’t come up in a Scene.
Early on in the adventure, the Player Character
decides that Bering will take up a quest to return
a stolen relic treasured by a poor, remote village.
The Player adds “Return relic” as a Thread.
Later, when Bering emerges from the rat-infested
dungeon, the Player decides he needs more
healing magic. There are no potion sellers nearby

111

SCENES

END OF SCENE BOOKKEEPING

and no one around who can teach him healing
spells, so the Player adds “Acquire healing magic”
to the Threads List as a goal to pursue.
A few Scenes after deciding to acquire healing
magic, Bering is chatting with a farmer who’s
tending to a field of cows. Bering has been trailing
a group of travelers he suspects of stealing the sacred
artifact, so he asks the farmer if he’s seen anyone
lately. The farmer mentions seeing a local healer
who helped him with his livestock. Intrigued,
Bering asks for more information and realizes that
this mysterious healer may be a wizard.
This is an important potential lead for Bering to
get his hands on healing potions, which reflects
one of the Threads. At the end of the Scene the
Player writes “Acquire healing magic” for a
second time on the Threads List.

CHARACTERS LIST
You can add just about anything to the
Characters List, from individual NPCs to
organizations to geographical areas to objects. If it

CROWDING OUT THE GOOD STUFF
While adding lots of Threads that interest you
can make for an expansive adventure, there are
also good reasons for keeping your Threads List
sparse. The more Threads you have, the more
options are available for Random Events. You may
like having all that potential for plot twists, but if
the plot is centered around a single core Thread,
those extra plotlines may detract from the focus
of your adventure.
Think about the kind of experience you’re looking
for. If you want something laser-focused on
one goal, be more selective about adding new
Threads. If you’re looking for more of a sandbox
approach, add as many Threads as you like, with
the knowledge that you may sometimes take
significant detours from your primary goal.

112

SCENES

NOT WAITING TIL THE END

CLEANING UP LISTS

Editing your Lists after the Scene is over means
you don’t have to pause the action, but it’s not a
bad idea to update them as you play if it doesn’t
slow things down too much. Adding or removing
Threads and Characters during a Scene means
those elements will be available sooner for
Random Events; it also makes Bookkeeping easier
since you won’t have to think back on the Scene
to remember which Threads and Characters
stood out.

Mythic Lists can get messy over time. Threads get
added as you come across new goals, Characters
get added as they’re introduced, Threads and
Characters get additional entries when they
come into play again, Threads get removed when
they’re completed, Characters get removed when
they lose relevance … there’s a lot going on in
those 25 lines!
If you max out a List with no room for new
entries, it’s time to clean up. Get a fresh, empty
Adventure List sheet and copy over the Threads
and Characters you want to keep, with a single
entry for each element. For any Threads or
Characters with three entries on the original List,
give them two entries on the new List. Doing this
resets the Lists, decreasing elements that have
grown while still retaining weighted importance
for the most popular items.

You’ll most likely do a combination of the two,
making changes to the Lists as you play and going
over them again at the end of a Scene to make
sure you caught everything.

has some level of activity and can act for or against
your PC you can add it to the Characters List.
Bering the Magnificent has come across several
different monsters and opponents in the dungeon
he’s exploring, including giant mutated rats, robed
cultists lurking in the shadows, and demonic
frogs squatting in stygian pools. The Player has
added each of these antagonists to the Characters
List. Mutant Rats appear three times on the List
because they’ve featured in many Scenes, while
Cultists appear twice and Demon Frogs only once.

Cleaning up your Lists is a prime opportunity
to edit them in other ways as well. If you think a
Thread or Character should be removed, go ahead
and do it. Maybe a minor Character who appeared
early on in the Adventure no longer seems
relevant, or maybe there’s a Thread you forgot
about that you’re no longer interested in pursuing.
You can also consolidate less important
Characters into a single group entry to free up
more space. If you’ve met an innkeeper, a farmer,
and a merchant during your adventure, but none
of them have proven to be important, you could
combine them into a single entry called “Villagers”
on the Characters List.

After a Scene in which Bering survived a trap, the
Player decides that the dungeon itself should be on
the Characters List to represent pitfalls, cave-ins,
and other nasty surprises.

Your new, revised Lists give your adventure room
to continue evolving. If the new List gets full it’ll be
time to tidy up again.

Remove List Elements
Review your Threads and Characters Lists
and remove any elements you feel are no longer
relevant to your adventure, (accomplished goals,
defeated enemies, etc.). If the irrelevant Thread
or Character appears more than once on the List
cross out all instances of it.

Removing an NPC doesn’t necessarily mean
they’ve died. Characters can exit an adventure for
all kinds of reasons, including that you’ve deemed
them no longer important to your adventure. The
same is true for Threads: you can remove one

113

SCENES

simply because you are no longer interested in
pursuing it.

REVERT TOWARD THE MEAN

In the swashbuckling adventure with Edward the
pirate, the Player has a Thread of “Get vengeance
against the dread pirate Victor”. Then Edward
learns that he wasn’t betrayed by Victor at all but
by the governor of Capsalon Island—he’s been
pursuing the wrong villain! The Player removes
the now-irrelevant Thread from the List and
replaces it with “Bring the governor to justice.”

The default rule for the Chaos Factor is to
increase it when a Scene wasn’t under Player
Character control and decrease it when it was.
This gives the CF a snowball effect, where crisis
begets more crisis and calm begets more calm
until something happens to switch things up.
If you prefer, you can flip this concept on its head
by reverting toward the mean so that the CF
goes up when a Scene goes well for the Player
Characters and down when a Scene goes poorly.
Instead of a snowball effect, you get a release
valve—the more controlled Scenes you have in
a row the more things are likely to blow up on
the Player Characters; the more things blow up
on them, the more likely things are to calm down
again. This kind of adventure will have a slightly
different feel from the norm, with fewer extreme
mood swings as the Chaos Factor gets continually
nudged back toward the middle.

Adjust The Chaos Factor
The final Bookkeeping task is adjusting the
Chaos Factor. Think about the Scene that just
happened and decide whether you think the
Player Character(s) were in control of events—in
other words, whether the Scene was a success or a
failure for them. Did they make progress toward
any of their goals? Did they suffer any setbacks or
sidetracks?
Maybe the PC was seriously wounded while
navigating a building full of explosive traps, but
they still made it through. You might decide
that the progress your Character made is more
important than the damage they sustained, so the
Scene was more in their control than out of it.
On the other hand, maybe the PC was forced to
retreat back to where they came from, in which
case you might decide that the Scene was more
out of their control than within it.
A Scene that was mostly within your PC’s
control gives the CF a -1 modifier, lowering the
Chaos of the adventure, while a Scene that was
mostly out of their control gives the CF a +1
modifier, raising the Chaos. The CF cannot go
below 1 or above 9; any modifiers that would take
it beyond that range are ignored.
For alternative methods of adjusting the Chaos
Factor check out the sidebars “Revert Toward The
Mean” and “Random Chaos” on this page.

RANDOM CHAOS
Another way to handle the Chaos Factor is to
skip the process of evaluating how well the Player
Character(s) did in a Scene and simply let the
dice decide how the Chaos Factor changes. This
gives you one less thing to worry about in the
Bookkeeping phase.
At the end of a Scene roll a d10. If you roll equal
to the current Chaos Factor or less, give it a -1
modifier with a minimum of 1; if you roll more
than the Chaos Factor, give it a +1 modifier with
a maximum of 9. This detaches the Chaos Factor
from the PC’s actions, letting it ebb and flow at
the whim of the dice.
With this method the tone of your adventure will
shift at random intervals based on your Chaos
rolls from Scene to Scene. As with Revert Toward
The Mean, extreme values will be rare, with the CF
more frequently moving back toward the middle.

THE BIG SCENES
EXAMPLE:
GUARDIAN OF THE
CHOSEN ONE

might meet along the way and “Mountains” to
account for any dangers and resources the rugged
terrain may present.
With their Lists prepared, the Player is ready to
begin the first Scene.

Let’s put Mythic’s Scene structure through its
paces! Unlike the smaller examples in the rest of
the chapter that put everything in italics, this Big
Example will use italics to indicate the role-played
story and normal text to explain mechanics and
interpretations for maximum readability.
In this example, the Player is running a solo
adventure using Mythic with their favorite fantasy
RPG. Their Character is Lennz, a hunter and
wilderness expert who’s already been through
a few adventures, gaining experience along the
way. He was hired by a mountain village to lead
the Chosen One, a child prophesied to have great
powers, to a hilltop monastery. The route to the
monastery is through rugged terrain in an area
Lennz knows well.
The Player came up with the details of
this adventure using the Plot Twists Elements
Meaning Tables. They interpreted the word pair,
“Public” and “Require”, as a “public” village that
“required” Lennz to do the task he was hired for.
The idea of the task being a protect-and-deliver
mission for a child religious figure was just
something the Player thought would be cool.
The Player decides that the first Scene will
be about Lennz beginning the trek through the
mountains with the Chosen One. Since this is the
first Scene it doesn’t need to be tested against the
Chaos Factor to see whether it happens or not.
Since they already have an idea for the
adventure, the Player decides to add the
major details to their Lists. They add “Deliver
the Chosen One” to the Threads List and
“Chosen One”, “Villagers”, and “Mountains”
to the Characters List. They decided to include
“Villagers” on the List to account for anyone they

Deliver the Chosen One

The Chosen One
Villagers
Mountains

Because the landscape is too rough for riding
animals, Lennz and the boy are traveling on
foot. The first leg of their journey is easy because
there are paths near the village, which gives
Lennz some time to chat with the Chosen One.
It turns out the boy has a proper name: Ninfee
Wryrock. He says he wasn’t born in the village
but was found by a farmer and brought there;
he doesn’t know anything about his own heritage
or history. There’s a strange mark on his arm,
which is apparently what identified him as the
Chosen One, though he doesn’t know much
about the prophecy he’s meant to fulfill.
Most of the details in this Scene were generated
by the Player asking Fate Questions. “Can we
use horses?” No. “Is the terrain near the village
rough?” Exceptional No.
The Player thought it would make sense for
Lennz and the boy to talk during this first part
of the journey. Since the Player had no idea what
the boy might say, they rolled on the Character
Conversations Elements Meaning Table for
inspiration and got “Careless” and “Mysterious”.
The Player interpreted this to mean that the
boy is very trusting, answering all of Lennz’s
questions, but that the Chosen One seemed to
know little about his own past.

115

SCENES

The Player also figured Lennz would ask if
the Chosen One had a proper name. They made
the possibility of a name into a Fate Question
and got Yes. To determine the boy’s name, the
Player rolled on the Names Elements Meaning
Table and got “Nn” and “Fi”. Wanting more to
work with, they rolled some more and got “Wr”
and “Nature”. The Player interpreted this as
Ninfee Wryrock.
This first Scene was simple, establishing what
the adventure will be about. The Player decides
to end the Scene after Lennz and Ninfee spend
the day walking and chatting. Since Lennz was
in control during this Scene, the Player gives -1
to the Chaos Factor, lowering it from the starting
value of 5 to 4.
The Player records the major details on their
Adventure Journal sheet as part of their end-ofScene Bookkeeping. Then they look over their Lists
to see if anything needs to be added or removed.

The Player prepares for the next Scene by
coming up with an Expected Scene. They decide it
would make sense for Lennz and Ninfee to make
camp at nightfall and set out again the next day,
this time encountering more treacherous terrain.
The Player tests this Expected Scene against
the Chaos Factor by rolling a d10. They roll 8,
exceeding the current Chaos Factor of 4, so the
Expected Scene happens as envisioned.
The next morning, Lennz and Ninfee break
camp and set out again. The farther they get
from the village, the rougher the terrain becomes
as well-trod dirt roads give way to unsullied
rocky ground. They climb many steep hillsides,
with Lennz helping Ninfee when he struggles.
Suddenly, Lennz spots a small warband of orcs
on the other side of the valley, and he pulls Ninfee
behind a boulder to hide before they’re spotted.
This is bad. Lennz is going to have to be very
careful from here on out to avoid contact with
the orcs. He has no idea if they’re aware of the
prophecy, but if they are, they may see Ninfee as
a very valuable hostage.

Prominent elements in this first Scene included
“The Chosen One”, the “Mountains”, and the
Thread of “Deliver the Chosen One”. Since these
elements are already on the Lists, the Player adds
an additional entry for each. No new Characters
or Threads presented themselves in this Scene.

The two of them move cautiously for the rest of
the day, with Lennz keeping an eye out for orcs.
With the way forward getting more difficult,
the Player began this Scene by asking Fate
Questions about the terrain. “Do we run into any
difficult terrain today?” Yes. “Does Ninfee have
difficulty?” Yes.
A little later, a Fate Question generated a
Random Event. Rolling on the Event Focus Table,
the Player got “Move Away From A Thread”.
Since there’s only one Thread on the List there
was no need to roll for it.
The Player rolled on the Actions Meaning
Tables for inspiration and got “Block” and
“Project”. They had an idea of what this could
mean but weren’t sure about it, so they posed
it as a Fate Question: “Do we encounter orcs?”
Yes. The Player interpreted this to mean that
they unexpectedly came across a warband of orcs
116

SCENES

making their way through the mountains, posing
a danger that will hamper their progress.
For the rest of the Scene, as Lennz and Ninfee
make their careful way forward, the Player asks
a Fate Questions from time to time to see if they
run into orcs, but nothing else happens. The Player
decides this is a good place to end the Scene.
For end-of-Scene Bookkeeping, the Player
updates the Adventure Journal with a summary
of Scene 2’s events. Then they think about the
Chaos Factor—was Lennz in control because he
spotted the warband and evaded them, or was he
not in control because they had to change their
course to avoid trouble? The Player decides that
the introduction of the orcs and Lennz having to
change travel tactics was more out of control than
in control, so they raise the Chaos Factor by 1
point, bringing it back to 5.
Now to adjust the Lists. The Player adds
“Avoid the orcs” as a Thread and “Orc warband”
as a Character. They also repeat “Deliver the
Chosen One” on the Threads List and the “The
Chosen One” on the Characters List since those
elements were relevant this Scene. Both of these
elements now appear three times on their Lists, so
The Player won’t add any more entries of them in
future Scenes.

Deliver the Chosen One

Now for the next Expected Scene. The Player
assumes that Lennz was given some information
about the region and knows of another village
nearby, so their Expected Scene is that the two of
them will head toward this village in search of help.
The Player rolls a d10 to test this Expected Scene
and gets a 3. This is an odd number within the
Chaos Factor range of 5, which means we get an
Altered Scene instead of the Expected Scene. The
Player figures that the next most Expected thing to
happen would be running into the orc warband.
Starting Scene 3, the Player asks the Fate
Question “Do we encounter the orcs the next day?”
Mythic says No. The Player interprets this to mean
the encounter happens that night while they’re
making camp.
“Do the orcs surprise attack us?” Yes.
Lennz and Ninfee spend a tense day staying
out of sight and camp down for the night in a
valley to avoid being seen. Lennz decides they
can rest for now and set out for the nearby
village in the morning.

As they prepare to sleep, Lennz hears a twig snap
in the brush. His keen survival senses have him
reaching for his sword just as three orcs rush into
their camp, and he takes them all on in a fast and
furious fight. The orcs are surprised by how capable
he is in combat—this is no hillside farmer.

While Lennz battles two of the orcs, the third
one makes a run at Ninfee. Lennz cries out for
the boy to run, but Ninfee stands his ground.

117

SCENES

There’s a sudden burst of light from the boy, an
outflowing of power, and the orc is thrown back
by the force of the blast.
Surprised and afraid, the orcs retreat back into
the night. Lennz looks at Ninfee, shocked by
the sudden display of power. Ninfee looks just
as surprised.
The Player used the skills and combat rules from
their chosen RPG to play out this Scene. Lennz
rolled well enough to notice the approach of the
orcs and be ready when they pounced.
To guide the combat, the Player started by
asking “Do the orcs focus on Lennz?” This
seemed reasonable since Lennz would be the
biggest threat to take down. Mythic said Yes.
This three-on-one combat continued for several
rounds. Using the NPC Behavior Table each
round, the Player asked the Fate Question, “Do
the orcs continue with their current action?” The
answer each round was Yes, meaning the orcs
continued to fight with Lennz.
On the fourth round, however, the answer was
No. The Player’s interpretation was that one of the
orcs broke off from the fight to go after Ninfee.
Lennz yelled at Ninfee to run, and the Player
asked “Does Ninfee run?” The answer was No,
with a Random Event.
The Player rolled on the Event Focus Table
and got NPC Action. To determine which NPC
would act, the Player rolled two dice for the
Characters List: one for a List section and one
for an entry in that section. Since two sections of
the List have elements in them, the Player rolled
a d4 to see which section to use. They got a 3,
indicating the second section. Rolling a d10 to
see which element to use, the Player got a 2: “The
Chosen One”.
The Player rolled on the Actions Meaning
Tables for inspiration on what Ninfee would do
and got “Open” and “Power”. Given the Context
that the Chosen One supposedly has abilities of
some kind, the Player interpreted this to mean

that Ninfee reacted with a display of raw magical
power to defend himself.
After the orc was knocked back, the Player
asked, “Do the orcs flee?” Yes. Finally, the Player
asked, “Does Ninfee seem surprised by what he
did?” Yes.
This seems like a good place to end the Scene;
now it’s time for Bookkeeping. The Player
summarizes Scene 3 in the Adventure Journal and
adjusts the Chaos Factor.
While they did survive the orc ambush,
Ninfee’s sudden display of power was a random
surprise. The Player is going to count this as a
Scene out of Lennz’s control, raising the Chaos
Factor to 6.

Now to adjust the Lists. There’s no need to
add another instance of “Deliver the Chosen

“Avoid the orcs” was relevant in this Scene
because of the fight, so the Player repeats this
Thread element. They also add another instance
of “Orc warband” to the Characters List.

Travel is slow in the dark, but Lennz doesn’t dare
light a torch, only using the light of the moon
to see by. Dark clouds begin to gather, and the
temperature drops until it begins to snow. Ninfee is
cold, and both of them are tired, but Lennz urges
him to continue on even as the storm worsens.

The Player pauses to think before coming
up with the next Expected Scene idea. A lot
happened in that last Scene: the orcs discovered
them, and Ninfee displayed impressive powers.
The Player considers what Lennz might do next.
Since the orcs got away, it would be a good
idea to get moving before they come back
with reinforcements. Lennz could invest some
time in helping Ninfee explore his powers, but
considering how surprised the boy was by their
appearance trying to experiment with them right
now probably isn’t the best course of action.
The Player decides that Lennz is going to pack
up camp and get moving right away while it’s still
dark, covering their tracks as best he can to throw
off pursuers.
With this Expected Scene in mind, the Player
rolls a d10 to test it against the current Chaos
Factor value of 6. They roll 4. This is an even
number within the Chaos Factor range, which
means the next Scene is an Interrupt Scene—
something unexpected is about to happen.
To determine what the Interruption is, the
Player rolls on the Event Focus Table and gets
“PC Negative”. It looks like things are about to go
from bad to worse for Lennz and Ninfee.
The Player rolls on the Actions Meaning
Tables for inspiration on what happens and gets
“Hinder” and “Weather”. They interpret this to
mean that a snowstorm rolls in as the night wears
in. Now Lennz has to contend with freezing
weather while trying to stay ahead of the orcs.

Dawn finds them still trudging through snow.
They need to find shelter from the cold and get
a few hours of rest. Lennz scans the white-clad
hills around them, looking for any sign of a cave.
He spots something, but it’s not a cave—there’s a
column of smoke coming from the next ridge.
When Lennz paused to look for a possible cave
entrance, the Player asked, “Does he spot a cave?”
giving it Odds of Very Unlikely. They rolled an
Exceptional No.
Lennz saw something that was the opposite
of a cave, or a more intense version of the next
expectation. The Player decided it made the most
sense for him to see some sign of life.
The Player wasn’t sure what this sign was,
so they rolled on the Descriptions Meaning
Tables and got “Slowly” and “Dirty”. Their
interpretation was a column of smoke slowly
drifting into the sky, as if from a campfire.
The smoke looks like it could be from a campfire.
It might be a local mountain village, or the
orc warband. Lennz decides that either way it
deserves a look. He guides Ninfee toward the
smoke, keeping low and moving cautiously.
When they make it to the top of the ridge, they
look down and see a small mountain village. The
villagers seem rugged, accustomed to the harsh
conditions of their environment. The smoke is
coming from a fire that looks warm and inviting.

119

SCENES

Lennz knows that if he can see the smoke, so can
the orcs; they may be drawn to this location as
well. The village appears to have fighters among
them—perhaps they will ally with Lennz when
they find out Ninfee is the Chosen One. Lennz
decides to take the risk and approach them.
When Lennz got in position to identify the
source of the fire, the Player asked the Fate
Question, “Is it the orcs?” They gave this Odds of
50/50 because they had no idea what to expect.
Mythic came back with No.
The next most logical expectation was that
it’s a village, so the Player went with that. To get
a clearer picture of the village, the Player asked,
“Do they look capable?” Mythic came back with
Exceptional Yes.
The Player interpreted this to mean that not
only are the villagers well equipped against the cold
and the storm, they also have fighters among them.

The orcs were a concern in this Scene, so the
Player adds another instance of “Avoid the orcs” to
the Threads List, reaching the maximum of three.
The Player decides that the sudden storm
is enough to count as the environment acting
against them, so they add “Mountains” again
to the Characters List. They also add another
instance of “Villagers”.

Guardian of the Chosen One

As Lennz and Ninfee walk towards the village,
a pair of spear-wielding warriors see them and
approach. They look tough and threatening,
but as soon as they see Ninfee their demeanor
changes. They recognize him immediately and
their wary greeting changes to one of welcome.
To Lennz’s relief, he and Ninfee are brought into
the circle of warmth and given food. There isn’t
much time to relax, however. Lennz tells the
villagers about the orcs. The villagers have been
fending off warband raiders for months, and
they are ready and willing to help Lennz defend
the boy.
The Player resolved the villager reactions with a
few Fate Questions. “Do they recognize Ninfee?”
Yes. “Are they aware of the warband?” Yes.
This seems like a good place to end Scene 4
and do some Bookkeeping. The Player writes
down a summary of this Scene. Since Lennz and
Ninfee caught a lucky break, the Player decides
Lennz was in control this Scene, so the Chaos
Factor drops from 6 to 5.

Lennz begins his journey
and gets to know Ninfee.

Variations
The Mythic system is built to be modular
and highly customizable. Use the rules you
want, ignore the ones you don’t, and adjust the
ones you’ve chosen to get the desired tone for
your adventures.
Up to this point, the systems in this book have
focused on the essentials of how to construct
and run a satisfying solo role-playing experience.
Many of those core rules offer options for how
to use them, such as the way you start and end
Scenes and whether you roll for an Event Focus
or choose one. This chapter presents more
variant rules with which to modify your Mythic
experience as well as advice on how to get more
out of your adventures.
If you’re new to Mythic, this chapter may be
more useful to you after you’ve played through a
few adventures and familiarized yourself with the
core rules.

FORM FITTING
To make it easier to get organized, all forms and
tables have been collected at the end of this
book. You can also find a quick reference for all
of Mythic’s important rules and mechanics in the
“Rules Summary” chapter.

GETTING PREPARED
FOR A SOLO
ADVENTURE

If you prefer to play with physical books and
paper game sheets, keeping things organized will
make your solo gaming sessions more enjoyable.
Consider sorting your sheets into binders, one
for rulesets and one for Character-related items.
Gather all of your materials ahead of time and
lay them out on the surface you’ll be using. Make
sure you have enough room to write things down
when you need to and enough empty space to
shift things around without moving too many
items at once.
For my own games, I make a habit of taking all
the books and resources I’m using and stacking
them together so I can put them on a bookshelf
in between my adventures. When it’s time to play,
I simply grab the stack, arrange it on the table in

Getting your act together to run a solo roleplaying session can be just as individualized as the
game itself. What resources do you bring to the
table—if you even use a table? Do you role-play
entirely in your head, or do you write down what
happens as you go? If you do write it down, how
do you go about it?
There’s a lot to consider, so let’s get started on
how to get started!

front of me, and get to playing. Then, when I’m
done, I restack them and put them back on the
shelf. Keeping your notes and reference sheets
“stackable” like this in a folder or binder makes
your entire adventure easy to pull out and easy to
put away.
If you’re new to solo role-playing, it may take
several game sessions for you to hit upon your
own ideal setup. While you’re playing, take note
of organizational strategies that seem to help
and points of frustration to resolve for your next
session. Once you’ve found the way you like to
play, you’ll be able to get yourself set up just right.

ONLINE RESOURCES
The web is chock full of resources for use with
solo role-playing. There are numerous online
guides with lists of resources, so I’ll just touch on
a few here that are most relevant to Mythic play
to get you started.

Sourcing An Idea
You may be going solo, but you can still get
some help with ideas. You can take inspiration
from books, movies, TV shows, comics, anime
… anything you enjoy. Maybe you use a few
general concepts as the basis of a first Scene, or
maybe you take things further and populate your
Threads and Characters Lists with ideas from the
sourced material, creating adventure goals and
NPCs before you even start the opening Scene.
Sourcing an idea like this is a good way to quickly
get the ball rolling with something that captures
your interest from the very start.

Linear Vs. Sandbox
I think many of us tend to approach our
adventures in a linear fashion. It’s second
nature at this point—we’re used to consuming
narratives with a start, a middle, and an end, and
traditional group role-playing is often structured
this way as well. However, you may also want to
consider trying a sandbox approach, which works
especially well with solo role-play.
A sandbox adventure can start off much lighter
than a linear adventure. All you need to know are
some basic facts: who your Character is, what kind
of world they live in, and what they’re doing as you

begin the adventure. Then your first Scene can
simply be plopping your Character into the setting
and seeing what happens. These kinds of adventures
can start off slow but quickly build momentum.
For instance, let’s say you have a Player
Character who flies a starship and ferries goods
from planet to planet with her tight-knit crew, and
you know the setting well: a discrete portion of
the galaxy with trade routes, governments, and a
few warring factions. You might start with a basic
Thread like “Complete the current shipment”
and a Characters List made up of your crew and
the ports you most commonly dock at. The First
Scene might be your PC making sure the ship is
secure and that there are no threats in the vicinity.
Now all you have to do is begin playing.

124

VARIATIONS

The advantage of a sandbox approach is that
you can start with little to no story ideas, knowing
that sooner or later, Mythic will throw things your
way that crank up the action in your adventure.

THEATER OF THE MIND
Not all of us record our adventures in written
or digital form: some of us play out everything
in our heads. We may jot down a few notes, like
Scene summaries and adventure highlights, but
we’re recording the bulk of the adventure in our
memories as we play.

Recording Your Adventure
This section summarizes the various different
approaches to recording your adventure as you play.

There can be some psychological resistance to
playing a Theater of the Mind style of adventure.
Maybe you feel as though if it isn’t recorded in
some material fashion, then it didn’t happen.
Or maybe it just seems strange to sit there
by yourself, silently rolling dice and consulting
charts, while all the action takes place between
your ears.

JOURNAL
An easy way to record your adventure is to
keep a notebook and write it out journal style.
This can be as simple as writing “Scene 1” at the
top of the page, recording a summary of what
happened, and moving on to the next Scene. You
can also use your journal to keep track of game
details like the Chaos Factor.
Some people like to journal out more details
until it’s practically a story, while others record
just enough information to remind them later of
what happened.
Not only does a journal allow you to go back
and re-read your adventure, it also helps if you’re
short on time and have to break your adventure
into many smaller sessions—for example, maybe
you can only squeeze in a few Scenes before bed
and then you won’t get to play again for a few
more days. When you finally get back to playing,
a quick glance at the journal will remind you
what happened in your adventure and where you
left off.

If you think about it, though, a Theater of the
Mind solo role-playing experience isn’t all that
different from other forms of entertainment. The
active elements of fiction take place entirely in
our minds: we sit passively while watching movies
and TV shows, silently absorbing what we see
and hear, and we are the only witnesses when
we play single player video games. Reading is a
solo experience, with nothing but a book and our
imagination, and yet it can make our emotions
take flight. These experiences come from external
physical sources, but the enjoyment of them is all
in our heads.
Theater of the Mind solo role-playing is no
different: there’s the external, physical input of
the dice and game mechanics we’re using and the
internal experience of us enjoying it. Additionally,
solo role-playing is an active experience that
requires our constant input and involvement,
making that Theater in your mind a rich and
interesting place.

BLOG
Go public with your adventures and make
a blog of it! There are tons of Players out there
sharing their recorded adventures. In addition to
being fascinating reading, it’s also a window into
how others play solo, which can offer new and
insightful perspectives.
A blog gives you a simple and elegant way to
record your adventures while exposing them to

an audience who will appreciate them. This is
a way to bring the social element back into solo
play, and on a psychological level, presenting your
adventures to the public can make your adventure
feel more “real”, which is a source of satisfaction
in and of itself.

125

VARIATIONS

NOVELIZATION
This approach is not for the faint of heart, but
it can be very satisfying. When you novelize your
adventure, you write out everything that happens
in detail as you play, like writing a book.
You can make this work by going back and
forth between mechanical game elements and
writing. Ask and answer a series of Fate Questions
about a combat your Player Character is involved
in, then turn to your computer and write it all out
in detail, taking a good deal of creative license.
When you’ve run out of material to write about,
go back to the adventure and resolve the next
step. This back-and-forth process chronicles the
adventure paragraph by paragraph and chapter by
chapter until it’s been fully written out and you’ve
essentially written a novel.
Novelizing your adventure records the action
in great detail, but it is also very, very slow. This
style of recording works well for those who really
enjoy writing and aren’t in a hurry to move your
adventure along.
One satisfying benefit of novelizing your
adventure is the ability to come back to it later—

even months or years later—and re-read the
adventure, transporting yourself back to the frame
of mind you were in when you played it out.

NOTE & EDIT METHOD
If you want a more complete written account
but find writing while playing intrusive to the flow
of gameplay, you can try a note and edit approach.
Focus on your adventure as you play, recording
simple summary notes as you go. Then, after your
adventure session, revisit the notes and take the
time to write them out as a cohesive narrative.
This approach gives you the speed of theater
of the mind with the detail of journaling. How
much detail you write is up to you—whether you
take ten minutes to flesh out the summaries or
an hour to turn them into a story, separating this
process from gameplay lets you focus on roleplaying in the moment.

Piecemeal Playing
Solo role-playing gives us a lot of freedom,
not only in the stories we experience but also in
the time we allot to playing them. If you can’t
grab a three-hour block of time to play out a full
solo adventure, consider breaking it up. As a solo
Player, you only have yourself to please, so there’s
no one who’s going to complain if you stop the
adventure because you have to run an errand or
pick up the kids. I know people who play a few
Scenes on their train ride to or from work, using
their phone or tablet to roll dice and record what
happens. You don’t need a lot of materials to play
Mythic, nor do you need a lot of time.
Breaking your adventure up into small bites also
has the benefit of giving you time to think about
it. When I break up an adventure, I often have as
much fun thinking about it in the time between
sessions as I do when I’m actually playing. I make
plans for what my Player Character will do and
cook up the basis for the next Expected Scene.

VARIATIONS

DETERMINING
NPC STATISTICS

NPC STATISTICS TABLE

Your Player Character is almost certainly going
to encounter NPCs during their adventure, and
if you’re using Mythic with another role-playing
game, you’re going to need to know the statistics
for those NPCs. You may need to know their
armor value when you attack them, how much
damage they do when they strike, how many hit
points they have, and so on.
You can resolve the statistics of the NPCs as
you encounter them through Fate Questions.

Expected Statistic Value
When determining a value for an NPC
statistic, first decide what you most expect the
value to be. For instance, you might expect a
small water elemental encountered in a dungeon
to have a slam attack that does 1d6 damage.
Go with the expectation that seems most
reasonable to you, taking the Context of your
adventure into account. If you had determined
that the water elemental was huge, towering
over your Player Character, a more reasonable
assumption of damage might be 2d6 or 1d10.
The power level of your Player Character
and the Context of the adventure should also
be factored in. Maybe your epic-level barbarian
wouldn’t even notice a 1d6 hit, and you’ve been
encountering monsters in this adventure that
regularly deliver damage in the 10+ range, so your
expectation for this creature is 1d10 damage.

FATE
QUESTION
RESULT

“DOES THE NPC HAVE A
STATISTIC VALUE OF X?”

Yes

The value is what you expect.

EXCEPTIONAL
YES

The value is higher than you
expect, by about 25%.

NO

The value is lower than you
expect, by about 25%.

EXCEPTIONAL
NO

The value is much lower than
you expect, by about 50%.

RANDOM
EVENT

There is a special condition
associated with this statistic.

Since the value you’re questioning is one you
came up with yourself as an expectation, your
Odds will probably be strong, such as Very Likely.
If you aren’t too sure about your expectation,
however, that uncertainty can be reflected in the
Odds. Maybe you have no idea how many hit
points an NPC has or what its armor value is, and
your expectation is just a wild guess. In that case,
you might assign Odds of 50/50.
A Yes result means that the value is what you
expect it to be. If you thought the water elemental
would do 1d6 damage, then it does 1d6 damage.
An Exceptional Yes result means the statistic
value is about 25% higher than you expected. In
this case, you might decide that the elemental
does 1d8 damage instead.
A No result means the NPC statistic is about
25% lower than you expected. In this case, you
might decide that the water elemental’s attack
does 1d4 damage.
An Exceptional No means the statistic is much
lower than expected, about 50% lower. In this
case, you might decide that the elemental does
1d3 damage.

Ask Mythic
After you’ve decided on a reasonable value for
the statistic, turn it into a Fate Question to see if
it’s true. “Does the NPC have this statistical value?”
Determine what you think the Odds are of the
answer being Yes, then resolve the Fate Question.

INSPIRATIONAL VS. PRACTICAL
While we’re talking about leveraging sourcebooks
for solo adventures, I’d like to make a distinction
between the two general ways they might be
used. The way I see it, a sourcebook is either
going to be inspirational or practical.

With our elemental, the Player rolled a Yes, so it
does 1d6 damage. They also generated a Random
Event. Rolling on the Actions Meaning Tables,
the Player gets “Proceed” and “Needs”. They
interpret this to mean that this creature’s mode of
attack is also how it feeds, so if a blow from the
elemental strikes bare skin, it causes additional
damage as corrosive toxins try to digest the target.

By inspirational, I mean that the book gives us
ideas that spark our imagination, even if we don’t
use the specific ideas themselves. For example,
you might like the setting of a graphic novel,
so you use a heavily customized version for
your own adventure setting. That would be an
inspirational sourcebook.
A practical sourcebook, in my view, is one you use
material from directly. These are RPG books with
statblocked monsters or specific settings where
you follow the descriptions as written. The details
are all there, and you import them into your
adventure largely as-is.

GETTING THE
MOST OUT OF
SOURCEBOOKS
I love a good sourcebook. There’s something
exciting about a resource chock full of content
and the knowledge that any of those ideas could
find their way into your adventure. It can be
anything that offers content for your adventure:
settings books, RPG core books, supplemental
rules, and the like.
The use of a sourcebook may seem obvious
when you have a Game Master running an
adventure. They will likely mine the book
for story hooks, adventure seeds, characters,
creatures, settings, and more. While a solo
Player will do the same, there are other, less
obvious ways to put a sourcebook to work for
solo role-playing.
For instance, maybe you play your adventures
using Mythic as your only rules, but you like to
incorporate the flavored content of published
RPGs. Since you aren’t using a specific RPG
ruleset, you could use books from unconnected
products—spells from one game, magic items
from another, and dungeon traps from a third.

It’s easier to mix and match RPG products when
playing solo, giving you more options for possible
sourcebooks for your adventures.
Sourcebooks don’t have to be RPG related.
I keep a book of monsters from one of my
favorite sci-fi television shows on my gaming
shelf. It’s an excellent sourcebook full of photos,
descriptions, situations the creatures have
appeared in, how they were dealt with, etc.
There is nothing role-playing about this book,
yet it’s a wonderful resource. I can randomly
choose a creature from the book and generate its
stats as I play.
Solo role-play relies heavily on improvisation,
not only with the content of our adventures but
also sometimes with the rules and mechanics
themselves. This makes it easier to add non-RPG
material into our adventures and convert them on
the fly into game mechanics.

World Building

OTHER MEDIA

A sourcebook can offer a ready-made world for
your Characters to inhabit. Maybe you’re using
the default setting detailed in an RPG book,
or perhaps you’re taking inspiration from your
new favorite streaming television show. Having a
reference point for the adventure universe makes
creating the first Scene that much easier.
There’s even more world-building we can get
out of sourcebooks, however.

While I’m using the term “book” a lot, sourcebooks
can come in any form. You can source material
from online blogs, magazine articles, music, the
summaries of your favorite television shows ...
anything you want.

“Scenes” chapter). A good sourcebook can do
the work for you.
Maybe your source is a published adventure
module. You don’t plan to use the adventure
itself, but you like the setup. You could use the
beginning of the module as the first Scene of
your adventure, populating your Threads and
Characters Lists with elements from that section,
and then proceed with a fully solo, Mythic-driven
adventure. It may go in a completely different
direction from what the published adventure
intended, but that content-rich start provided an
excellent opening.

POPULATING LISTS
If you’re going to use a sourcebook to create a
setting for your Player Character, then you may
want to consider pre-filling some of the Lists
before you start the first Scene, especially the
Characters List.
Let’s say you’re playing a Character in a weird
west style of adventure. You’re using Mythic for
the mechanics, but you’ve chosen a popular RPG
as a sourcebook of strange and supernatural old
west ideas. You’ve decided this is going to be your
setting and picked out a town detailed in the
book, reading up on some of the more interesting
features to be found there.
The bits you find most interesting could be
added to your Lists. You might put the town
itself on the Characters List in an entry like “The
people of Raven Gulch.” Maybe the sheriff is an
important figure in town, so you add “Sheriff
Turner” to the List. Maybe your sourcebook
mentions that the local gold mines are thought
to be haunted, and you add “Haunted mines” to
include them in your adventure. Now you have
some interesting elements at play before you’ve
even begun playing.

SOURCING VALUABLE DETAILS
Sourcebooks are treasure troves of valuable
elements that don’t even have to be tied to the
type of adventure you’re running to be useful.
For instance, maybe you’re playing a futuristic
adventure set in an apocalypse, but a wonderful
fantasy map from an adventure module fits that
world’s geography perfectly.
One of the many strengths of solo role-playing
is that we only have ourselves to please. You
get to decide what rules to use, what elements
to bring into our adventures, what to combine,
and how to combine them. You can choose to
use the weaponry from an RPG about spacefaring merchants, the Found Items table from a
game about zombie rampage, and the Riding on
Dragons rules from your favorite fantasy game,
tying all these disparate elements together using
Mythic Fate Questions.

MAKING THE FIRST SCENE

Detailed encounters are another valuable
resource you can pull from published adventures.

repurposed for custom use.

Sourcebooks As A Tool
Not only is a sourcebook a repository of great
ideas, it can also be treated like a game element
itself, such as a table or other random resource.

RANDOMLY DETERMINING
YOUR SOURCE
This idea may seem strange, but it’s how I
start most of my solo games, and I love it. I have
several shelves of sourcebooks and role-playing
books, and when I’m ready for a brand new
adventure, I’ll roll to determine which bookcase,
which shelf, and which book on the shelf will be
my primary source for this adventure. This turns
my bookshelves into giant random tables.
Making the act of sourcebook selection itself
a randomized part of the adventure is a fun way
to play before you start playing, allowing you to
world-build randomly.

VARIATIONS

BOOKS AS RANDOM TABLES

“FANTASTIC BATTLES” FOR THE WIN

Treating sourcebooks as random tables is a
good way to spark your imagination. A book is
practically designed for this, with page numbers
conveniently similar to numbers on a table.
Let’s say you’ve chosen an RPG about space
exploration as your sourcebook. To get inspiration
for your adventure, you roll a random page and
land on a section about the various colonies found
throughout the settled galaxy. You can use this
information as inspiration for the world your
Player Character comes from.
Find the last page of useful material in the
book and treat that number as the dice range.
For example, I have a sourcebook on battlefield
warfare for my fantasy RPG. The book has about
255 pages, but the content that is useful for my
adventure ends at page 250. I would consider the
random range to be 1-250.
You could roll for a random page in this range
using a d4 to establish the hundreds digit (treating
3 as 0 and rerolling a 4) and a d100 for the tens
and ones digits. Alternatively, you could use a
numbers generator app to work within the exact
range. If you roll up something useless for your
adventure, like a “How to Use This Book” page,
you simply reroll. Once you have the page, you
can select the content on that page that makes the
most sense in the current Context to incorporate
into your adventure.
Using sourcebooks as random tables like this
provides interesting opportunities to inject their
contents into an adventure in unexpected ways.
You could even include the sourcebook itself in
your adventure’s Characters List, putting the
title of the book as a Character. Whenever this
“Character” gets rolled for a Random Event,
you would randomly select a page and use an
element from that page as the basis for that
Random Event.
Remember that the Characters List is meant
to include any element in your adventure that
can interact with your Character in some way;

The Player Character is a sorceress accompanying
a warband as they try to defend their land from
invaders. The adventure is war themed, and
the Scenes so far have involved the PC going on
missions with the soldiers.
In the current Scene, the Player Character is
traveling with a swordsman as they search the
forest for signs of the enemy army. It’s near
evening, and there’s a light dusting of snow on the
ground. They move cautiously, mindful that the
enemy might be near.
In the course of asking a Fate Question, the
Player generates a Random Event with a Focus
of NPC Action. Rolling on the Characters List
for the NPC, the Player gets “Fantastic Battles”,
the title of a sourcebook they added to the
List. The first 300 pages have lots of good
content, so the Player rolls for a page and gets
62. The Player turns to that page and finds it
has a list of backgrounds for characters. One
of the backgrounds, about outlaws who have
to scavenge for themselves, stands out to
the Player, and they decide to use that as the
inspirational element for the Event.
Rolling on the Event Meaning Tables to help
interpret this Random Event, the Player gets
“Assist” and “Tactic”. They interpret this to mean
that a refugee from one of the war-torn towns
nearby comes upon the PC. This person has been
foraging in the woods, stealing supplies from
the invading armies to get by. He spotted the PC
scouting and wants to assist, saying he knows
where the enemy is and where they are going.

it doesn’t have to be an actual NPC. In this
case, we are treating a sourcebook as a Character
and a randomly determined element from the
sourcebook as inspiration for the Random Event.

The Player’s modern mage Character has set out
on a quest to restore the manna of a fellow mage
whose powers were drained by an otherworldly
creature. The Thread representing this goal is
“Restore Bakra’s manna.” The Player decides to
start a Thread Progress Track with this Thread as
the Focus Thread.
In a later Scene, the PC learns about Fay Jars,
containers meant to imprison supernatural
creatures. Since this discovery represents a
significant step toward resolving the current
Thread, the Player counts it as Progress. When
the PC successfully makes a Fay Jar a few Scenes
later, the Player counts this as further Progress.

HOW THIS FITS INTO
YOUR ADVENTURE
Apart from the special rules of the Thread
Progress Track, your Mythic game continues as
normal, and the Thread you chose as the Focus still
operates like any other Thread in the adventure. It’s
up to you how much of your attention you want
to spend actively pursuing that Thread, but given
the nature of the Thread Progress Track, you will
experience the Focus Thread one way or another as
your adventure continues.

Any Scene that moves the Player Character
significantly closer to resolving the Focus
Thread should be considered Progress, though
you get to decide exactly what does and doesn’t
count. Making Progress awards 2 Progress
Points on the Thread Progress Track; cross out
the numbered boxes as you go to keep track of
your current Progress.

VARIATIONS

IS IT PROGRESS OR A FLASHPOINT?

Restore Bakra’s manna

✘ ✘ ✘✘

Making Progress and experiencing a Flashpoint
are very similar. Both involve the Focus Thread
in a meaningful way: Progress is anything that
moves you closer to resolving the Focus Thread,
while a Flashpoint is specifically a dramatic,
important event that involves the Focus Thread.

The Player Character made Progress toward the Thread of “Restore
Bakra’s manna” by learning about Fay Jars, earning 2 Progress Points.
In a later Scene they successfully constructed a jar, earning another 2
points for a total of 4 Progress Points so far.

A moment in a Scene can count as both
Progress and a Flashpoint. In these cases,
you can choose which to call it. Either earns
you 2 Progress Points, though having a
Flashpoint event means another Flashpoint
won’t automatically happen when you cross the
threshold of a Phase.

Flashpoint
A Flashpoint is an important moment in a
Scene that’s related to the Focus Thread. They
can be initiated through normal Mythic play, a
Random Event involving the Thread, or through
the Thread Progress Track.
A Flashpoint is very similar to Progress, with
one key difference: a Flashpoint event should
be dramatic and important. You can consider
this part of the Context when interpreting a
Flashpoint event.
During a Scene, the Player’s mage PC finds the
place where the creature has taken up residence:
in the high-end apartment of a tech millionaire.
She attempts to trap the creature in the Fay
Jar in a frantic chase through the apartment,
destroying furniture and valuables as the
creature, a small, elf-like humanoid, runs and
flies about.
This encounter is dramatic, directly involves
the Focus Thread, and offers hope of eventually
resolving the Thread. It has all the qualities to
make it a Flashpoint.
A Flashpoint awards 2 Progress Points on
the Thread Progress Track, just like standard
Progress. Make sure to check off the box next to
“Did A Flashpoint Happen?” for that phase of the
Progress Track.

You can let the drama and tension of the Scene
help you decide if the event was a Progress or
a Flashpoint. Discovering the recipe for making
Fay Jars by studying a book isn’t very dramatic,
but it is forward motion, so that’s Progress.
Encountering the creature and battling it was
dramatic and tense, so that’s a Flashpoint.

THREAD PROGRESS
TRACK FLASHPOINT
A Flashpoint happens when your Player
Character goes through an important Scene
involving the Focus Thread. If this doesn’t
happen though regular Mythic play, the Thread
Progress Track will make it happen.
The Thread Progress Track is broken into
phases of 5 Progress Points each. If a Flashpoint
hasn’t happened by the end of a phase, then a
Flashpoint event is triggered. Treat this like a
Random Event with an automatic Event Focus of
Current Context. The Random Event will involve
the Focus Thread in a dramatic and important
way without fully resolving it. Roll on the Event
Meaning Tables for inspiration.

TIMING PROGRESS & FLASHPOINTS

Restore Bakra’s manna

✘

✘ ✘ ✘ ✘✘ ✘

You can record Progress Points at any time,
whether during the Scene as you play or after
the Scene as part of your regular end-of-Scene
Bookkeeping. When you mark it down may
depend on when you think to do so. Maybe the
action of the Scene was so exciting that you didn’t
stop to consider if it was Progress or a Flashpoint
until after the Scene was over.

The Player Character had an encounter with the supernatural
creature she’s trying to capture. The Player decides that since this
event was dramatic and had the potential to resolve the Focus Thread
that it’s more important than just Progress, it’s a Flashpoint. The
Player marks off 2 more Progress Points, raising the total to 6, and
checks the “Did A Flashpoint Happen?” box for this phase. Getting to
6 Progress Points passed the 5 point threshold that would trigger a
Flashpoint. However, the Player had decided that a Flashpoint event
had just occurred in this Scene so another one isn’t triggered.

The timing of when you record Progress Points
only matters if they trigger a Flashpoint. If you’re
recording Progress Points as a Scene plays out,
and you cross the threshold between phases
that triggers a Flashpoint, you can generate the
Flashpoint right then. This is a lot like when a
Random Event is triggered by a Fate Question.

Discovery Checks

If a Flashpoint is triggered when you’re recording
your Progress Points as part of Bookkeeping,
then it will occur at the start of your next Scene.
You will still generate the next Scene normally,
coming up with an Expected Scene and testing it
to see if it’s Altered or Interrupted, but however
the Scene pans out, it will still include the
Flashpoint event. Once you’ve started the Scene,
you can roll for the specifics of the Flashpoint to
see what happens.

Progress along the Track is usually made by
the Player Character through normal Mythic
play. The Player is seeking to resolve the Thread,
so they take steps to do so, just like you would in
any Mythic adventure.
But what happens if you run out of ideas for
how to proceed? The point of the Thread Progress
Track is to keep the Focus Thread active, so we
need a way to push forward when the adventure
stalls. Enter the Discovery Check, a special kind
of Fate Question for making Progress when you
don’t know where to look for it.
To make a Discovery Check, your Player
Character has to do something to trigger it. This
can be anything that presents an opportunity
to make a discovery: reaching out to a contact,
consulting a book, or even just waiting for
something to happen. Then you can ask the Fate
Question, “Is something discovered?” assigning
Odds based on the current Context.
The more contextually appropriate the action,
the better the chances of discovering something
useful, but unlike a regular Fate Question, the
Odds can never be worse than 50/50 regardless
of what the PC does. Narratively speaking,

this encourages your PC to put genuine effort
into seeking out a discovery, but even the most
low-effort attempt on their part gives them a
decent shot at finding something. The goal of
the Discovery Check is to get the action moving
again, so results are biased in the PC’s favor to
some degree.
Consult the Discovery Fate Question Table for
an explanation of the Fate Question answers.
After successfully building a Fay Jar, the Player’s
mage Character failed to capture the creature
during her chaotic encounter with it in the
apartment. Now she’s stuck, unsure how else to
move toward resolving the Thread. It’s time to
try for a Discovery Check.

DISCOVERY FATE QUESTION

DISCOVERY CHECKS AND NARRATIVE

FATE
QUESTION
RESULT

The Discovery Check is a mechanic designed to
kickstart a stalled adventure and get it moving
again. It doesn’t take much action on the part of
the Player Character to make a Discovery Check,
but whatever they do should have narrative
meaning. “I stare out the window and hope that
something happens” is no fun. “I review the clues
again to look for something I missed” is better.
Not only do better reasons make for better
narratives, but they should also give you better
Odds of a Yes answer to the Discovery Check
Fate Question.

The Player decides that for the next Expected
Scene, the PC will return to her personal library
of magical books and take another look through
them to see if she’s missed something useful. This is
enough of an action to make a Discovery Check.
The PC already checked her library for clues in
a previous Scene, so as far as attempts to trigger
a Discovery Check go, going over her books
again is pretty low effort. The Player decides
that checking the library gives her 50/50 Odds
to successfully discover something. Under normal
circumstances, they would have given this
Question Odds of Very Unlikely, but the Odds of
a Discovery Check can’t go below 50/50, so those
are the Odds they use.

THREAD DISCOVERY
CHECK TABLE
A successful Discovery Check earns you a roll
on the Thread Discovery Check Table. Treat
this as a Random Event that uses the Thread
Discovery Check Table instead of the Event Focus
Table. This will tell you what aspect of the Focus
Thread to hone in on and what bonus you receive
on the Progress Track.

“IS SOMETHING
DISCOVERED?”

YES

Roll on the Thread
Discovery Check Table.

NO

Nothing useful is found.
There is no roll on the Thread
Discovery Check Table.

EXCEPTIONAL
YES

Roll twice on the Thread
Discovery Check Table,
combining results.

EXCEPTIONAL
NO

Not only is nothing useful
discovered and you don’t
roll on the Thread Discovery
Check Table, but you can’t
make another Discovery
Check for the rest of this
Scene. Your Character
has hit a dead end when
it comes to Discovery
and must continue such
searches in another Scene.

To roll on the Thread Discovery Check Table,
roll 1d10, add the current number of Progress
Points, and consult the table for your result. Then,
just like with a Random Event, roll on the Event
Meaning Tables of your choice for inspiration to
help you interpret the Discovery.
Progress +2 / +3: You discover something that
moves you closer to the Focus Thread, giving you
2 or 3 Progress Points.
Flashpoint +2 / +3: You discover something
that involves the Focus Thread in an important
and dramatic way, giving you 2 or 3 Progress
Points in the process.

136

VARIATIONS

Track +1 / +2: You didn’t discover anything
useful, but just the act of trying moves you along
the Thread Progress Track by 1 or 2 points.
Strengthen Progress +1 / +2: Some Progress
previously made is reinforced, earning you 1 or 2
Progress Points. Treat this as a regular discovery
that results in Progress, but tie it into a previous
discovery. For instance, the mage Character made
Progress when she learned what Fay Jars were.
A later Thread Discovery Check that results in
Strengthen Progress could be interpreted as the
mage acquiring components necessary to build a
Jar, tying it in to this earlier discovery.

THREAD DISCOVERY CHECK

INTERPRETING A DISCOVERY
Making a successful Discovery Check and
getting a roll on the Thread Discovery Check
Table essentially triggers a Random Event that
Progresses your Player Character toward the
Focus Thread. Interpret the results you rolled
on the Thread Discovery Check Table and the
Meaning Tables as you would a Random Event.
Remember, however, that if the Thread Discovery
Check Table indicates this Event is a Flashpoint,
then it should be dramatic and important.

This is excellent news for the mage. She knows
where her friend was attacked, and if this
information is correct, then going back to that
place may provide another chance to capture
the creature.

The mage Player Character hits her arcane books
again, looking for any information she might
have missed that could help. Her Player asks the
Discovery Check Fate Question, and the answer
is Yes. This means they get to roll on the Thread
Discovery Check Table to see what happens.

The Player marks off 2 more Progress Points
and prepares for the next Scene, now with a way
forward in mind.

With Progress Points currently at 6, the Player
rolls 1d10+6 and gets a total of 8, a result of
“Progress +2”. They choose the Actions Meaning
Tables to roll on and get “Imitate” and “Failure”.

Plot Armor
The goal of the Thread Progress Track is to
give Mythic a way to help you progress toward
the completion of a Thread. While the end is
achievable, you have to reach milestones along the
way, such as Flashpoints, to get to it. This means
you can’t resolve the Thread until you’ve reached
the full amount of Progress Points and engaged in
the Conclusion.

The Player interprets the results this way: Rereading her books, the mage discovers a story she
previously missed. It tells of a sorcerer long ago who
dealt with a manna stealing imp and noted that
the creatures are almost always drawn back to the
locations where they consumed a source of manna.

137

VARIATIONS

Plot Armor is the rule that protects the
Thread until you reach the Conclusion.
Consider it Context that says: “The Thread
cannot be resolved until the Conclusion.”
Normal Mythic play or Flashpoints cannot
end the Thread before its time. No matter
what happens in a Scene, Plot Armor requires
intervention in any case that would cause the
Thread to be completed early.
We know the mage hunting the mannathieving imp won’t capture it in the apartment
Scene because we haven’t reached the Conclusion
yet in the Thread Progress Track. Let’s say
there’s a moment when the Player Character has
the upper hand and is about to bring the Fay
Jar down on the creature. At the last second,
the PC trips on a lamp that was knocked over
during the chaos. She falls to the floor, the Jar
rolling across the carpet, as the creature flies out
a window and escapes.

MAKE PLOT ARMOR WORK FOR YOU
This idea of Plot Armor is a heavy-handed
approach to guiding the narrative, especially for
Mythic, where events are generally guided by
Questions and expectations.
When protecting a Thread with Plot Armor, you
know ahead of time that the Player Character
won’t be able to resolve the Thread until all the
Progress Points are scored. This means you
already know how Scenes that involve the Thread
Focus are going to turn out—or at least, how they
won’t turn out. But even though you approach
Scenes with this knowledge, you still don’t know
exactly how the Scenes will play out. Sure, your
Character won’t resolve the Thread this Scene,
but what else might happen? What will failure to
resolve the Thread look like?
I encourage you to have fun with Plot Armor.
The Thread Progress Track is meant to apply a
cinematic experience to tackling a Thread, giving
you more of a hand in directing the outcome of
some Scenes.

CLOSE A THREAD
Plot Armor also protects the Thread from a
Random Event with an Event Focus of Close A
Thread. Play out the Random Event as normal but
with the extra Context that the Thread will not
actually be closed. The Random Event may look
like it’s going to close the Thread, but it doesn’t.

When deciding how Plot Armor intervenes in your
Scenes, follow the Context and what you expect
might happen to keep a Thread from being
resolved early. If you don’t have a clear idea in
mind, roll on the Meaning Tables for inspiration.

The mage PC is at a secret nightclub for magical
folk and supernatural creatures in the city. She
hopes to find a certain shaman who allegedly has
had experience with manna-thieving fay.

The Player plays out the Scene, knowing
that Plot Armor will prevent this Event from
concluding the Thread. They ask the Fate
Question “Did they lie?”, giving it Odds of
Nearly Certain, to determine what actually
happens and interprets the Yes to mean that the
mage is attacked when she gets to the back room
by mages who are also trying to track down the
manna thief. They want to take the power it’s
collected for themselves, and attacking the PC is
an attempt to remove competition.

During this Scene, the Player rolls a Random
Event with an Event Focus of Close A Thread.
The Thread invoked is the same as the Focus
Thread.
The Player rolls on the Event Meaning tables as
usual and interprets the Random Event as this:
someone comes up to the Player Character and
says that the shaman is in a back room and has
already captured the fay.

Conclusion

The mage Player Character has enlisted more help
in capturing the thieving fay and has made more
Fay Jars to contain it. The Player has racked up

The goal of the Thread Progress Track is to
make enough Progress and encounter enough
dramatic Flashpoint moments to finally reach
the Conclusion and have the opportunity to
resolve the Thread. You arrive at the Conclusion
by scoring the full Progress Points on the Thread
Progress Track (10, 15, or 20 Points, depending
on the Track you select).
You can think of this Conclusion as a
Flashpoint with the Plot Armor removed. The
Focus Thread is no longer protected and can now,
finally, be resolved. The Conclusion event should
be dramatic and important, just like a Flashpoint,
giving the Player Character the opportunity to
finally close the Thread.
Like a Flashpoint that’s triggered by the
Thread Progress Track, the Conclusion is also
treated like a Random Event. The Event Focus
is automatically Current Context: this is the
Conclusion, Plot Armor is gone, and the event
should set the stage for a dramatic way for the PC
to end the Thread. Choose a Meaning Table to
roll on to help interpret the event.

DELAYING THE CONCLUSION
If it’s possible for the Conclusion to happen
when the Progress Points trigger it, then have it
happen right then, in the midst of that Scene.
However, given all the circumstances that may be
involved in making the Conclusion happen, the
event may not fit into the current moment. In this
case, delay the Conclusion to the next Scene.
If you delay the Conclusion, then come up
with an Expected Scene as you normally would,
including the details of the Conclusion. Don’t test
the Expected Scene against the Chaos Factor—
since the Thread Progress Track has triggered a
Conclusion, it guarantees that the Expected Scene
will begin as you imagine it.

In an adventure involving returning two demons back to the Netherworld,
the Player Character has a big problem: it’s only possible to complete
the banishing spell if both demons are together. The Player made a
Focus Thread out of “Banish the demons”, with Progress and Flashpoints
all revolving around trying to get the two hellspawn in the same room
together so the exorcism could be cast. The Conclusion event involves all
the factors finally coming into place.

VARIATIONS

DIVERSIFYING
THREADS

IT’S OVER ... OR IS IT?
Considering all the Progress and Flashpoint events
the Player Character has gone through to get to
the end of a Thread Progress Track, they are well
poised to finish the Thread during the Conclusion
in a dramatic and satisfying way. However, it’s
possible that the Thread won’t be closed during
the Conclusion. It’s not guaranteed; it’s just a very
good opportunity for it. Even though this is the
Conclusion, the Scene may play out in such a way
that the Thread is not actually closed.
Regardless of what happens, the Thread Progress
Track is considered completed. Rules pertaining
to the Focus Thread, including Plot Armor, no
longer apply, and the Thread is treated like any
other Thread. If the Player Character fails to
conclude the Thread during the Conclusion, then
the Thread will continue to exist on the Mythic
Threads List like any other thread to be resolved
through normal Mythic play.

more Progress Points along the way, and the Track
just hit 15, triggering the Conclusion.
At the moment, the PC is in a meeting with her
friends, plotting their strategy to ambush the
fay. This meeting counted as Progress, earning
the final 2 points that push them into 15. The
Player thinks it wouldn’t be appropriate to have
the Conclusion just yet, so they delay it until the
next Scene.
When the Scene about the meeting has ended,
the Player comes up with the next Expected
Scene, fashioning it around the Conclusion to the
Thread Progress Track. They decide on this: The
mage and her allies camp out at the site Bakra
was attacked, ready to pounce on the creature
when it returns. There is no need to test this
Expected Scene against the Chaos Factor since
this is a delayed Conclusion to the Track.

A smuggler captain Player Character has docked
The Star Nautilus at a space port to resupply.
While there, the captain hears a rumor about
a scientist seeking safe passage to the outer rim.
They set up a meeting with the scientist, who says
the Syndicate, a harsh regime controlling many
planets in the region, has operatives pursuing
him. He’ ll pay the captain good credits to get
him where he wants to go safely. The PC decides
to take the job.
The Player adds the Thread “Transport the
scientist” to the Threads List. All done!
Or is it?
The above example seems clear and simple.
The Player Character comes across a goal that
sounds interesting, ferrying a scientist to a distant
planet, so the Player turns it into a new Thread.
But why stop there? You might be able to
summarize a Thread with a single sentence but
you can make a Thread more impactful in your
adventure by breaking it up into multiple Threads.
In the example the Player added the Thread
“Transport the scientist.” That works fine and
any Random Event that involves that Thread
has a lot of Context built into it: Move Away
From A Thread may mean the PC’s ship is under
attack by the pursuing agents forcing you to find
a longer, safer way to your destination. A Move
Toward A Thread result may involve the scientist
divulging why he is being hunted, revealing
something interesting and helpful.
Threads often have lots of meaning packed
into a simple summary and that meaning gets
unpacked as you experience Random Events and
make interpretations during your adventure.
However, you can make this task easier on
yourself by breaking a single Thread into multiple
Threads, essentially unpacking its Context in

advance. For instance, in the above example the
Player could have added the following Threads:
» Transport the scientist
» Find out why he’s being hunted
» Avoid the Syndicate
That’s three Threads, each a little different
from the others but all part of the same whole.
The first one is the primary Thread while the
second two are aspects of it.
Breaking a Thread up can make for richer
Random Events by having a more focused topic
to interpret. Rolling the Thread of “Avoid the
Syndicate” tells you that this Random Event will
involve the Syndicate in some way. The more
detailed Thread narrows the Context allowing
you to make a more granular interpretation with
this result than you might otherwise have done.

One of the greatest wonders of solo role-playing,
in my opinion, is the ability to play a role-playing
game completely by yourself and yet still be
surprised by what happens. You aren’t limited by
a linear storyline pre-determined by an author or
guide, the scope is unlimited. All you have to do is
ask Questions and keep moving forward.
Still, despite our best intentions, sometimes
the surprises can be spoiled when we, the Players,
know more than our Characters do. There are
lots of ways this can happen, and if you aren’t
prepared to deal with it you may find yourself
sitting in the middle of a solo gaming session
suddenly puzzling over how your Character
should act when you know something they don’t.

As the Player, you know that an army of animated clay golems is about to descend on this village, but your Character doesn’t know that yet. How
do you handle this?
141

VARIATIONS

PLAYER VS. CHARACTER
KNOWLEDGE STRATEGIES

At Its Simplest
When Mythic is played at its simplest the issue
of Character knowledge vs. Player knowledge is
handled automatically. Mythic is intended to act
as the Gamemaster for you. You know things, and
don’t know things, depending on what Mythic
reveals just as it would be with a live GM.
For instance, your thief Player Character
slipping into an ancient catacomb to rob a longdead king’s grave may not have any idea what to
expect to find in the dark depths, and neither will
you. You’ll find out by asking Fate Questions and
learning as your Character learns.
It’s tempting when playing this way to ask
Questions for information outside the scope of
your Character. For instance, while your thief
is making his way into the catacombs, out of
curiosity you ask “Is the place haunted?” There
are circumstances where this Question would
make sense to ask, but given the current Context
of the thief entering the tomb there is no basis
to ask this Question. Getting an answer now
would be information that the Player knows
and the Character does not, and doesn’t give a
good mechanism for the Player to act on that
knowledge now.
Keeping things at their simplest, just asking
the Questions that make the most sense and that
only your Character could know, is the easiest
way I know to sidestep the Player vs. Character
knowledge problem.

When It’s No Longer Simple
The thing is, not every solo adventure stays this
simple. There are lots of ways you, as the Player,
can learn things that your Character doesn’t know.
For instance, if you are soloing your way
through a published module you may already
know a ton of things your Character doesn’t know.
Also, how about resolving social skills like telling
if someone is lying, or doing things like finding

secret doors or hidden compartments? Should you
already know such secret places exist before your
Character searches for them?
Let’s go over some of these less simple situations
and review strategies for handling them.

TEST IT, ASK IT, THEN IT’S REAL
How do you resolve a Player Character
searching for something that a Game Master
would know is there but you, the solo Player, do
not? Secret doors are a good example, but it could
be anything from evidence of a crime to figuring
out if an NPC is lying.

142

VARIATIONS

I think the best way to deal with this dilemma
is for the Character to first try and discover the
hidden thing, either using the rules of your chosen
RPG or posing it as a Mythic Fate Question.
For instance, your warrior searches a room for
a secret door or your espionage Player Character
studies his informant to determine if he’s telling
the truth. In an adventure guided by a Game
Master you would make such a discovery roll to
find if something hidden is there. In this case,
you are making the roll to find if the possibility of
something hidden is there.
If you succeed at the test then you know
that the hidden thing is discovered if it exists.
Determine if the secret thing exists by posing it as
a Fate Question. “Does my warrior find a secret
door?” “Do I get the sense that he’s lying?”

CREATING ‘UNRELIABLE’ TENSION
By assuming that everything you know as the
Player that your Character doesn’t know is
unreliable information is a way to bring tension
back into an adventure that may otherwise have
become too predictable.
This strategy is going to appeal mostly to
simulationist Players who love surprises from
their adventures. Cinematic Players, who are
more interested in constructing a story, probably
aren’t going to be as concerned with knowing
things their PC’s don’t. In fact, knowing more may
be a feature to them instead of a flaw.

For instance, in the example above let’s say the
Player determined earlier that the high school
science teacher, Mr. Larkins, is responsible for
bringing the creatures into the world. He was using
machinery found in an abandoned lab when his
experiment to speak with the dead inadvertently
opened a portal into a chaotic dimension.
Now, later in the adventure, the Player
Character is in a Scene with Mr. Larkin and has
to decide whether to trust him. This might be
disappointing for you since you already know
Larkin is secretly responsible for the catastrophe
and is going to great lengths to cover it up.
To maintain the tension in this Scene the
Player could decide that Mythic might have been
wrong earlier. The only way to confirm it for sure
is for your Player Character to discover it through
normal play.
This is treating information in your
adventure as either reliable or unreliable. Reliable
information are facts your Player Character
discovers within the adventure, and unreliable
information are facts only the Player knows.
Unreliable facts are only possibilities until they are
made reliable by becoming part of a Scene.

RELIABLE VS. UNRELIABLE
INFORMATION
Given enough time and enough Questions you’re
going to know a lot of details about a lot of things
pertaining to your adventure. This is where Player
knowledge may expand past your Character’s.
In an adventure about teenagers dealing with
otherworldly forces, over the course of a dozen
Scenes the Player has worked out where the
creatures in the woods come from. At some point
while asking Fate Questions the Player discovered
who was responsible for letting the creatures into
our dimension, an important piece of information
that their Character doesn’t know yet.
If the Player gets to a Scene where it’s important
for their Character to know who is responsible
for the creature crisis how does the Player deal
with this? The Player already knows the answer,
which robs the tension in deciding if their
Character is going to trust the NPC or not.
One way to deal with this dilemma is
accepting that something you, the Player, learned
earlier in the adventure might be wrong.

143

VARIATIONS

GOING WITH IT
Solo role-playing styles differ among Players.
Some of us want a realistic, simulationist feel from
our games. Others want a more narrative driven,
cinematic experience.
If cinematic is your style then having greater
knowledge than your Player Character may not
be a problem. The more you, the Player, know the
more cohesively you can guide events. You may
know the space station’s reactor was sabotaged by
rebels, and while your Character may not know
this your superior knowledge allows you to design
Expected Scenes that grow the narrative.
In this case you may go with it when you
know more than your Character because you are
more interested in how the narrative as a whole
comes together than you are with surprises.
Going with being the omniscient observer is a
stylistic choice that makes for good cinematic or
literary narratives.
Embracing Player knowledge over Character
knowledge offers its own kind of excitement,
where you know your PC is trusting the wrong
people, is walking toward an ambush, is being
tricked by a foe, and you go with it because
you understand that Character and what they
would do. Knowing more in this Context is like
watching a movie where your omniscience serves
to heighten the tension because you know the
Character is making a mistake.

EXTRA KNOWLEDGE AS
AN RP OPPORTUNITY
That extra knowledge you have that your
Character doesn’t can be used as a role-playing
opportunity. It’s an indicator that your Character
should have a chance to earn that knowledge.
This approach calls for allowing your PC to
make some kind of check to see if they discover
the knowledge that you know.
For instance with that Character who is
about to walk into a trap that you are aware

of, maybe grant them a skill roll that the RPG
you’re using allows to see if they detect the
trap. If you know that the NPC they just met is
secretly an undead sorcerer disguised as a living
human you could give your PC the chance to
see if they figure it out.
The knowledge gap becomes a trigger where
you automatically allow the Player Character
a chance to find out. Player knowledge isn’t a
hindrance to adventure surprise, it’s a doorway
to role-playing gold. Your Character can’t act
on your superior knowledge unless they earn
it somehow, but that extra knowledge gives
them the chance to earn it when they otherwise
wouldn’t have had that chance.
This strategy is a middle ground between the
more simulationist “Test It, Ask It, Then It’s Real”
and the cinematic “Going With It” approaches.

could choose to select Move Toward A Thread as
the Event Focus instead of rolling for the Focus.
You might want to go one step further and
not only choose the Event Focus but also choose
the Thread to make sure this next Scene is about
progress toward the main adventure goal.
You probably wouldn’t want to take this option
with every Interrupt Scene. “Choosing The Event
Focus” gives guidelines on how often to take
control of an Event Focus. It may take only once
to bring an adventure back on point.

One of the great things about Mythic is it spins
your adventures in new and unexpected directions.
One of the worst things about Mythic? It spins
your adventures in new and unexpected directions.
Once you begin a solo adventure you don’t
know where it will lead. The adventure will branch
out and grow in complexity. While the beginning
and the middle are sure to happen, getting your
adventure to a pleasing and satisfying conclusion
is less guaranteed. Here are some suggestions
for how to make sure your adventure ends
conclusively and in a way that you will remember.

With our post apocalypse example the Player
Character, Oscar Bright, is trying to figure
out why people are disappearing. The Player
considers this to be their main Thread: “Solve
the mystery of the disappearances.” Although a lot
has been going on in this adventure the Player
feels stuck on how to proceed with the main
Thread. They just haven’t found any leads and
aren’t sure where to look next.

Move Toward A Thread
Sometimes a solid conclusion to a solo adventure
can feel out of reach because of lack of progress
on your primary Thread of interest. Maybe you’ve
gone five Scenes in your post apocalypse adventure
where your Player Character has failed to make
any headway on figuring out why people from his
settlement are disappearing. Lots of other things
have happened in the adventure: you helped stop
an attempted robbery, you assisted in stopping a
small riot over food rationing, and you recovered
lost horses that ran off during a storm.
But the main storyline of getting to the
bottom of why people have been disappearing
has stalled and you see no conclusive end to
this adventure in sight.
One way to keep your adventure on
track toward a conclusion is to use
the rules in the “Random Events”
chapter about choosing an Event
Focus. When you generate an
Interrupt Scene and you feel
your adventure needs to be
dragged back on track you

The Player is about eight Scenes into their
adventure and just wrapped up a Scene where
the PC succeeded in capturing a group of thieves
who tried to raid the
settlement’s supply
What’s a wasteland peace
keeper to do when he wants
to find missing people but
crises keep getting in the way?

145

VARIATIONS

stores. The next Expected Scene is about visiting
the jail to question the robbers.

USE CONTEXT TO POWER THE END

The Player tests the Expected Scene against the
Chaos Factor and it comes back as Interrupted.
Since the Player hasn’t chosen an Event Focus
yet in this adventure, and they don’t know how
to proceed with the main Thread, they decide
to choose the Event Focus for this Interrupt
instead of rolling for it. The Player selects
Move Toward A Thread and goes the extra
step of also selecting the Thread of “Solve the
mystery of the disappearances.”

Context is important in Mythic. Context informs
our expectations when making interpretations of
Mythic’s prompts.
Context can also apply to our expectations about
the meta aspects of the game. Wanting to make
the conclusion of your adventure special is,
itself, Context. You can use it to help power your
interpretations in this final Scene.
For instance, your warrior has caught up with the
dread lich Brizas for a final confrontation. This
is the Thread conclusion you’ve been working
toward. You’re not sure if Brizas will fight or flee,
so you ask the Fate Question, “Does he fight?”
and get a Yes.

The Player completes the Interrupt Random Event
by rolling on the Meaning Tables for inspiration
and gets “Inform” and “Enemy”.
The Player interprets the results this way:
Oscar enters the jail where the three thieves are
slumped in a cell. Before he questions them one
starts talking about how they had to steal the
settlement’s food and supplies because another
group has been stealing theirs. This is new
information as the PC wasn’t aware there was
another community operating in the area. The
Player realizes this mystery group may be the ones
responsible for the missing townsfolk.
In this example the Player’s adventure took a
turn toward the main Thread because they pushed
a Move Toward A Thread Event. Without that
nudge the Scene might have involved the PC
questioning the thieves and moving the robbery
Thread along. With the nudge the robbery Thread
pivots and becomes linked to the main Thread of
solving the mystery of the missing people.

Make It Special
Maybe the problem isn’t getting to the end of
an adventure, it’s making that end feel powerful.
You can give the end of your adventure more
weight by making it special.

In normal Context of this adventure, during
any other Scene, you might interpret this to
mean Brizas fires off an energy bolt. That’s a
standard attack for this NPC. But this Scene is the
conclusion and making it more dramatic is part of
the Context used for making interpretations.
With that Context in mind the Player may
interpret a Yes to mean Brizas unleashes his
most dramatic attack spell, The Agony Cries
Of A Thousand Souls. Normally you might only
have made this interpretation for such an all-out
attack if the Fate Question had come back with
Exceptional Yes. But this Scene isn’t a normal
Scene, it’s the apparent conclusion of a big
Thread. This encourages the Player to ramp up
their expectations.

This is more of an attitude than a rule.
When you know a Scene is heading toward the
completion of an important Thread, give it all
the emotional energy you can muster. Make
interpretations of Fate Questions more impactful,
have Characters act more dramatically, infuse the
Scene with as much energy as you can.
This is the end of the Thread, so you can take
your foot off the narrative brakes and let loose.

The regular Fate Chart is the default with
the Chaos Factor having the maximum
influence on answers.
» The Mid-Chaos Fate Chart tones it down,
cutting out the more extreme ranges of the
Chaos Factor’s influence.
» The Low-Chaos Fate Chart takes it
down another notch, giving the Chaos
Factor just the slightest influence on Fate
Question answers.
» Finally, there’s the No-Chaos Fate Chart,
where the Chaos Factor is removed entirely

You can find the tables on this page and the

The Chaos Factor has a big impact on the
answers to Fate Questions. The more extreme the
Chaos the greater the chances of answers skewing
toward a Yes or a No. Exceptional results are also
more common.
This simulates a Game Master speeding up

WHAT IS “A SESSION”
IN SOLO PLAY?
Many role-playing systems refer to a game
session as a unit of time with rules attached to
the completion of a session. For instance, maybe
experience points are distributed for each session
of play.
In traditional group role-play guided by a
Game Master sessions tend to include enough
time to accomplish a goal, making it a good unit
of measurement for Player Character progress.
Solo role-playing sessions, however, aren’t
always so neatly divvied up. Every solo Player may
have their own approach to how long they play.
Many like to play for short periods of time as one
of the strengths of solo is starting and stopping

whenever you like. In short, the concept of a
“session” doesn’t mean the same thing in solo play
as it does in cooperative play.

148

VARIATIONS

Player Character having achieved a significant
adventure goal then that should constitute a
session, at least in terms of what your chosen
RPG is looking for.
Probably the easiest way to determine when
such a goal has been reached is when you
complete a Thread, especially an important
Thread. If you finish a Thread that is less
important maybe only consider it the end of a
session if it’s been a while since you’ve completed
your last session. This way easily accomplished
Threads that are achieved in a Scene or two don’t
necessarily trigger a session and any benefits that
come with it.
I think tying session rewards to Thread
accomplishment is an easier and more elegant way
to decide the end of a session than keeping track
of how much time you’ve spent or how many
Scenes have passed. If you play your solo games
in a patchwork fashion, maybe doing a few Scenes
before you go to work, then playing for an hour
on the weekend, maybe finishing a couple of
Scenes late at night, then the sum total of all that
adventuring becomes a meaningful session when
your PC achieves a Thread goal without the need
for additional bookkeeping specifically to identify
the session end.

A PLATE OF FATE, HOLD THE CHAOS
Removing the Chaos Factor completely from Fate
Questions makes for a simple Fate Chart and
no Chaos Factor modifiers to a Fate Check. You
may want this if you want Fate Questions to only
respond to the Odds.
This is also a good option if you are using Fate
Questions to replace game mechanics in your
chosen RPG (see “Using Fate Questions To
Replace RPG Rules” on 28). In this case you
might use one Fate Chart or Fate Check Modifiers
Table for regular, narrative Fate Questions and
the No-Chaos variety for game mechanics
Questions like task resolution.
If you remove the Chaos Factor from Fate
Questions you will still need to keep track of
the Chaos Factor throughout your adventure.
It comes into play when testing Expected
Scenes and determining Random Events.
If you want to reduce the influence of a shifting
Chaos Factor from those processes as well
you can restrict the range that the Chaos
Factor can shift to. For instance, if you want
the Chaos Factor to have less influence on
Expected Scenes and Random Events you
could restrict the Chaos Factor to a range of
3-7. If you want it to have even less control
then restrict it to 4-6 or always leave it at 5.

CONTROL YOUR
ADVENTURES WITH
KEYED SCENES

So what is the best way for a solo Player to
decide what a session is when their chosen RPG
calls for it?
You might think that choosing a set number
of Scenes may be the way to go. For instance,
5 Scenes or 8 Scenes is a session. But just like
solo sessions vary in length so do Scenes making
it impossible to assume that 5 or 8 Scenes
encompasses the kind of goals one would expect
to complete in a session.
I think a better way to record the end
of a solo session is to look at meaning and
accomplishment. If you end a Scene with your

A Mythic adventure can go just about
anywhere. The combination of your decisions
and expectations plus Mythic’s random processes
makes for adventures full of surprises.
If you want to take more control over where
your adventure goes, however, you can create
narrative rules specific to your adventure using
Keyed Scenes.

149

VARIATIONS

A Keyed Scene is a special event that sets a tone
to a Scene. You can tailor Keyed Scenes to any
trope or concept that you want.
Keyed Scenes allow you to control your
adventure in some interesting ways. For instance,
Keyed Scenes could be used as another way to
inject theme elements into your adventure. It
can also be used to guarantee that certain things
happen that you want to happen.
Let’s say you’re running a campaign in a
zombie apocalypse. You’ve had some good
adventures in this setting, but you’re unhappy
with how infrequently your Player Character is
running into zombies. You want more zombie
action. You could use Keyed Scenes to insert
zombie encounters into your adventure by
following certain rules that you set up.
These rules are called Triggers and they decide
when a Keyed Scene Event happens.

KEYED SCENE: LET’S RUMBLE!

TRIGGER

A combat will happen in this Keyed Scene.
Roll for a Random Event to generate it with
an automatic Focus of Current Context, the
Context being that this Event is a fight.

KEYED SCENE: BOSS FIGHT

TRIGGER

After 15 Scenes if a final confrontation with
the villain has not taken place then a roll of
1-3 on a 1d10 means the confrontation takes
place in the next Scene. Make this roll at the
end of every Scene after the 15th Scene.

EVENT

This Keyed Scene is designed for an adventure
that is meant to lead up to a confrontation with
a main villain. You want plenty of time to get
your PC to that point, but you don’t want the
adventure to drag on too long before this final big
event. This Keyed Scene helps to make sure that
doesn’t happen.

Keyed Scene Trigger
The Trigger is what tells you when a Keyed
Scene Event occurs. With a zombie adventure the
Trigger might be three Scenes that pass without
any zombie attacks taking place. After the third
Scene ends without an encounter the Keyed Scene
Event is Triggered and the next Scene now must
contain the Keyed Scene Event, a zombie attack.
A Trigger can be just about anything. For a
dungeon delve maybe the Trigger is if you roll
a 6 on a 1d6 and the Keyed Scene Event is a
wandering monster encounter. For a superhero
trying to maintain control over their wild powers
the Trigger could be a total of 4 Scenes where
they use their powers at maximum and the Keyed
Scene Event is their powers suddenly raging out
of control. Maybe for an adventure that you are
trying to keep on a schedule your Trigger is one
hour of real time passing and the Keyed Scene
Event is an automatic Move Toward A Thread
Random Event.

Complete 2 Scenes in a row without a fight.

EVENT

You’re thirsting for an adventure with battle, this
Keyed Scene will make it happen.

The Keyed Scene features a climactic
confrontation with the main villain. Create a
Random Event around this confrontation.

You can think of the Keyed Scene Trigger
as a sort of If/Then computer statement. If X
happens then Y happens. The Trigger can even
be something compound. For instance, let’s say
in our superhero adventure you like the idea that
after four times of maxing out your powers your

150

VARIATIONS

Keyed Scene Event
A Keyed Scene Event is what you want to
happen in a Keyed Scene, like our zombie attack.
You can decide these Events ahead of time,
before you begin your adventure, or during the
adventure when they occur to you. If you’re doing a
traditional dungeon delve maybe your Keyed Scene
Event is encountering a wandering monster. Maybe
you’re playing a superhero game where your Player
Character goes out of control sometimes when they
use their power too much, so your Keyed Scene
Event is your PC losing control.

TRIGGER

Player Character is in danger of losing control,
but you want it to be unpredictable. You decide
to make the Trigger going four Scenes where you
max out your power and you roll 1-5 on a 1d10.
Once the conditions of a Trigger are met in one
Scene the Event will happen in the next Scene.

EVENT

The Player Character is overwhelmed by what
they experienced. They must find emotional
support, such as seeking help, renewing their
faith in humanity, or finding peace. They can’t
engage in anything horror related without
attempting to flee until they get this support.
Once support is found reduce the Count by 3.

Roll 1-2 on 1d10 each Scene.

Encounter a random wandering monster
in the next Scene. Generate a Random
Event to introduce the monster.

TRIGGER

EVENT

Count each Scene where the PC experiences
a horror. When the Count reaches 5 or more,
a roll of 1-3 on 1d10 Triggers the Event in the
next Scene. Any Scene where the PC receives
emotional support reduces the Count by 1.

Roll 1 on 1d10 each Scene.

EVENT

This is a collection of Keyed Scenes designed to
evoke a classic dungeon crawl atmosphere. These
three Keyed Scenes require a separate 1d10 roll for
each to test the Trigger at the end of each Scene.

Encounter a trap. Generate a Random
Event to describe the trap, with an
Event Focus of PC Negative.

TRIGGER

This is a Keyed Scene designed to emulate
your PC trying to hold on to their sanity in a
horror adventure. This is an example of a more
complicated Keyed Scene.

Roll 1 on 1d10 each Scene.

EVENT

KEYED SCENE: SET DUNGEON TONE

TRIGGER

KEYED SCENE: THE HORROR

Encounter a strange puzzle to figure out.
Roll on the Descriptions Meaning Tables to
describe what it looks like, the Actions Meaning
Tables for what has to be done to solve it,
and roll again on the Actions Meaning Tables
once it’s been solved to see what happens.

When a Keyed Scene Event is Triggered it
becomes a necessary part of the next Scene. You
set up the Scene as normal, whether the Scene
is Expected, Altered, or an Interrupt, but also
include the Keyed Scene Event. With our zombie

151

VARIATIONS

apocalypse survivor you might have your idea for
the Expected Scene but you know that this Scene
is also a Keyed Scene and a zombie attack has to
take place in it, so you work that all together to
make the Scene.
The Keyed Scene Event should take place at
the beginning of the Scene, or as close to the
beginning as makes sense.

KEYED SCENE SURPRISE
Checking for Keyed Scenes as part of end of
Scene Bookkeeping is meant to keep things
simple. If a Keyed Scene Event is Triggered, you
work it into the start of the next Scene.
However, if you’d like to start the next Scene
without knowing if the Keyed Scene was Triggered
or not you could hold off on checking for the
Trigger until you have started the new Scene. This
really only makes sense with random Triggers,
such as “Roll a 1-3 on a 1d10”, but it gives your
Keyed Scenes Events more of a surprise element.

Playing Keyed Scenes
The first step to utilizing a Keyed Scene is
deciding what you want to use it for (sidebars in
this section explore some Keyed Scene examples).
These are the Keyed Scene Events that you want
to happen in your adventure. Next you need to
decide the Trigger.
When the Trigger is achieved in one Scene the
Keyed Scene Event happens in the next Scene.

For instance, with our zombie apocalypse
survivor, the Trigger for a zombie attack Event
may have been worded like “After 3 Scenes
without an attack roll 1-5 on a 1d10”. As the third
Scene in a row without an attack ends, the Player
holds off on making the d10 roll for the Trigger.
They start a new Scene as normal, and then early
into the Scene they make the roll. This way they
start the Scene without knowing if the Keyed
Scene Event will happen or not.

The zombie apocalypse Player Character has
been digging around in a ruined city looking for
shelter and supplies. She previously ran into a
hostile group so she’s been keeping a low profile.
The PC has gone through three Scenes where
she’s scavenging and hiding and hasn’t run into
any zombies. This is the Keyed Scene Trigger
so the Player knows the next Scene will have a
zombie encounter.
In the Scene where the Trigger happens the
Player Character escaped from the hostile
group who chased her through a wrecked office
building. The next Scene is the PC returning to
her shelter, a s fortified school classroom.
Since the Player knows that a zombie encounter
is going to happen she combines that with the
Expected Scene. As she returns to her shelter
she’s dismayed to find zombies outside the door,
blocking her.
You can use the Keyed Scenes Record Sheet on
the next page to keep track of your Keyed Scenes.

Delaying checking the Trigger gives you one more
thing to think about while you play, which is a
disadvantage. However, not only does it make
the Keyed Scene Event more of a surprise but
it allows you to pick the most dramatic moment
when it should happen, if it happens.

USING RANDOM EVENTS
Keyed Scene Events are usually going to be
an idea or concept. Such as “zombie encounter”,
“ship malfunctions”, “plot moves forward”, etc.
When the Keyed Scene Trigger happens you
know its Event will take place in the next Scene,
but you don’t know exactly how it’s going to
unfold. To help shape how it happens you can turn
the Keyed Scene Event into a Random Event with
an automatic Event Focus of Current Context.

a Random Event near the start of the Scene to
help explain the Keyed Scene Event. There’s

COUNTS
One way to formulate a Trigger is to create a
Count for it. After a certain number of things
happen the Keyed Scene Event is Triggered.
Counts can be anything, such as: how many
combats you’ve engaged in, how many Scenes
have passed without progress, how many clues
your PC has discovered, etc.
Record the Count each time the relevant
element happens to determine when the Trigger
is fulfilled.

RANDOMIZERS
Your Triggers don’t have to be absolute. If
you want an adventure with lots of combat you
could set a Trigger for a fight to occur on every
third Scene. This guarantees a certain amount of
combat in your adventure but maybe you think
this is too predictable. You can toss a randomizer
into the Trigger.
Instead of saying a combat happens after every
third Scene you could say the Trigger is “A result
of 1-3 on 1d10.” In the long run this would pan
out to happen roughly every three Scenes but you
wouldn’t know for sure when.

KEYED SCENE FREQUENCY
It’s your choice how often a Keyed Scene Event
can be Triggered in your adventure. Maybe it’s
a one time thing, maybe it can happen over and
over. You can work frequency conditions into the
Trigger. For instance, your Trigger may state that
the Keyed Scene Event is activated when a Count
reaches 5. Once it reaches 5 the Keyed Scene Event
is Triggered and the Count is reduced to 2 and can
be increased to Trigger the Event again.

happen. For instance, your fantasy warrior may
be trying to restore a mystical spring to bring
vitality back to a kingdom but you really want to
run into some kind of magical dilemma in this
adventure too. You make a Keyed Scene Event of
“Encounter a magical dilemma.” For the Trigger,
you set “Roll 1-3 on a 1d10 every Scene after
Scene 5. This Event will only happen once.”
Let’s say in Scene 3 your warrior runs afoul of
some kind of magical dilemma through a regular
Random Event in Mythic. While exploring a cave
system near the mystic spring the PC encounters
a naturally occurring magical phenomenon where
he is attacked by a construct composed of his
worst fears.
Your Keyed Scene is no longer relevant because
what you wanted to happen as the Keyed Scene
Event, encountering a magical dilemma, has
already happened in the normal course of your
adventure. When you run up against the Trigger
for this Event you may decide that the Keyed
Scene Event has already happened so it is done.

Keyed Scenes are a way to make sure you get the
adventure you want while still being surprised
by where Mythic takes you. There are numerous
ways you can modify Mythic to meet your needs:
FATE QUESTIONS: Choosing which Questions to
ask is the simplest way to guide your adventure
without taking too heavy control of it.
CHOOSING THE EVENT FOCUS: This is nearly
direct narrative control of your adventure. When
used sparingly it can keep an adventure on track.
LISTS: The elements you place on your Lists
impact the kind of Random Events you have.
Choosing your List elements carefully is a good
way to craft the possibilities of what can happen.
THE FIRST SCENE: There are various ways you
can decide what the first Scene is, including
coming up with it entirely yourself. Having this
much control over the start of your adventure can
set the tone for everything that comes after.
THREAD PROGRESS TRACK: Put an important
Thread front and center with the Track making
sure you complete it.
CHOOSE YOUR CHAOS FLAVOR: You can
reduce the impact of the Chaos Factor on your
Fate Questions by selecting mid-, low-, and noChaos alternatives.

GENERATING NEW
KEYED SCENES

KEYED SCENES: Create rules for your adventure
to make things happen that you want to happen.

You can come up with Keyed Scenes before
your adventure as a way of making sure you get
the elements you want. You can also add new
Keyed Scenes to your adventure as you play.
You might have a Mythic adventure about
an interesting planetary exploration where your
starship crew has found a world with ancient alien
ruins on it. As your PC explores you get an idea
that you would like your Character to encounter
a strange relic. You think that would be a cool
twist to the adventure and you want to increase
the likelihood of it happening. You make a Keyed
Scene Event of “Find a strange alien relic that has

odd, active properties.” The Trigger is “Roll 1 on
a 1d10. This Keyed Scene will only happen once.”
Now you’ve introduced the possibility of having
a Scene where you discover an active alien relic.
You set the Trigger so that it isn’t very likely to
happen in any given Scene, and may not happen at
all before the adventure is over, but it’s there as an
added possibility for any upcoming Scene.

USING MYTHIC
WITH PREPARED
ADVENTURES
The Mythic Game Master Emulator is built to
create adventures spontaneously as you play but it
can also be used with published adventures that are
meant for group play guided by a Game Master.
Some adjustments have to be made in both how
you normally play Mythic and how you would use

a prepared adventure. I think Mythic should take
a step back from providing structure and detail
allowing the published adventure to do that. After
all, you got the published adventure because it
looked interesting. You want to preserve the details
and atmosphere of the adventure as much as
possible in solo play.
Mythic retains its role as the arbiter of
events and the answerer of Questions while the
published adventure keeps its role as the provider
of structure and detail.

Being a solo role-player doesn’t lock you out of all those wonderful prepared adventures. With a few simple adjustments you can play in those adventures
with all the surprises and GM emulation that Mythic brings.

VARIATIONS

SCALING A PREPARED
ADVENTURE

Scaling
Most published adventures are designed
for groups but there’s a good chance you’ll be
going through it with a single Player Character.
Something needs to be done to ensure your PC
isn’t overwhelmed.
One option is to come up with more
Characters to control until you meet the
suggested requirements of the adventure, but
this is cumbersome and might detract from the
singular experience you want to have. Another
option is to include NPCs who accompany your
Player Character, but again we get into having to
do more bookkeeping than we may want.
If you’re having a single Player Character go
through a published adventure meant for a group
I suggest scaling the adventure down.

USE A SIMPLE VALUE
Roughly determine the power level of your
Player Character and compare that to what the
prepared adventure suggests using. Let’s say the
adventure is meant for 4-6 Characters of level 3-5
for a particularly popular fantasy RPG. Maybe
you have a Player Character ready to go who is
level 8. You figure that Character is about a 1/3rd
as powerful as the total group specifications.
That gives you a Diminisher Value of 1/3
which can now be applied to the challenges of
the prepared adventure as you encounter them to
bring them down to scale to your Player Character.
Apply the Diminisher Value to every situation
in the adventure that poses a challenge to the PC.
For encounters and battles with NPCs use the
Diminisher Value to either reduce the number
of NPCs encountered or the relevant statistics
of the individual NPCs. For instance, if an
encounter is with 6 monsters and you are going
with a Diminisher Value of 1/3 then reduce the
encounter down to 2 since 2 is one-third of 6. Or,
instead of reducing the quantity of the encounters
you reduce their individual power instead. The

157

VARIATIONS

NPCs cause 1/3rd as much damage, have a 1/3rd
as many hit points, etc.
You can reduce other hazards in the adventure
in a similar way. A pit trap causes 1/3rd as much
damage, for instance. If a danger isn’t so easily
calculated then reduce it by whatever amount feels
in line with the Diminisher Value you selected
such as lower poison potency, an easier target
number to resist, etc.
Not every value will divide evenly so you’ll have
to round your figures. Not all statistics in an RPG
lend themselves to simply being divided down.
The Diminisher Value is a benchmark to help you
make ballpark adjustments as you play. This keeps
it simple so you can make adjustments quickly.
If you encounter a monster with 70 hit points
in an adventure with a Diminisher Value of 1/3
you might decide the creature has 23 hit points.
The original monster does 2d12 damage with
a successful hit, so you scale that down to 1d8.
It can do 2 attacks per round, so you scale that
down to 1 attack per round.

DETERMINING POWER LEVELS
The advice for adjusting scaling requires you to
determine the capability of your Player Character
compared to a group of Characters and to the
adventure and defining it as a simple value to
use as a Diminisher. It’s impossible to make these
adjustments perfectly so you will have to do some
rough estimating.
The important thing is to get an idea of how
your single Player Character stacks up against
the group that is expected to go through this
adventure and translate that into a Diminisher
Value. Is it 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 1/5? Once you decide
on the value that feels right apply it to all the
challenges you encounter in the adventure, scaling
those dangers to match your Player Character.
Applying the Diminisher Value usually requires
rough estimating. Applying a diminisher of 1/3 to
a monster with 60 hit points is easy. You get 20.
What if your chosen RPG uses a value for creature
defense that isn’t a simple, divisible number like
that? In that case you would have to estimate how
to change the statistic based on the spirit of what
1/3rd might look like.

Getting Started
Once you have a Diminisher Value in mind
and are ready to start the prepared adventure,
read through the introductory sections. Some
surprises may be spoiled by reading this material
but that’s okay. This approach to playing prepared
adventures solo isn’t going to be exactly like a
regular group experience, and it won’t be like a
normal solo experience either. It’s a combination
of both.
You are going to know things about the
adventure that your Player Character does not,
and you’ll have to sometimes play as though your
Character does not know what you know. (See
“Resolving Character vs. Player Knowledge” for
tips on how to handle this).
Still, read as little as possible so that you
preserve as much surprise as you can.

The Diminisher Value is a rule of thumb to help
you make these estimates as you play.

LISTS
As you read the introductory sections make
sure you have your Threads and Characters Lists
handy. Write down any Threads or Characters
you read about that seem important. With a
prepared adventure you are populating the Lists
with elements that are revealed to you before you
begin playing. This helps prime Mythic to set the
tone and atmosphere.

Adventure Features
Using Mythic with prepared adventures
introduces a new List: Adventure Features.

158

VARIATIONS

Player puts all of these items into the Adventure
Features List as possible things that could happen
in a Random Event.

ONE DETAIL AT A TIME

Elements that appear in the Adventure Features
List may also appear again in the other Lists,
especially the Characters List. “Vampire Lord
attacks” may be in your Adventure Features List,
and “Vampire Lord” may be in your Characters
List, for instance.
Adventure Features is one way to link Mythic
with the tone of the prepared adventure. If you’re
playing a fantasy Character in a jungle town
looking for a guide it may be common in the
adventure for guides to seek explorers out. You
might add “Guide finds you” to the Adventure
Features List for this reason.
There is a special Prepared Adventure Event
Focus Table that includes Adventure Features
you’ll find on the following pages. You’ll also find
a copy of the Adventure Features List Sheet on the
next page.

Maybe the best way to describe running through
a prepared adventure going solo with Mythic is
approaching it as one detail at a time. You are
going to know more than your Player Character
does, that’s inevitable. However, no matter how
much you know about the adventure your PC is
still only going to encounter everything one detail
at a time.
Keeping this in mind makes the prepared
adventure manageable and also allows for
surprises.
For instance, you might be exploring a vast
dungeon that fills 125 pages in a large published
adventure. Despite all that content, your PC is
only experiencing one room at a time and one
detail in that room at a time. You are still building
your adventure element by element, just like any
other solo Mythic adventure. The only difference
here is that whereas a standard Mythic adventure
gets all its details from your expectations and
Mythic prompts, this one has a third source: the
prepared adventure text.

Scenes

Approaching it one detail at a time also allows
for surprises because some of those details may
change as you play. While our intention is not to
deviate from the prepared adventure too much,
some deviation will likely still take place. This
means that all of those details are uncertain until
your Player Character encounters them and they
become part of the Context of your adventure.
Until then they are just potential.

Most prepared adventures provide a starting
point for Player Characters. You can use this to
fashion the first Scene, basically taking it as an
Inspired Idea approach.
Play out the Scene in the normal Mythic way,
asking Fate Questions when you need to, going to
Meaning Tables to Discover Meaning when you
require more detail, and resolving Random Events.
All the Scenes in your adventure are played this
way, just as they are with a normal solo Mythic
adventure but also drawing from the content of
the prepared adventure.

Alongside Threads and Characters keep track of
Adventure Features, which is anything special or
unique that is part of this prepared adventure that
could form an encounter as you play.

GETTING CONTEXT
AND CONTENT

A published adventure about hunting a vampire
lord includes wandering monster tables, a list of
random visions that the Player Character may
sometimes receive, and the sudden appearance
of the vampire in hit and run attacks. The

Use the details in the prepared adventure to
help form Context, reading only as much text as
you have to when you have to.

End a Scene when it feels natural, just as you
would with a regular Mythic adventure. In the
example above, the Player Character may wander
about the village for a while, learning about it
and encountering some of its citizens. There is an
important encounter with the mayor of the village.
The prepared adventure says the mayor will
beseech the Player Characters into helping fight
the vampire lord. The Player decides after this
encounter is a good spot to end the Scene.
Finding the right place to end a Scene while
playing through a prepared adventure may not
feel right at first. In a standard Mythic game a
Scene will play itself out. You’re either looking for
the main focus of the Scene to conclude or one of
the other end of Scene strategies chosen from the
“Scenes” chapter. You have a tactic for when to
end a Scene.
With a prepared adventure, you may be moving
from one location and encounter in the text
to another. Each of those encounters may feel
distinct, causing you to wonder if this should be
considered a Scene.

The Player uses the map to determine where

As stated earlier, this style of play of merging
Mythic with a prepared adventure requires that

Scene idea. You can base this on what you know
of the adventure and what happened in the
previous Scene.
The Expected Scene is likely going to be one of
two things:
» Picking up from the activity of the previous
Scene.
» Continuing on to something new.

I suggest still going with a Scene end strategy,
just like you would with a regular Mythic
adventure. Make the prepared adventure content
fit into that strategy.

STARTING A NEW SCENE
Start a new Scene like you normally would
with Mythic by coming up with an Expected

This adventure included an interesting Scene where the Player Character bet on a boxing match between two droids. In this section of the prepared
adventure the boxing match is a way for the PC to meet the green droid after the bout. Watching the boxing match was an opportunity to see what
this potential new ally could do. The Player decides that the end of the fight is a good place to end the Scene, with the next Scene being about
meeting the droid afterward.

161

VARIATIONS

ENDING WITH ACTION
The Player’s end of Scene strategy is “Interest”
in a solo Mythic adventure through a prepared
module about the exploration of an ancient
jungle temple.
A Scene starts with the Player Character entering
the underground temple. The PC moves along
the main hall, finding an inscription in the wall.
They read it, gaining some clues about what lies
ahead, and move on. They enter a room full of
vine strewn statues. Inside the room, within a
secret compartment at the base of a statue, they
find a key. Moving on from the room and back
into the hall, the PC continues forward until they
have a surprise encounter with a wandering
monster. This results in a brief battle where the
PC dispatches the creature.
The Player decides to end the Scene here. All
of those events were part of one Scene, but it
didn’t feel right to end the Scene until the battle
encounter. The previous encounters, such as
finding the inscription on the wall and locating
the hidden key, just didn’t strike the Player as
interesting enough to be the end of the Scene.
However, the fight was the first bit of real action
in the adventure. That, coupled with the previous
events, felt like a good place to end the Scene.

For instance, in the earlier example about the
vampire hunt adventure the Player ended the
Scene after encountering the mayor. Based on
that, the idea for the next Expected Scene could
be “Meet with the Mayor at her office to find out
what’s going on.”
On the other hand, you may have no idea
what to expect next from the adventure. In that
case the Expected Scene could be as simple as
“Continue on.” For instance, in the example about
the jungle temple adventure, the Player ended the
Scene after a fight in the hall. The Player has no
idea what’s coming next so the Expected Scene is
simply, “Continue down the hall.”

TESTING THE SCENE
We want to stick as much as possible to
the prepared adventure, Mythic is not here to
overtake the adventure but to tweak it as we go.
Mythic is more of a co-GM with the prepared
adventure having priority.
With that in mind we won’t be using Altered or
Interrupt Scenes when playing through a prepared
adventure. Instead test the Expected Scene to see
if a Random Event happens.
If you roll within the Chaos Factor when
testing the Expected Scene generate a Random
Event. Since your Lists are being filled with
Threads and Characters your Player Character
has encountered and that were added at the start
the Random Event will have the flavor of the
prepared adventure.
This Random Event is different than one you
would generate for an Interrupt Scene. With an
Interrupt, the Random Event becomes the central
focus of the Scene, replacing the Expected Scene.
Here we’re keeping the Expected Scene and
adding the Random Event to it as extra content.
The Random Event won’t dramatically change
the course of the adventure like an Interrupt
could, it’s more like when a Game Master has
a good idea in the middle of an adventure and
decides to spring it on the Player Characters.
You can decide to have the Random Event
take place at the beginning of the Scene or a little
further in if it seems more appropriate.
Our fantasy warrior exploring the vampire’s
castle has found the stairs to the catacombs. The
Player decided to end the Scene there, so the next
Expected Scene became “Descend the stairs into
the catacomb.”
When testing this Expected Scene the Player rolls
within the Chaos Factor. In normal Mythic play
this would call for an Altered or Interrupt Scene
but the Player instead makes it a Random Event
for the Expected Scene.

162

VARIATIONS

Rolling on the Focus and Meaning Tables,
the Player gets PC Negative, and “Decrease”
and “Freedom”. The Player decides this means
that winds that the PC has been experiencing
throughout the castle are much stronger in the
stairwell, making it difficult to maintain his
torch and visibility. He’s going to have to proceed
more carefully in the catacombs since he can’t see
as well in the flickering light.

LITTLE CHANGES
The approach outlined here for playing in
prepared adventures using Mythic tries to take
a soft approach, altering as little about the
adventure as possible. However, Mythic will
introduce little, detailed changes as you play.
Fate Questions might alter how an encounter is
supposed to take place, Random Events during
a Scene may introduce new elements or shift
existing elements around, and testing the Scene
and generating a Random Event introduces even
more changes.

If the Player had instead rolled NPC Action
and “Communicate” and “Danger”, and if the
NPC rolled on the Characters List had been
Brookfield, a human servant of the vampire, the
Player may have interpreted it this way: as the PC
descends into the catacombs and explores they
come across Brookfield (an NPC already defined
in the prepared adventure as a possible wandering
encounter), who will try to talk the PC into
fleeing from the castle.
Both of these Random Events added a surprise
without breaking the prepared adventure.

Each individual change is fairly small. If it requires
you to change the prepared adventure that
alteration will probably be easy to do. The further
you go into the adventure, the more these
changes add up. This leads to an experience
that is true to how the author of the adventure
intended, but with narrative elements that you
could not predict even if you had read the entire
adventure cover to cover.
When a change contradicts what’s written in
the adventure, give priority to the change. The
contents of the prepared adventure are all
potential details until they happen in the game,
which means any of them can be changed if the
unfolding adventure demands it. Once something
happens in the adventure, whether it’s as written
or is the result of a Mythic prompt, then it
becomes solid Context.

Encounters And Locations
Prepared adventures provide a collection of
places and encounters for Player Characters to
interact with. Just like with the beginning of the
adventure, only read as much of each encounter
as you have to when the encounter begins. Read
to understand what the PC is experiencing, then
decide what they do. After this, read further
to understand what consequences the Player
Character’s actions may have.
There will likely be some spoilers with this
approach, but that’s okay. We are separating
Player knowledge from Character knowledge as
much as we can, and the goal is to experience the
flavor of the adventure even if that means getting
clued in on some of the surprises.

and carefully open the coffins. After deciding this
the Player reads on and discovers that one coffin
has a wight in it that will attack if disturbed.
There is also a pressure plate on the floor that
if stepped on will alert the wight who will then
spring out of the coffin and attack.
The prepared adventure provides rules for how
to decide if the Player Character steps on the
pressure plate so the Player follows through to
see if his Character did. The Player already

and begins to explore, they come across a dusty

VARIATIONS

knows the Character is opening both coffins so an
encounter with the wight is inevitable.

PREPARED ADVENTURE
EVENT FOCUS TABLE

If at any point in the process of adjudicating
an encounter you aren’t sure what should happen
you can always pose it as a Fate Question. For
instance, maybe the pressure plate is triggered
if you walk to one of the coffins first. Since the
Player isn’t sure which coffin the PC approached
first they might pose it as a Fate Question, “Did
he step on the plate?”
Encounters in a prepared adventure are
resolved liked this with a combination of
reading as much as you have to, deciding what
to do, reading more, then navigating how it all
unfolds using your judgement and Mythic to
guide you.

Random Events
When rolling for Random Events use the
Prepared Adventure Focus Table instead of the
regular Event Focus Table. This version removes
the entries for Remote Event, New NPC, Move
Toward A Thread, Move Away From A Thread,
Close A Thread, and Ambiguous Event. You don’t
need Mythic to produce these events for you since
the prepared adventure already does it.
What remains is NPC Action, NPC
Negative, NPC Positive, PC Negative, PC
Positive, and Current Context. These are all
results that use elements from the prepared
adventure, allowing you to present those
elements in Random Events that don’t break the
overall adventure as presented.
There is one more result possible on that table:
Adventure Feature, which was discussed earlier.
Adventure Features are elements that are unique
to the prepared adventure.
If you roll Adventure Feature as a Random
Event you may not have to roll on the Event
Meaning Tables for further clarification if it’s
not necessary. For instance, maybe the prepared
adventure is about modern espionage where the

Player Character is a spy who has been poisoned
and must work to find the antidote before she
dies. The prepared adventure may include a
special mechanic to determine the advancement
of the poison where the Gamemaster determines
after some time that the PC gets worse along a
pre-determined scale.
This could be represented as an element in
the Adventure Features List, “Poison gets worse.”
Getting that result for a Random Event may
not require any rolls on the Meaning Tables
for clarification because it’s a straightforward
mechanic to track the poison.
If the Adventure Feature rolled was
“Wandering monster”, requiring you to roll on a
wandering monster table, you may still want to
roll on the Meaning Tables to get a clue as to how
the monster approaches or what they do.
Given the wide variety of possibilities with
Adventure Features, use your judgement in how
one translates into a Random Event.

COMPLICATED
CAMPAIGNS
Growing a solo adventure into a full fledged
campaign is a magical experience. From what
likely started as humble beginnings with a Player
Character and a few ideas has grown into a full
dynamic world with ever-growing lore.
However, an ongoing series of adventures poses
unique challenges the further you get.
Ragnor the Rogue’s life was simple when you

and stay out of the city jail. Eight adventures

forgotten who some of them are.

bumped into at the nightclub might show up as a
vampire clinging to the wall of your apartment.
Pruning your Lists is still a good tactic with
complicated adventures but using the “I Dunno
Rule” can help simplify the process.
The “I Dunno Rule” recognizes that Mythic
provides lots of prompts to spur your imagination
but its randomness also means that sometimes it
will give prompts that don’t work for you. If you
can’t interpret a Mythic prompt quickly, whether
it’s an answer to a Fate Question or a Random
Event result, then consider saying “I don’t know”
drop it and move on.
Difficult to interpret Random Events can
become an issue in a complicated adventure
campaign, especially one with a fully loaded

Threads and Characters Lists bursting at
the seams is probably the most obvious and
immediate problem with adventure campaigns
that are complicated because they’ve gone on for
so long.

List Editing With I Dunno Rule
The end of each Scene is the time to add
and remove elements from your Characters and
Threads Lists. The simplest way to manage
a List that’s thick with elements is to remove
the Characters and Threads that are no longer
relevant to your adventure.
However, editing your Lists can get tougher the
more complex your adventure gets.
Maybe you want your adventure to have a lot
going on. You might add all kinds of NPCs and
Threads to your Lists to include all the content you
can. You never know when that taxi driver may
turn out to be a secret enemy or that woman you

You may like to place lots of NPCs on your Characters List, even if

adding monsters and other oddities. Finally, now
that you’re in the Chittering Woods you made
contact with a community of forest fairies which
you’ve added to the Characters List.
So what does this have to do with the “I
Dunno Rule”? It’s this: if you are hesitant to cut
down your List because every element on it, no
matter how remote it may seem now, feels like it
still has potential you can let the “I Dunno Rule”
be the arbiter on whether an element stays or goes.
Instead of deciding at the end of a Scene if an
element should be cut from the List wait until
you are required to roll on the List. If you roll
a List element that causes you to invoke the “I
Dunno Rule” then that’s a sign that the element
should be cut.
This creates a rule around when to remove
elements from a List instead of you deciding
when they are no longer relevant. Now it’s Mythic
deciding when they are no longer relevant. Those
elements get to stay on their List as long as they
want, but as soon as they get called upon and you
have no idea what to do with them then they get
crossed out.

Adventure Cohesion
Maybe your adventure has gone on so long that
there are lots of Threads going on. There could be
many crucial NPCs whose actions are important
to your adventure. These Threads and Characters
elements should all combine to craft the narrative
of your game.
I’m calling this adventure “cohesion” because
your ongoing campaign should feel like a
unified whole, all the parts working together. A
complicated adventure or series of adventures may
have so many active elements that it can start to
feel fractured, losing cohesion to the point where
you aren’t sure what is going on or where the
narrative is heading.
Here are some ideas to keep your adventure all
nicely glued together.

Characters List. Maybe your Player Character
started in the Kingdom of Halvand, then spent
time at the Court Of King Deneral, engaged in
dungeon delving in the Tomb Of Antherat, and
is now on an adventure exploring the Chittering
Woods.
That’s a lot of ground your Player Character has
covered. Your Characters List would have people
you met from Halvand in it, probably the first
NPCs you encountered. A few adventures later
things got more interesting as you rubbed elbows
with royalty, now you have a prince, a king, and a
bunch of royal family members on the List. The
trip through the dungeon really expanded the List,

START FRESH
Usually a Mythic Player ends an adventure
when a main Thread has been resolved. You
wrap up the adventure and then consider starting
a new one, bringing over the Threads and
Characters you want if you plan to build on the
previous adventure.
While you can end an adventure when you feel
it’s reached a culminating moment you can also
end it whenever you want. It could be when you
are right in the middle of a big battle, or dealing
with a mystery, or when you haven’t solved any
Threads at all.
Ending an adventure and starting over with
a new one is one way to help regain a sense of
cohesion to a complicated campaign.
Think about the first Scene in a Mythic
adventure. That opening Scene is unique. It
isn’t influenced by the Chaos Factor. While
it can be constructed like an Interrupt with a
Random Event it doesn’t have to be. The first
Scene can be anything you want it to be. You
have more narrative and creative control over
the first Scene than you do any other Scene in
an adventure.
So let’s use that to refocus an adventure that
has gotten lost.
Ragnor the Rogue’s time in the Chittering Woods
has gotten interesting. After befriending the
fairies by name-dropping Prince Toymin, Ragnor
has undertaken to help the fairy community
reclaim a long lost magical crown taken by a
group of criminal outcasts.
In the process of fulfilling this quest Ragnor
encounters the outcasts, and finds them to be a
peaceful group who are on the run from their
brethren. It turns out that Prince Toymin
didn’t so much declare a portion of the forest to
be protected as he declared war on a segment
of fairy society that were unpopular with the
majority. When fleeing their homes the outcast

PRUNING SEASON
Earlier, editing Lists was discussed to keep them
focused and under control. That advice goes
along very well with starting over.
Ending an adventure and continuing with a
new one already involves List pruning. If one
adventure is a continuation of the previous you
are going to pull over Threads and NPCs, making
choices about what to keep and what to drop.
If you find yourself having to do an extensive edit
of a List you may want to take this as a sign that
it’s time to end the adventure and start a new
one. You can use this as an opportunity to review
your ongoing adventure, helping to ensure it
makes sense and stays manageable.

leader took the crown with him to use its power
to help his people survive.
Now Ragnor’s Player is conflicted about
where to go with this adventure. Does Ragnor
make good on his offer to help the forest fairies?
Does he switch sides, throwing off the previous
course of this adventure toward a new direction?
What about Ragnor’s association with the royal
family? Is he about to burn an important bridge
for himself?
The adventure has just gotten complicated.
The Player could continue the adventure,
creating Expected Scenes and going from there
to see what happens. Or they can consider the
adventure is over and start a new one. The Player
can review and edit the Lists and decide what the
starting Scene should be that would help refocus
the adventure narrative.
The Player decides to refocus the adventure by
ending it and starting a new one. To clean up
the campaign narrative, the Player decides that
the new adventure takes place a month later
after Ragnor switched sides to help the outcasts.
He is now camping with them in the forest,
helping them evade patrols searching for them.

VARIATIONS

MULTIPLE LISTS

WHICH LIST TO USE

Multiple Lists are a good way to keep a
complicated adventure organized and help
maintain cohesion. It could work like this:
you have your Lists for an ongoing adventure
that has gotten quite complicated with various
communities of NPCs and lots of Player
Character goals. The geography of your adventure
takes place in several separate areas that your PC
commonly travels through. To make it even more
complicated you’ve decided to add a second PC
to the adventure that has nothing to do with your
other Player Character, you just thought it would
be interesting.
By using multiple Lists your Lists may look
something like this:
» A Threads List for your first PC.
» A Threads List for your second PC.
» A Characters List for your first PC in the
region they primarily roam.
» Another Characters List for your first PC
for a distant region they sometimes visit.
» A Characters List for your second PC.
That’s a total of five Lists for a single adventure.
Each List has a different focus depending on
which PC we are dealing with or which geographic
region the Character is in at the time.
Maintaining multiple Lists is a way to
categorize the elements of a complicated
adventure into meaningful chunks. This makes it
more likely that you will get results for Random
Events and Interrupts that make sense with where
your narrative is physically currently at, helping to
maintain adventure cohesion.

When playing with multiple Lists, when to use one
List or another is up to you. If the circumstances
of your adventure seem to indicate a particular
List then use it.
When you separate a List into multiple Lists
they don’t have to be broken down just by
geography. Anything that helps divide List
elements can be used. While geographic
locations are easy to identify you could also
use themes if your adventure has various tones
(action, personal drama, etc.), areas of Player
Character interest, or just about anything that
pertains to your adventure.
When you decide that a particular List is active
for a Scene, that is the List you will edit during the
end of Scene Bookkeeping.

This has created a situation where you
essentially have two adventures going on at the
same time: what goes on in the city and what
happens in the dungeon.
You might decide to break your Lists into ones
that pertain to the city and the dungeon. You pull
all the dungeon related NPCs off the original List
and place them on the new dungeon Characters
List. There may be a few Threads that are
dungeon related so you make a separate dungeon
Threads List. You use the city Lists when the
adventure takes place in the city and the dungeon
Lists when your PC is exploring there.
The Lists don’t have to be mutually exclusive,
you can have the same elements on both Lists.
For instance, maybe the Player has a Thread of
“Find the Eye of Yeehon,” a mystical artifact that
is fabled to be hidden in the dungeon. This is why
your Character spends so much time adventuring
in there. However, the Thread also applies to the
city. There is plenty of lore to be learned about the
Eye that can be gleaned from experts in town. It
makes sense to have that Thread be on both Lists.

WHAT TO PUT ON A LIST
If you decide to create multiple Lists decide
what the new List and the old List are for. Maybe
your fantasy Character spends most of their
time near a city but they are also adventuring in
a nearby dungeon. The dungeon is an ongoing
element in your adventures with the Character
occasionally returning to it to explore further.

VARIATIONS

PERIL POINTS

AND THE STORY GOES ON

The adventuring life is perilous, and most
Player Characters need a helping hand sometimes.
In social, guided role-play that helping hand
comes from the Game Master. Often unknown
to the Players the GM may quietly divert your PC
from certain doom to keep the adventure going.
You can represent this saving hand in solo
role-playing using Peril Points. A Peril Point can
be spent at any time to change the narrative and
save your Player Character when your adventure is
about to end and you don’t want it to.

Peril Points is a blunt instrument to save an
adventure from an early end. There are other
ways to avert certain doom, such as asking
narrative building Fate Questions. (See “Narrative
Killing Questions” on page 83).
You can also build your Player Character’s survival
into the Context of your adventure. For instance,
you can decide ahead of time that your PC cannot
die. That’s part of the Context of your adventure.
If something happens that would result in their
death, it gets changed to something else.

Your Player Character is a young mage in
a game of modern, urban magic. They are
currently climbing up the side of a building at
night to try and stop a warlock from casting a
ritual that would take over the minds of everyone
in the city.

Mythic presents multiple ways to sustain an
adventure because there are a multitude of
solo play styles out there. If you are a narrative
style Player who loves the story and is okay with
manipulating it when you have to, then focusing
on asking narrative building Questions and using
Context to save your PC may be to your liking.

Your PC has a companion helping, a former
assistant to the warlock who now wants to help
you stop him. He has reached the roof first
when a Random Event indicates he turns on
your Character.

If you’re more of a simulationist Player, where you
love the excitement of knowing your choices can
lead to success or failure then saving yourself
with Context may feel too artificial. In this case, a
limited number of Peril Points could be used as an
emergency, but even those are in short supply.

The Player asks the Fate Question, “Does he cut
the rope?” and Mythic says Yes.
The Player has a problem now. The PC is thirty
floors above a city street, hanging from a rope
that is being cut. They have no way to avert
certain death from the fall.
The Player is using Peril Points with this game
and has 2 Points left in the pool. This is a good
time to spend one.
The Player interprets it this way: The rope is cut
and the Player Character falls about fifteen feet
before hitting the railing of a balcony. They grab
on to the railing desperately and are able to haul
themselves to the balcony.

While Supplies Last
Decide before you play how many Peril Points
your Player Character gets. This value is up to
you, the more Points the more chances you have
to change an outcome. A limited pool helps
maintain narrative tension since Peril Points
should only be used when necessary. A supply of 2
Peril Points is a good default.
When you use a Peril Point you can change the
narrative to prevent the adventure from ending.
For instance, if a monster just rolled the killing
blow for your Player Character you spend a Peril
Point and suddenly the bridge you’re standing on
breaks sending you tumbling to the river below
out of harm’s way instead.

170

VARIATIONS

Whether or not Peril Points get replenished is
also up to you. If you want Peril Points to help
make each game session more survivable, you may
reset them to their maximum supply at the start
of each adventure session. If, instead, you want to
use Peril Points to help get your PC started you
may give them a fixed number of Peril Points.
Once those are gone they are forever gone.

THE ADVENTURE CRAFTER
The Adventure
Crafter is a book
in the Crafter
Series from Word
Mill Games.
It’s a system
for randomly
generating a
narrative structure,
using common
fictional tropes
to assemble a
story outline. This
adventure outline can be used as inspiration for
making a fully fleshed out adventure scenario,
as an adventure seed generator for new
adventures, a background or history creator, or
just about anything where you want to randomly
create a layered narrative.

USING THE
ADVENTURE
CRAFTER WITH
MYTHIC
When The Adventure Crafter published in
2018 it offered a new way to generate random
adventures. I viewed it as an alternate version of
the Mythic Game Master Emulator, coming at the
same goal from another point of view.
The Adventure Crafter borrows many familiar
Mythic concepts, like Lists and breaking an
adventure down into structural components
(Turning Points instead of Mythic’s Scenes).
It also introduces new concepts and its own
approach for generating content. The two
systems work well together, and The Adventure
Crafter offers three pages of explanation on how
to merge them.
This section updates those rules while
making some changes and adding new concepts
to hopefully make the Mythic Game Master
Emulator and The Adventure Crafter play together
as nicely as possible.

The Adventure Crafter pairs nicely with Mythic in a
number of ways, from helping to make starting
Scenes to acting as a replacement for how
Interrupt Scenes are generated.

adventure that includes Plotlines (The Adventure
Crafter’s term for Threads) and NPCs.
Generating a single Turning Point with The
Adventure Crafter should be enough to give you
a detailed outline of a Scene. However, for the
First Scene, consider generating more than one
Turning Point if you want a more detailed Scene.
Creating two or three Turning Points can give
you a wealth of detail for your First Scene and
additional Plotlines and Characters to get you
started. You can think of this as analogous to a
published adventure module giving you a detailed
start to an adventure, with a history of events and
the circumstances that have brought your Player
Character into it.

The First Scene
Using The Adventure Crafter to generate the
opening Scene of a Mythic adventure is a natural.
It can create a detailed introduction to your

VARIATIONS

Altered and Interrupt Scenes
The Adventure Crafter suggests using Turning
Points to generate both Altered and Interrupt
Scenes. I am changing this advice to suggest only
using The Adventure Crafter to generate Interrupt
Scenes. To keep your adventure moving swiftly
Altered Scenes should follow Mythic’s rules.
You can generate an Interrupt using The
Adventure Crafter by creating a Turning Point
to replace the Random Event that Mythic
normally uses.
Mythic Interrupt Scenes often change the
direction of an adventure, sometimes in dramatic
ways. Using Turning Points as Interrupts increases
the chances of making big changes in the adventure
because more elements can come into play.

Lists

USING FEWER PLOT POINTS
Making a full Turning Point with The Adventure
Crafter isn’t as fast as generating a Random Event
in Mythic. A Turning Point is composed of 5 Plot
Points, and each Plot Point may involve Plotlines
and Characters. All of this has to be interpreted
into something meaningful.
If creating full Turning Points for Interrupt Scenes
is slowing your game down too much, consider
using fewer Plot Points. If 5 is too many, try 4 or
3. Even 1 or 2 Plot Points is enough to inspire a
meaningful Scene.

Threads and NPCs are removed at your
discretion during Scene Bookkeeping as you
would in a typical Mythic Adventure.
In a gritty sci-fi adventure game the Player just
generated an Interrupt Scene. They are playing
Mythic with The Adventure Crafter, so they use
a Turning Point to define this Interrupt.

I suggest using Mythic Game Master Emulator
Second Edition List rules instead of Adventure
Crafter Lists when combining the two systems
(this is a change from the advice given in Mythic
Magazine #5, to account for differences in Second
Edition rules). Adventure Crafter Plotlines and
Mythic Threads are the same thing, so whenever
The Adventure Crafter refers to Plotlines consider it
the same as Threads.
Using Mythic Adventure List Sheets, Threads
and NPCs are added to your Lists when they are
Invoked by an Adventure Crafter Turning Point.
You should add them to your List while Plot
Points are generated, instead of doing it after a
Scene in Bookkeeping, so later Plot Points in the
same Turning Point have a chance to Invoke them.
Edit your Lists as normal during end of Scene
Bookkeeping. Whether a Thread or NPC is part
of a Turning Point and was added to a List at
the beginning of the Scene, or was added later
because it appeared while playing out the Scene,
it still just gets added once to its List for the
Scene as normal.

Rolling for their Plot Points using Adventure
Crafter rules, one of the Plot Points generated
is “A Character Is Incapacitated”. The Player
determines that this Plot Point applies to a new
NPC being generated. The Player comes up with
“Zango Finley”, an aquatic mutant. The Player
writes this new NPC onto the Characters List and
continues to generate the rest of the Plot Points.
It turns out Zango is incapacitated because he
has been trapped in a watery cage by a group
of raiders who have been sacking villages up
and down the coast. They are using a machine
to siphon Zango’s powers and use the energy to
charge up their weapons.
The Scene proceeds with the Player Character
and her companions catching sight of the raiders’
caravan. Noticing the captive, they sneak
toward the group and are able to successfully
rescue Zango. The mission doesn’t go smoothly,

172

VARIATIONS

ROLLING ON A LIST

however, with a fight breaking out between the
Player Character and the raiders. Zango is able
to use his energy powers to help them all escape.

Rolling on Lists is handled differently when
a Plot Point Invokes a Thread or Character than
when a Mythic Random Event calls for rolling on
a List.
Normally in Mythic when a Random Event
requires a trip to a List, such as when you roll an
Event Focus of NPC Action, you check to see how
much of your List is filled then roll up to two dice
to determine which part of the List to roll on and
then what element in that part is selected.
When rolling on a List for a Plot Point, however,
roll on the full List regardless of the number
of elements in it. Roll 2d10 with the first d10
determining which section of the List to refer to
and the second d10 selecting a line in that section.
This means it’s far more likely to roll a blank
line when Invoking a Character or Thread
with a Plot Point than it is when rolling for a
Random Event. While Mythic Random Events
are meant to throw surprises at you, often using
an existing element in your adventure in a new
way, Adventure Crafter Turning Points are meant
to add new story twists to your adventure. These
Turning Points may have multiple elements to
interpret, with Plot Points framed as drama
tropes. With all this potential additional meaning
to make an interpretation out of you also get
additional control of the Lists to help make those
interpretations smoother.

During end of Scene Bookkeeping the Player
doesn’t add Zango to the Characters List again
because they already did at the beginning of the
Scene while generating the Turning Point.

CHOOSE TO ...
When rolling an empty line for a Mythic
Random Event you have the option to Choose. This
choice is either to select an element from the List
that you think fits the situation best or to roll again.
When rolling an empty line for an Invoked
element for a Plot Point, however, you have an
additional choice: Add a Thread or Character.
Choosing to add a Thread or a Character is the
same as when using The Adventure Crafter alone

173

VARIATIONS

and you roll an empty line on a List that says
“New Plotline” or “New Character”.
Threads in a Mythic adventure usually occur
organically as you play. You, the Player, decide
when you want something to be a new Player
Character objective.
However, since Turning Points often describe
a narrative event with multiple moving parts this
is a good opportunity to inject a new Thread into
your adventure.
The same applies to Characters. Maybe you
rolled up a Plot Point where it makes sense that a
new Character is now involved in the adventure.
If it seems appropriate then choose this to be a
new Character. Follow the regular Adventure
Crafter rules for creating a new NPC, generating
their Trait, Identity, and Descriptors.

THE ADVENTURE CRAFTER DECK
If you use The
Adventure Crafter Deck
instead of the book
you can combine
it with Mythic
by making a few
changes to the rules
presented here.
Instead of rolling on
a List for an Invoked
Thread or Character
you can draw a
card as normal and
use the number on the card next to Plotlines or
Characters. This will tell you which line on the List
to select. The Adventure Lists are numbered 1 to
25 on the right.

WHAT GOES ON THE
CHARACTERS LIST

If you get a blank line instead of choosing whether
to select an element on the List or to have a
new Thread or Character be created, you can let
the deck decide by going with the result printed
below “Plotlines” or “Characters”.

In normal Adventure Crafter rules every
Character goes on the Characters List, both Player
Characters and Non-Player Characters.
When combining the two systems, however,
only place Non-Player Characters on the List as
you normally would in a Mythic adventure.
If you Invoke a Character and roll on the
List and get a blank line, you have the option to
Choose a Character from the List for this Plot
Point. Even though your Player Character isn’t on
the List, you can still Choose them. This allows
you to include your Player Character in Plot
Points when it makes the most sense to do so.

The Player just wrapped up a Scene where the
Player Character has been posing as a cook in
the raider’s camp to learn more about the leader
and his plans. The next Expected Scene was the
PC sneaking out of the camp to report back to
her friends, but the Player generated at Interrupt
Scene instead.
Making a Turning Point to define the
Interruption, one of the Plot Points is “The
Observer”. This Plot Point is about one
Character secretly observing another Character
doing something. The Player needs to Invoke two
Characters to see who is spying on whom. The
first roll on the Characters List gets “Raiders”.
The second roll gets a blank line. The Player
decides that what makes the most sense is that
this second Character is their Player Character,

The Player’s science fiction adventure has been
going well, with Zango turning out to be an
important addition to the Player Character’s
team. They’ve learned that the warlord
leading the raiders was a deposed ruler from a
neighboring territory. He’s been ransacking the
countryside looking for an ancient artifact of
great power.

The Big Example
Let’s do one more Big Example! As in the
previous chapter, this example will use italicized
text to describe the role-played story and regular
text to explain what the Player is doing.
For this example,
the Player is using
Mythic with their
favorite superheroes
RPG, Superbreakers!
The game features
colorful superhero
action set in a
universe much like
our own, except
that super powers,
advanced science, and
A. U. THOR
alien incursions are an
every day norm.
The Player has a Character ready to go:
Rapid Red, a speedster hero who can move
supersonically fast. This is the Player’s first
adventure using this hero, so there is no history
going in. The Player has a blank copy of the
Adventure Journal and Adventure Lists.
To generate the first Scene the Player decides to
create a Random Event. Rolling on the Random
Event Focus Table they get “New NPC”. To get
some idea what this Character is doing the Player
rolls on the Actions Meaning Tables and gets
“Triumph” and “Cooperation”.
The Player interprets the Meaning words as a
group of superheroes who are tackling a problem.
Since this Event is about establishing a new NPC,
the Player decides it means this group is a team.
The Player wants to know what kind of
problem the team is taking on. Whatever it is, it’s

CHOICES, CHOICES
This example runs through a few Scenes of a
Player starting a new adventure. Various Mythic
rules are used in the example, including asking
Fate Questions and Discovering Meaning by
getting details from Meaning Tables.

SUPERBREAKERS!

One thing to keep in mind when reading this
playthrough are the times the Player chooses to
get a prompt from Mythic, and when they choose
not to. Everyone is going to play their solo games
differently, so there is no rule dictating when
you must ask a Question or get a prompt for a
detail. The decision is yours for when you want
to rely on your expectations, creating details
through improvisation, and when to stop and get
a prompt from Mythic.

A Game Of Super Mayhem By

The Player also makes use of the Elements
Meaning Tables for some details. Once again,
choosing an Elements Table, and which Table you

Personal preference and gut feeling is your friend

probably what attracts Rapid Red as well, where
he runs into the team.
The Player considers framing this as a Fate

problem is they choose to go directly to a Meaning
Table for inspiration. Rolling on the Actions
Meaning Tables, they get “Strange” and “Outside”.

177

THE BIG EXAMPLE

superhero uniform before he reaches the street.
Moving in the blink of an eye he runs to the
center of the ruckus.

Thinking about this a moment the Player
interprets this to mean there is a strange
disturbance in the center of the city. Some kind
of rip in the reality of space has opened, letting
energies from outside our world in that are
wreaking havoc.

Even though this is this Player’s first
adventure with this Character, and this is the
first Scene, decisions the Player is making are
already building Context for the adventure.

When not saving people and fighting villains,
Rapid Red is Rick Burgundy, a reporter for
the internet news site The Blurb. He’s working
at their downtown offices when news of the
disturbances start getting called in. No one needs
to be informed, however, as just looking out their
high rise windows shows the chaos below.
Since Rapid works downtown the Player
wondered if he might be close enough to the
disturbances to see them. The Player asks a Fate
Question, “Can he see what’s going on?” The Player
gives this Odds of Likely, and Mythic says Yes.
To interpret what the PC actually sees, the
Player considers Discovering Meaning again.
However, they already know that something
strange is going on and it involves rifts in reality
and another dimension leaking into our world.
The Player decides to run with what they expect
this to look like rather than get another prompt.
Looking out the window, Rick can see weird
strands of blue energy snaking between buildings.
Everything the strands touch wavers and warps,
as if reality itself were uncertain what it should
be. Sirens, car horns, and people screaming can
be heard.
It’s time for Rick to leap into action and help
save people! The Player’s expectation is that Rick
has exited work many times before in order to
act as Rapid Red, so there is no need to ask a
Question to see if he has any trouble getting away.
The Player considers if this should be the end
of the first Scene. However, it doesn’t feel quite
complete yet without Rapid getting to the site of
the disturbance first.
Making a few quick excuses at the office, Rapid
zooms down the stairwell, changing into his

Rapid Red works in a downtown office
building. He is experienced with leaving
work unnoticed when hero duty calls.
These are small but important details. Every
detail created in an adventure, whether it’s
derived from a Fate Question, a Random
Event, a Meaning Table, or your own
expectations, all becomes part of the Context
which influences later expectations. It all
builds together creating a layered, detailed,
and consistent adventure.
When setting up this first Scene the Player had
established that Rapid would encounter a new
NPC, a team dealing with the problem. Now
that the problem has been determined, this seems
like a logical time to encounter the team. This is
a well grounded expectation so the Player doesn’t
feel a need to ask a Fate Question for it.
However, the Player does ask: “Does Rapid
recognize the team helping people?” Giving
this Odds of Likely, Mythic comes back with
Exceptional Yes.
The Player interprets this to mean that not
only does Rapid recognize them but they are a
famous group of superheros.
The Player considers making up a name for
the team but figures it would be more fun to roll
up a random name. Using the Names Elements
Table they roll “Fah” and “Ow”. Needing more
inspiration the Player keeps rolling and gets “N”
and “R”. This kind of sounds like “Founder”, so the
Player goes with a team name of “The Founders”.

THE BIG EXAMPLE

rolled and the single digit value is less than or
equal to the Chaos Factor.
The Player rolls 91 on the Random Event
Focus Table, “Current Context”. Rolling on
the Actions Meaning Tables, the Player gets
“Imprison” and “Representative”.
The Player interprets this to mean that the
enormous rift in space closes as mysteriously as it
appeared, but The Founders captured someone,
or something, associated with it.
“Do I find out what’s going on?” The Player
gives this Question Odds of Nearly Certain,
figuring that since Rick helped the hero team
with the crisis they will clue him in on what
they found.
The Player already established that a
representative of the world beyond the rift had
been captured. To get some idea of what this
NPC looks like the Player turns to the Character
Appearance Elements Table, rolling “Strange”
and “Colorful”.

Arriving in the midst of downtown, Rapid sees
the arcing blue energy up close tearing apart
buildings and roads. However, people are
already being rescued by a group of superheroes:
the world famous Founders.
Rapid gets in on the action and uses his super
speed to help rescue people threatened by the
anomaly. The Player wants a situation for their
PC to get involved. There’s no need to ask a Fate
Question about this, it’s already been established
that there is general mayhem going on. There is,
undoubtedly, plenty of opportunities for Rapid
to help.
The Player decides to Discover Meaning to
help determine what emergency Rapid can help
with. Rolling on the Actions Meaning Tables,
the Player gets “Release” and “Vehicle”. The
Player interprets this to mean that a car has
been knocked to the edge of a freeway overpass
when the road got warped by the wild energies.
Someone is trapped in the car, which teeters on
the brink of plummeting to the concrete below.
Rapid moves quickly, in a blur zooming along
the road to the overpass.
“Does the car start to fall before Rapid
gets there?” The Player gives this Odds
of Nearly Impossible considering his
fantastic speed and Mythic says No.
Rapid arrives at the car, pulls the driver
out of it, and deposits them safely a block away
before they are even aware of what is going on.
The Player doesn’t want to role-play every
save in this crisis, just the one to set some flavor
for the Scene. They wonder though if the rip
in reality closes up, or if this is going to be an
ongoing situation. The Player asks “Does
the rift close?” This seems Very Likely to
the Player. With the Chaos Factor still at its
starting value of 5, they roll on the Fate Chart
getting a 22. This is a Yes, but also a Random
Event since double digits were

THE BIG EXAMPLE

The leader of The Founders beckons Rick to
join the team as they gather around something.
Laying on the ground is a strange creature. It
looks like an enormous flying eye, with bright
red, leathery skin.
“It came through the rift,” a member of The
Founders said. “We subdued it right away.”
The Player followed their expectations with
that moment. They could have asked Fate
Questions to establish more details, or Discovered
Meaning, but at this point they had a pretty good
idea how the Scene was panning out and wanted
to run with their own impressions.
The Player had earlier established that The
Founders was a superhero team, but now wants
to give them a little more detail by coming up
with some facts about a few of the members. The
Player doesn’t want to take the time to detail
every NPC on the team, but two sounds good.
Starting with the leader of The Founders, the
Player figures it would be good to know their
main power and their name. Turning to the
Powers Elements Table, the Player rolls “Others”
and “Emission”. The Player interprets this to
mean that the ability is a powerful eye beam blast.
To give the leader a name the Player rolls on
the Names Elements Table for inspiration, getting
“R” and “Wah”. The Player interprets this into
the name Ra, the hero maintains an Egyptian sun
god motif to accompany his fiery eye blasts.
For the second member of the team the
Player rolls again on the Powers Table and gets
“Damage” and “Emotion”. This is interpreted
as a mental power, the ability to control others’
emotions to make them run out of control.
Rolling on the Names Table, the Player gets
“Fi” and “Ar”. That’s not enough to make an
interpretation so the Player continues rolling and
gets “Oh” and “Ah”. The Player interprets this
into Fear Aura.
There are more members of The Founders, but
that’s enough for now. This seems like a good
place to wrap up the first Scene. The Player writes

a summary on the Adventure Journal, marking
down Scene 1. While there are a lot of unknowns
right now, such as where the rift came from and
will it return, Rapid Red and The Founders
succeeded in minimizing the crisis. The Player is
going to count this as the PC mostly being in
control of the Scene, giving the Chaos Factor a -1
modifier down to 4.

Rapid Red’s Grand Adventure
A rift in reality
causes chaos.

Editing the Adventure Lists, the Player adds
“Why the rift?” on the Threads List. On the
Characters List goes “The Founders”, “Ra”, “Fear
Aura”, and “Captured Alien”. Thinking about it a
moment, the Player decides to also put down “City”
to account for the people in the city and “The
Blurb” to represent where Rick works in his alter
ego time and the friends he has there who might
become a part of the adventure given the chance.

Why the rift?

Ra

It’s time for the next Scene. The Player
expects The Founders to take the prisoner back
to their headquarters for questioning. Given the
friendliness Ra showed Rick in the first Scene it
would make sense that the PC would accompany
the hero team.

180

THE BIG EXAMPLE

These results make the Player reconsider who
the alien is and what it represents.

The Chaos Factor is currently at 4. The Player
rolls a d10 to test this Expected Scene idea and
gets a 2, an Interrupt.
Right away the adventure is taking an
unexpected turn.
The Player needs to roll up a Random Event as
inspiration for how this unexpected Scene starts.
Rolling on the Random Events Focus Table gives
“NPC Action”. To figure out which NPC acts
the Player rolls on the Characters List. There are
6 entries on the List, just barely breaking into
the second section. This means the Player has to
roll two dice, a d4 to determine which section of
the List to roll in and a d10 to determine which
element in that section is selected.
The Player rolls a 3 and a 6. This leads us to
the second section of the Characters List and a
blank line.
When getting a blank line on a List we get the
option to choose an element on the List or to roll
again. The Player thinks it would make the most
sense if the captured alien did something. The
Founders just captured the strange visitor, which
came from another world. Who knows what it’s
capable of or what mayhem it might cause.

Back at The Founders headquarters, the alien is
kept in a containment force field. The creature
wakes and, communicating telepathically, tells
them it has come as a friend to help.
The alien saying it is friendly is certainly
unexpected, considering the amount of damage
that accompanied its arrival.
This gives the Player some ideas but before
running with them they want to get more
information from the alien. The Player rolls on
the Character Conversations Elements Table for
inspiration on what the alien says to explain itself.
The Player rolls “Inform” and “Threatening”.
This gives the Player some interpretations but
nothing they are certain of. The Player tests their
top idea with a Fate Question.
“Does it warn us of an impending invasion
from its home dimension?” That sounds like a
plausible interpretation, the Player assigns it Odds
of Likely. Checking this against the Chaos Factor
of 4 on the Fate Chart gives us a 50% chance of
being true. The Player rolls 26 for a Yes.
Before moving forward with a full interpretation
the Player figures it’s time to give the alien a name.
Rolling on the Names Elements Table they get
“Ahg” and “Animal”. The Player considers this,
and given that the alien is from another reality the
name should be something that sounds a bit odd.
The Player comes up with Ogberd.

Rolling a blank line on the Characters or
Threads List gives us the option of choosing
an element instead of randomly rolling it.
This is an opportunity for you to nudge the
narrative of your adventure in a direction
that seems the most logical or exciting.

The alien, who says his name is Ogberd, claims
he traveled to our dimension to warn us of an
impending invasion from his reality. He apologizes
for the abrupt and dangerous arrival, but opening
portals between worlds is messy business and it was
the only way he could get here.

However, if you don’t want this control or a
choice isn’t obvious you can instead choose to
roll again to let the dice decide.
The Player considers which Meaning Table to
roll on for this Random Event. It’s about the alien
doing something, so maybe the Actions Meaning
Tables. However, it’s a Character doing the action,
so perhaps one of the Character oriented tables.
They choose the Characters Elements Table.
Rolling, the Player gets “Friend” and “Unexpected”.

The Player wants to ask the Fate Question
“Do The Founders believe him?” Before
assigning Odds, the Player decides that
Rapid Red does believe Ogberd. Despite the
devastation his traveling to our realm caused his

181

THE BIG EXAMPLE

warning seems plausible. Also, if he’s correct,
they need to act now.
The Player wants this to be a role-playing
moment where the group discusses if they
believe Ogberd’s account. Using the rules of
the RPG the Player is using for this adventure,
SuperBreakers!, Rapid Red makes a Persuasion
Task Roll to convince The Founders to trust the
alien. The roll succeeds.
The Player decides not to ask the Fate
Question after all, letting the task resolution roll
decide instead.
Rick and The Founders discuss Ogberd’s claim.
As wild as it sounds, if it’s true, the entire Earth
could be at risk. The rift that disrupted downtown
was evidence enough that powerful forces are at
play. They can’t afford not to trust Ogberd.
Even though The Founders believe, it would
make sense that they try to verify the information
anyway. Since this is The Founders, a famous
group of heroes, and we are at their headquarters,
the Player figures they likely have some high tech
equipment that may help.
The Player poses this as a Fate Question,
asking “Do The Founders have some tech to help
verify Ogberd’s claim?” The Player gives this
Odds of Very Likely.
With the Chaos Factor at 4 and with Odds
of Very Likely, the Fate Chart gives this a 65%
chance of a Yes. The Player rolls 24 for Yes.
The Player considers asking more Questions,
or perhaps Discovering Meaning, to narrow down
what technology they have that would be helpful
but decides that would slow the adventure down
too much right now. The Player instead chooses
to improvise and run with their expectations.

opposing the invasion, who confirm the warning
and show The Founders what they are up against.
The Player needs to figure out what they
learned, who is invading, and how?
They start with a Fate Question, “Is this a
warlord of some kind?” The Player assigns Odds
of Nearly Certain. An alternative explanation
could be some kind of natural force or army of
creatures, but so far this all sounds like something
intentionally done by a conqueror. With a Chaos
Factor of 4 the Fate Chart gives a 75% chance.
The Player rolls 12. This is within the 75, but
such a low roll that it falls within the Exceptional
range of 15 or less. The answer is Exceptional Yes.
So the villain is a warlord and then some. Since
we’re talking about dimensional travel and the
end of worlds, the Player interprets this to mean
that the villain is not only a conqueror from
that other reality but a very powerful being that

The Founders headquarters is full of amazing
technology that Rick has never seen before. With
Ogberd’s help, a Founder scientist uses a device
to open a channel of communication between
our world and his. Ogberd is able to reach
companions of his there, members of a resistance

THE BIG EXAMPLE

rules the entire dimension. We are dealing with a
cosmic force.
The Player wants to get a better idea of what
this being is like. Discovering Meaning to
generate details, the Player rolls on the Characters
Elements Table and gets “Combative” and
“Anxious”. Combative certainly fits into what
we’ve seen so far, and anxious makes it sound like
this ruler is maybe paranoid and power hungry.
To get an idea of what powers this cosmic
being possesses, the Player rolls on the Powers
Elements Table and gets “Skill” and “Magic”. The
Player interprets this to mean that the being is a
powerful sorcerer with godlike abilities.
To give this being a name the Player rolls on
the Names Table, getting “Or” and “Tal”. The
Player wants more prompts so continues rolling,
getting “Lee” and “Et”. The Player interprets this
into Orta Leet.
This seems like a good place to end the Scene.
A lot was learned and the adventure has really
taken focus. The Player updates the Adventure
Journal, summarizing this Scene. When adjusting
the Chaos Factor, the Player considers whether
or not Rapid Red was in control. He was
instrumental in convincing The Founders to trust
Ogberd, however learning about the impending
invasion introduced a huge threat that they don’t
have an answer for. The Player decides this means
the PC was less in control, although it’s a close
call. They raise the Chaos Factor to 5.
Editing the Adventure Lists, the Player crosses
out “Why the rift?” on the Threads List. The PC
discovered why the downtown crisis happened so
that goal is solved. They add a new Thread with
“Stop the invasion.”
On the Characters List, the Player updates
“Captured Alien” to “Ogberd”, reflecting
learning his name. Characters that were
important in this Scene included “The Founders”
and “Ogberd” so the Player gives each an
additional entry on the List reflecting their
growing importance to this adventure.

The Player also adds “Orta Leet”, the cosmic
entity and threat they are facing.
Since Ogberd’s companions on the other side
were helpful the Player decides to include them on
the List as well, calling them “Resistance fighters”.
A lot happened in that Scene to change the
focus of the adventure. Rapid Red has to help
The Founders avert a dimensional invasion of
cosmic proportions.
For the next Scene, the Player figures that
if Ogberd took the trouble to travel to our
dimension he had more in mind than just
warning us. He probably has a solution. The
Player doesn’t know what this solution is yet, or if

it exists, but that sounds like a good basis for the
next Scene.
With the Chaos Factor back at 5, the Player
tests this Expected Scene by rolling a d10 and gets
7. The Expected Scene happens.
So, Ogberd has a plan. The Player decides to
ask a Fate Question to help figure out what he
has in mind. “Is there something here, on Earth,
that will help us fight Orta?” The Player just took
a wild guess with this Question, it was the first
thing that came to mind. They don’t have any
real confidence in it, however, so they assign it
Odds of 50/50. With the Chaos Factor at 5, the
chances of a Yes are 50%. The Player rolls and
Mythic says Yes.
The Player considers asking more Questions to
pinpoint what this weapon is but instead decides
to Discover Meaning by rolling on the Actions
Meaning Tables. Maybe finding out what this
thing does will help define what it is. The Player
rolls “Praise” and “Hope”.
The Player has to think about this one, and
decides to stretch the literal meaning of those
words to reach an interpretation.

Since Orta is a mystical being, the word “Praise”
almost sounds magical. “Hope” in this Context
could be protection or a way to banish Orta.
The Players goes with this interpretation:
Ogberd tells The Founders that he traveled to
Earth to warn us, but also to find a long lost
book of magic that contains a spell to banish
Orta Leet from our dimension and from his. The
book was brought here long ago by evil acolytes of
Orta as a way to hide the tome from those who
would seek to end her despotic rule.
This brings a new mission for Rapid Red, to
recover the book. The Player asks, “Does Ogberd
know where the book is?” The Player gives this
Odds of Likely. The Fate Chart says this has a
65% chance, and the roll comes back a Yes.
To figure out where the book is, the Player rolls
on the Locations Elements Meaning Table for
inspiration and gets “Confusing” and “Unpleasant”.
Ogberd says he knows where the book is, sort of.
It was ensconced in a graveyard in France several
centuries ago. He’s not sure what graveyard,
however, or where in the graveyard it is.
This is going to require some detective work to
locate the book, but Rapid has a solid lead at least.

184

THE BIG EXAMPLE

The Player knows that their PC is going to go
after the book, and figures Ogberd will go with
him. They’re not sure if any of The Founders will
go so the Player turns it into a Fate Question:
“Do any of The Founders accompany Rapid?”
Considering how important this mission is the
Player gives this Odds of Nearly Certain, an 85%
chance.
However, the Player rolls a 92 for a No. The
Player makes this interpretation:

Rapid Red’s Grand Adventure

Rapid prepares for the journey to Europe with
Ogberd, expecting members of The Founders
to go with him. He’s excited to work with the
famous team! However, he’s surprised when they
tell him that he and the visitor from another
world will be handling this mission alone.
Ra has decided that he thinks searching for the
spellbook is an uncertain solution. He and the
team are going to focus on preparing defenses
against the invasion and contacting heroes and
governments across the world to get ready.

means he is maxed out and won’t get any more
listings from future Scenes.
The Player considers adding another instance
of “The Founders” but they didn’t play a big
role in this Scene. The Player decides not to add
another listing for them.
Rapid Red’s adventure continues as he and
the visitor from another world travel to France in
order to find a spell to save the world from their
magical foe.

It’s in Rapid’s hands now to maybe save the
world, assuming that Ogberd is correct about
the spell.
The Player decides this is a good spot to end
the Scene. This Scene was mostly information,
answering questions about the looming crisis and
deciding what to do next.
The Player updates the Adventure Journal with
a Scene 3 summary. Since this Scene involved
coming up with a plan of action to stop Orta, a
plan that Rapid is centrally involved in, the Player
decides that their PC was in control of this Scene
and lowers the Chaos Factor to 4.
The Player updates the Threads List by adding
another line for “Stop the invasion”, since that
was a big part of this Scene, and also adds “Find
the book”.
On the Characters List, the Player adds another
line for “Ogberd” since the planning in this Scene
mostly revolved around him. That’s Ogberd’s
third appearance on the Characters List, which

Points on the Track to trigger a Flashpoint, and
one hasn’t already occurred in that phase of the
Track, then a Flashpoint event happens. Treat
this as a Random Event with an automatic
Event Focus of Current Context.

K
  EYED SCENE EVENT: Decide what
happens when the Trigger occurs. The Event
happens at the beginning of the next Scene.

Using Mythic With
Prepared Adventures

D
  ISCOVERY CHECK: Make a Discovery
Check when forward momentum has stalled
and you are out of ideas for how to proceed.
Ask the Fate Question “Is something
discovered?” Assign the Question Odds of no
less than 50/50.

S
  CALING: Decide on a scaling factor for
your Player Character in relation to the
adventure. Roughly, how powerful are they in
comparison to what the adventure is designed
for? Represent this comparison with a single
number that becomes the Diminisher Value.
For instance, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, etc.

-Y
  es: Roll on the Thread Discovery
Check Table.
-N
  o: Nothing useful is found.

A
  PPLY DIMINISHER: Apply the
Diminisher Value to all challenges met in the
adventure, reducing the number of encounters,
NPC statistics, and other values that challenge
your Player Character.

-E
  xceptional Yes: Roll twice on the
Thread Discovery Check Table.
-  Exceptional No: Nothing useful is found
and you cannot make another Discovery
Check during the rest of this Scene.

R
  EAD INTRO: Read introductory portions
of the prepared adventure.

P
  LOT ARMOR: The Focus Thread cannot be
resolved through normal Mythic play as long as
the Thread Progress Track is still in progress.

RULES SUMMARY

Peril Points

P
  REPARE LISTS: Include any relevant
Threads or NPCs onto your Lists that seem
important from the adventure introduction.

Use Peril Points to change the narrative.
D
  ECIDE QUANTITY: Choose how many
Peril Points your Player Character gets. The
default number is 2.

A
  DVENTURE FEATURES: Create a third
List, Adventure Features, and include on it
anything special about the prepared adventure
that you think should be on the List.

D
  ECIDE IF THEY REPLENISH: Choose
if Peril Points reset to the quantity you chose at
the start of each adventuring session, or if they
are a one-time resource that does not replenish.

F
  IRST SCENE: Create a first Scene based off
of how the prepared adventure suggests starting.
P
  LAY SCENE BY SCENE: Play through the
adventure Scene by Scene, as you would with a
normal Mythic adventure, using the content of
the prepared adventure as Context.

E
  XPEND PERIL POINTS: Use a Peril Point
to avert an outcome that would otherwise end
the adventure or an important narrative.

T
  ESTING EXPECTED SCENES: Test
Scenes as normal, however instead of using
Altered and Interrupt Scenes, whenever you roll
equal to or less than the Chaos Factor you still
have the Expected Scene but it also starts with
a Random Event.

Mythic With The
Adventure Crafter
F
  IRST SCENE: Generate a Turning Point or
two for inspiration for the first Scene.

E
  NCOUNTERS AND LOCATIONS:
When reading new sections of the prepared
adventure, read as little as possible before
deciding Player Character actions.

I  NTERRUPT SCENES: Replace Random
Events with Turning Points to generate
Interrupt Scenes.
L
  ISTS: Use Mythic’s List system instead
of The Adventure Crafter’s Lists method.
References to Plotlines are considered Threads.
When rolling on a List for a Plot Point roll on
the full List, not just the sections that have
elements in them.

A
  SK FATE QUESTIONS: Use Fate
Questions to decide the details and outcomes
of encounters when there is doubt.
R
  ANDOM EVENTS: Use the Prepared
Adventure Event Focus Table instead of the
regular Random Event Focus Table.

C
  HOOSE ...: When rolling an empty line on
a List for a Plot Point you have the additional
choice of Add A Thread or Add A Character.
If you Choose to select a Character on the
Characters List, you can include the Player
Character as an option even though they aren’t
on the List.

PLAYER VS. PC KNOWLEDGE
STRATEGY

SOLUTION

TEST IT, ASK IT,
THEN IT’S REAL

PC checks for discovery
before asking a Fate
Question if it exists.

RELIABLE VS.
UNRELIABLE
INFORMATION

Player knowledge is not
official adventure canon
until the PC discovers it,
allowing for the chance
for it to be wrong.

GOING WITH IT

Embracing Player knowledge
from a cinematic, bigpicture view. Prioritize
enjoying the totality of the
adventure over surprises.

EXTRA
KNOWLEDGE
AS AN RP
OPPORTUNITY

Player knowledge triggers
an opportunity for the
PC to earn it, “gamifying”
the knowledge gap.

USING THE ADVENTURE
CRAFTER WITH MYTHIC
ADVENTURE
ELEMENT

RULES

FIRST SCENE

Create a first Scene by
generating at least one
Turning Point. Interpret
this into an opening Scene,
perhaps using some of
the details as background.
Add any NPCs and Threads
generated onto the Lists.

INTERRUPT
SCENES

Instead of generating a Random
Event to define an Interrupt,
make a Turning Point.

LISTS

»

Use Mythic Lists instead of
Adventure Crafter Lists.

»

Add Threads and Characters
to their Lists as they are
generated in Turning Points.

»

When rolling on a List for
a Thread or Character
Invoked by a Plot Point,
roll on the full List, not
just the sections that
have elements in them.

»

Rolling an empty line
on a List for a Plot Point
gives you an additional
Choice: Add a New Thread
or Add A New NPC.

»

Only Non-Player Characters
go on the Characters List,
not Player Characters.

»

When Choosing an element
on the Characters List you
can always Choose a Player
Character even though
they are not on the List.
