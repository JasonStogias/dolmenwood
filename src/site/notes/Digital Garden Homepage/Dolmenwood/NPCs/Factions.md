Here’s a comprehensive description of the main factions in Dolmenwood, detailing their histories, goals, and interrelationships:

### 1. The Duchy of Brackenwold  
The Duchy is the dominant human power in Dolmenwood, ruled from Castle Brackenwold by the Duke and his noble family. Their claim over the land goes back to the earliest human settlers who fought to subdue the magical and chaotic influences that once held sway here. The Duchy considers itself the rightful authority over all mortal inhabitants and exerts control through a network of vassal baronies and fortified settlements. Their influence is strongest in the southern regions of Dolmenwood, near the settled areas, but becomes less certain as one ventures deeper into the forest where other powers hold sway. The Duchy aims to maintain order, promote human civilization, and defend against threats from within and beyond the forest.  

**Relationships**:  
- **Pluritine Church**: The Duchy has a historically strong connection with the Church, which helped legitimize its rule. However, the relationship has strained over time as the Church’s power has declined in Dolmenwood, leading to disputes over the allocation of resources and the influence over local communities.  
- **The Drune**: The Duchy sees the Drune as a direct threat to its authority, given their secretive control over the forest’s magical energies. Their practices are considered a danger to the Duke’s vision of law and order.  
- **The Nag-Lord**: The Duke views the Nag-Lord as a dangerous foe whose corrupted followers and chaotic forces pose a significant threat to the northern reaches of Dolmenwood. The Duchy is often engaged in efforts to push back the influence of this malevolent being.  

### 2. Pluritine Church  
The Pluritine Church is the main religious institution in Dolmenwood and the surrounding regions, devoted to a monotheistic faith centered around a single deity. It once held significant power in the area, but as pagan practices and the magic of the forest regained prominence, its influence has waned. Many ancient shrines and chapels that were once sites of pilgrimage now lie abandoned, overgrown, or defiled by magical forces. The Church is working to regain its foothold in Dolmenwood, seeking to restore these holy places, convert the local populace back to the faith, and combat heresy wherever it arises.  

**Relationships**:  
- **The Duchy of Brackenwold**: While there is a historic alliance between the Church and the Duchy, the current state of affairs is tense. The Duchy has grown more independent, sometimes prioritizing political expediency over religious dogma.  
- **The Drune**: The Church considers the Drune to be heretical and believes they engage in blasphemous practices. There are often direct conflicts, as the Church seeks to eliminate their influence and reclaim sacred sites from the Drune’s hold.  
- **The Witches**: The Church sees witches as corrupt agents of dark forces, frequently seeking to eradicate their covens and practices.  

### 3. The Drune  
The Drune are a mysterious and ancient cabal of sorcerers who wield the deep magical energies of Dolmenwood. They are thought to guard ancient secrets and have a profound connection to the ley lines, standing stones, and other mystical features of the forest. The Drune operate in secrecy and are often feared or reviled by the common folk, who associate them with dark magic and dangerous rituals. Their true motives remain opaque, but it is clear they seek to preserve the power of the forest and bend it to their will.  

**Relationships**:  
- **The Duchy of Brackenwold**: The Drune are at odds with the Duchy, as they resist any efforts to impose mortal rule over the magical aspects of Dolmenwood. Their control over certain areas is a point of contention.  
- **The Pluritine Church**: There is deep animosity between the Drune and the Church, with the Church actively persecuting them. The Drune, in turn, see the Church as a threat to the natural magical order of the forest.  
- **The Cold Prince**: Although the Drune had some involvement in the conflict that led to the Cold Prince’s exile, they remain wary of his potential return and the chaos it could bring.  

### 4. The Cold Prince  
The Cold Prince is a powerful elf lord who once ruled over all of Dolmenwood from his palace at Hoarblight Keep, near Lake Longmere. He was driven into exile by the combined forces of mortal settlers and other magical beings, but many believe he bides his time, plotting a return to reclaim his domain. Tales of his icy wrath and the enduring magic of his realm remain prevalent in the folklore of Dolmenwood.  

**Relationships**:  
- **The Duchy of Brackenwold**: The Cold Prince harbors a deep grudge against the Duchy for its role in his downfall and views the Duke’s rule as illegitimate. He would likely seek to reclaim Dolmenwood and expel the human settlers upon his return.  
- **The Drune**: The Drune played a part in his banishment and would be opposed to his return, as it could upset the balance of power and disrupt their own control over the forest’s magic.  
- **The Witches**: Some witches may secretly support the Cold Prince’s return, hoping to gain favor or power in the process, though others view him as a rival or threat.  

### 5. The Nag-Lord  
The Nag-Lord is a malevolent entity that rules from the corrupted northern woods of Dolmenwood, where his unholy court holds sway. He is often depicted in folklore as a wicked trickster, part man and part unicorn, with his court consisting of chaotic and corrupted creatures. His presence warps the land, causing blighted trees and twisted paths to proliferate in the north. The Nag-Lord seeks to spread his influence across all of Dolmenwood, opposing both the Duchy and other lawful powers.  

**Relationships**:  
- **The Duchy of Brackenwold**: There is open hostility between the Nag-Lord and the Duchy, with the Duke’s forces actively seeking to contain or push back his influence in the northern regions.  
- **The Witches**: Some witches are drawn to the power of the Nag-Lord, though many fear his chaotic nature. There are alliances of convenience but little trust.  
- **The Cold Prince**: The Nag-Lord and the Cold Prince share a mutual disdain for each other, with each regarding the other as a rival for dominance over the magical realms of Dolmenwood.  

### 6. The Witches  
The witches of Dolmenwood are a loose collection of magic users who operate outside the bounds of traditional authority. They are known for their ancient rites, pacts with spirits, and mastery of enchantments and curses. While many witches work alone, there are covens that gather to practice more potent rituals. The common folk often see them as either wise healers or dangerous sorceresses, depending on local folklore. Their goals are usually centered around personal power, knowledge, or the preservation of ancient magical practices.  

**Relationships**:  
- **The Pluritine Church**: The Church actively opposes the witches, seeing them as enemies of the faith and representatives of dark magic. The witches, in turn, avoid direct confrontation when possible but will defend themselves with magic.  
- **The Drune**: There is a cautious relationship between the witches and the Drune. While there are occasional collaborations on rituals or shared secrets, there is also competition for control over the forest’s magical energies.  
- **The Cold Prince**: Some witches hold lingering loyalty to the Cold Prince, while others oppose his potential return due to the threat it poses to their own influence in the forest.  

The interplay between these factions adds to the complexity of Dolmenwood, creating a landscape rife with shifting alliances, old grudges, and simmering conflicts.
