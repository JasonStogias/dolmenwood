## Capital of the Duchy of Brackenwold and seat of the duke

The seat of the Duchy of Brackenwold and ancestral home to the nobility of the line, Castle Brackenwold perches upon a high hill with a city stretched at its feet. Alongside the mighty ducal garrison is a great cathedral—the seat of the Church’s power in Dolmenwood.

Ruling from the supposedly impregnable Castle Brackenwold on the south-eastern verge of the forest, the Dukes of Brackenwold trace their line back to the earliest settlers in the region. All mortal folk within the Wood—from the humblest beggar to the highest lord—pay fealty to the
duke. The whole forest is his property.

## Ancient fortress town
A great, walled town sits sprawled upon the hillside at the feet of the fortified castle and keep. Castle Brackenwold is an ancient place whose oldest parts  
were used by elf lords in ancient times, before the people of Brackenwold migrated to Dolmenwood.  

## Seat of the duke and the Pluritine Church
At the summit  of a hill, the ducal keep is the ancestral home to the nobility  of the Brackenwold line. Alongside the mighty garrison  maintained by the duke is a great cathedral, making this  fortress-town also the centre of the Church’s power in the  
region. Indeed, the Bishop of Brackenwold holds sway over Dolmenwood equal to the duke himself.
