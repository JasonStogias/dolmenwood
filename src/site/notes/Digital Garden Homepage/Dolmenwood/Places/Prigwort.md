Famed brewing and market town in the heart of the Wood.

Situated in a hilly clearing in the deep woods, Prigwort is a market town famed for its breweries, inns, and taverns. 

Within the confines of the town wall, twisting alleys and crooked stairways weave between quaint wooden cottages and high-gabled inns, all decorated with colourful, pseudo-heraldic imagery and elaborate wood carving.  

Ruler: The Elevated Council of Brewmasters sees to the day-to-day running of Prigwort, as representatives of [[Digital Garden Homepage/Dolmenwood/NPCs/House Harrowmoor\|Lady Harrowmoor]]. 

Religion: It is said (by outsiders) that Prigwort folk glorify ale above all. In reality, it would be fair to say that the church and the tavern share equal space in their hearts
