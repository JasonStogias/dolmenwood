Mx Whiskers' family’s tragic death, initially thought to be a result of accidental poisoning, is tied to darker, more sinister forces within Dolmenwood. Here’s what really happened:

The family unknowingly fell victim to a **Drune curse**. The Drune, a cabal of sorcerers that roam Dolmenwood, are known for their mastery of dark magic and rituals. Unbeknownst to Mx Whiskers, one of its parents had crossed paths with the Drune—either by inadvertently trespassing on one of their sacred sites or perhaps becoming involved in a secret conflict with them. This led to the Drune placing a curse on the family, which manifested in the form of the toxic food that caused their deaths.

The poisoning was not from any mundane substance but was instead an alchemical concoction infused with **magical poison** that affected only those marked by the Drune. The exact nature of the poison and the curse remains hidden, and the truth has been kept obscured by local authorities and perhaps even powerful figures in Lankshorn, who feared reprisal from the Drune.

As Mx Whiskers delves deeper into its study of enchantment and magic, it begins to uncover clues that point toward this conspiracy. The family's death wasn’t a simple tragedy but part of a broader mystery involving the Drune and their ancient influence over Dolmenwood. Mx Whiskers’ quest to **find out the truth** and to ensure no one else it cares for suffers the same fate is what drives it forward, though the deeper it goes, the more dangerous it becomes.

The discovery that its family’s deaths were **intentional and magical** will be a pivotal moment for Mx Whiskers, reshaping its understanding of the world and leading to difficult choices about how to seek justice—or vengeance.
