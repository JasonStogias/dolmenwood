## Castle Everdusk

 Ancestral home of [[Dolmenwood/NPCs/House Ramius\|Lord Ramius]] (and of [[Dolmenwood/NPCs/House Malbleat\|Lord Malbleat]]), most powerful of the longhorn nobles.
 
Castle Everdusk is a stone keep located deep in the tangled woods atop a steep, bare hill, which looms over a palisaded garrison at its base. The castle serves as the ancestral seat of House Ramius, long-established nobles who have ruled the High Wold for many generations. It is a place of austere architecture, surrounded by ancient towers and protected by a stockade of pine trunks emblazoned with the thorned eye emblem of House Ramius.

The interior of the keep is known for its oddly proportioned chambers and thick furnishings, which still fail to dispel the chill that seems to permeate the entire structure. The most lived-in area is Lord Ramius's study, where he often huddles by the fire in thought. Additionally, the castle houses ancestral crypts and icy caverns below, which add to its sense of history and mystery​

## Castle Knights

A knight of House Ramius would have an intimate knowledge of Castle Everdusk and its surroundings, including:

1. **Structure and Layout**  
   The knight would be familiar with the castle’s defensive features, including its stone walls, ancient towers, and the steep hill upon which it stands. The main keep is built to be imposing, with narrow windows and thick walls, designed to withstand sieges. The palisade surrounding the base of the hill adds an extra layer of defense. Inside the keep, the knight would know the layout of key rooms, including Lord Ramius's study, the great hall, armory, barracks, and the ancestral crypts below. The oddly proportioned chambers and chill that pervades the structure are well-known quirks to those who reside there.

2. **History and Ancestry**  
   The knight would be versed in the history of House Ramius, who have ruled the High Wold for generations. The thorned eye emblem, proudly displayed on the stockade and banners, symbolizes the house's vigilance and resilience. The knight would also be aware of the lore surrounding the castle's crypts, where the remains of past Ramius lords rest, and would have respect for the ancestral traditions and rituals performed there.

3. **Legends and Superstitions**  
   Castle Everdusk is known for its pervasive chill, which even roaring fires struggle to dispel. Some say it is the lingering presence of the spirits of past lords, or the influence of ancient magic within the stone. A knight would be familiar with these tales and might hold certain superstitions, such as avoiding certain rooms or honoring specific rituals to appease the spirits.

4. **Duties and Responsibilities**  
   The knight would have duties related to the defense and upkeep of Castle Everdusk. This would include training in the courtyard, patrolling the walls, and safeguarding the ancestral crypts. They would also be responsible for ensuring the loyalty of the garrison and maintaining the palisaded defenses.

5. **Secret Passages and Hidden Areas**  
   As part of their training, a knight might be aware of secret passages within the castle that could be used during a siege or to move discreetly. These passages could lead to the crypts, the caverns below, or even hidden exits from the castle.

This knowledge would prepare the knight to not only defend the castle but also uphold the traditions and honor of House Ramius.
